# PM: Okay , well I think we're ready to begin . # PM: my name's Adam Duguid , we're here because of real reaction , we have in the group # ME: Ebenezer Ademesoye . # ME: Would you like me to spell that ? # PM: go for it mate . # PM: And your role is ? # ME: I'm the Marketing Expert . # PM: You're the Marketing Expert , okay . # ID: Tarik Rahman . T_A_R_I_K_ . # PM: And your role in this is ? # ID: Industrial Designer . # PM: Industrial Designer . # PM: And , lastly we have ? # UI: , Dave Cochrane . # PM: And you're going to be the User Interface , # UI: User Interface Defin Designer , yes . # PM: Designer . Okay . # PM: This is the agenda for today's meeting . As you can see , w opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . # PM: , we already got n through opening , and partially through acquaintance . # PM: the reason we're here , we're gonna design a new remote control , as you probably all know . # PM: The very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . # PM: Course , we'll have to go into a bit more detail than that , but personally I think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design . # PM: , there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . # PM: This is how today seems to be going to work . # PM: We're gonna have the three kay phases , as you've probably already been told , the functional , architectural , and the detailed design . # PM: First one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design . # PM: Second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far . # PM: Of course , you've all got the similar emails , I believe , What can I say ? # PM: Ebenezer , you wanna have a you wanna draw your favourite animal ? # ME: I will make this quick , since we don't have much time . # ME: it's not the best picture in the world . # ME: Here we have an elephant . # ME: First point , begins with an E_ , same like Ebenezer . # ME: Also , elephants have a very good memory , much like myself , and I can't remember back when I used to live back in Nigeria , but I think I used to have a pet elephant . # ME: elephants are big , strong and gentle , and they have great memories , and they begin with the letter E_ , just like Ebenezer . # PM: Brilliantly done . # PM: Tarik , would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry ? # PM: you can clip them to your belt . # ID: Do we take them off ? # ME: I think you ga # PM: You should also l have your the lapel mic on as well . # ME: The little The the Oh that's good , we can clip them on . # ID: where do I put the # ME: Just somewhere # PM: the , it's just across there , that's it . # ID: Is this supposed to be clipped as well ? # PM: It'll follow you # PM: You can probably just stick it in your pocket for now , I wouldn't worry too much . # PM: Should have good range . # ID: , destroying your elephant here . # ID: , here we have a tiger . # ID: I've always loved tigers . # ID: They're just they're big , they're biggest cats , I did a project on cats in the wild when I was a kid and it was my favourite cat , just 'cause it was looks the best , the stripes , orange . # ID: My dad used to talk about he's from Bangladesh so he used to tell me all about them when he was when I was a kid . # ID: And they're just the most feared of animals in the wild . # ID: that's why I like them . # ID: Didn't say an anything about me really # PM: Excellent , thank you very much . # PM: Dave , if you'd like to have a dash . # UI: The one f in fact this is a somewhat oblique reference in fact to I have a three y year old daughter who h who is affectionately known as Miss Monkey . # UI: , monkeys have attitude . # UI: Which I think is a good thing . # UI: And I mean fr and from the point of view of sort of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting . # UI: , so I like monkeys . # UI: And and th thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most . # PM: Hardly what I'd call the best drawing in the world but it'll do for now . # PM: Also not quite as feared as your average tiger , but cats are one of my favourite animals , they're very independent , they're snotty as hell at the best of times , and , what can you say , you got to love those qualities in an animal . # PM: I think we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it , on to it . # PM: Project finance . As you can see , twelve point five Euros per unit . # PM: That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware , and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five . # PM: If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them . # ME: that was profiting , that was an amount , so that's the amount made , # PM: fifty million , and if you're making twelve point five Euros on each one , then , awful lot need to be sold . # PM: Now we better actually just get on with the meat of the project . # PM: I'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls . # PM: Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ? # UI: one thing I'm aware of is , th there at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , so you get the sort of you get you can redesign the interface to your own needs , you can programme in macros , and you get a much greater degree um I mean you get in these sort of three in one , five in one , whatevers , but you can get integration between the different the diff the different things that it's designed to control , to a much greater extent , and you can have one you know one macro to turn the you know turn the T_V_ to the right channel , get the re rewind the tape in the V_C_R_ and get it to play once it's rewound , for instance . # UI: b it occurs to me there might be a niche for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design . # UI: And therefore putting it into a well much lower price bracket . # PM: , tha that's true , with the price range we're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our # UI: Absolutely prohibitive , # PM: But you think again something to control multiple units in a simple fashion . # UI: I mean I wouldn't like to say you g I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , but something that could operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion . # UI: and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for running macros . # PM: Would the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the T_V_ , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of # UI: For instance , let's say oh , or you know you pr you press say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well , # PM: Okay , that sounds like a good strong idea . # PM: Any takes on this ? # ME: I've noticed that gaming c is becoming quite popular with television , when I was younger we used to e play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers , but our remote controls would get worn out really easily , and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar , keypad , for playing games . # ME: So perhaps one that was more specialised for game playing or interactive television . # ME: They they've recently brought out this new remote control , for people to set their favourite channels , or to record things . # ME: Instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins , and slide another bar to say what time it ends , you know that's # PM: I've heard I've seen the bar-code design before , # ME: it's taken out the Y you don't have to be really clever to use a remote control . # ME: I think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot . # ME: , you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television , so you need buttons to change the television angle , the camera angles and stuff like that . # PM: Okay , well we're beginning to run out of time now , we've got a couple of ideas , we'll have to work fast , alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting , so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , how the user interface might work , that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of some kind of macros facility because you have to program it , you have to have a lot of response back , or at least some kind . # PM: And we're gonna maybe n try and have to figure out # ME: What the user wants . # PM: what the user wants , yes . # PM: Has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage , anything they think that might have been missed so far ? # ID: when you're talking about gaming and stuff , do you think they should have some sort of stick on it , rather than buttons ? # ID: Like control pads , you know of games , or is that a bit ridiculous ? # PM: I don't see why not , almost everybody is probably used to a console by now , and all of them incorporate small keypads on them , in fact even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well , so it's probably an interface that most people are used to . # PM: and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well . # UI: The other key feature that would be a good idea built into it is t is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic , something that just fits as comfortably as possible into the hand . # UI: But of course , al also allows for the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive sha shape for it overall , . # PM: small , stylish , and something that's just a little different . # UI: Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form , which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway . # PM: That's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily . # PM: I would I would have hoped so anyway . # PM: I'd say we finish this one up , we get started , I'll get in , I'll write up what we've kind of quickly done , and I'll get that out to everybody . # PM: , as far as I'm aware we leave the microphones here , unless we get told otherwise , and just take the laptops with us .
# ME: Just put it on the deskt desktop . # PM: on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's a project documents link . # PM: actually just there . # ME: Project documents , # PM: If you dump it in there . # ME: What's your username ? # PM: Your username . # ME: What's your username and password ? # PM: Hopefully that's us ready to go . # PM: Functional design meeting . # PM: We'll have to flesh out some of the stuff . # PM: we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting . # PM: Not a lot thankfully to say . # PM: We introduced ourselves , discussed the possibility of a macro facility , interac interacting the T_V_ a bit more , mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , and ergonomics of the remote control as well . # PM: it's come to my attention the following . # PM: Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . # PM: Remote control should only be used for the T_V_ . due for time to market and possibly also cost issues . # PM: also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable , f your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there . # PM: Just to say quickly I would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required . # PM: or at l its functionality would have been of limited use . # PM: to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing . # PM: if anybody disagrees we can definitely say so . # PM: and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going . # PM: I'd like to if possible hear from our Marketing Expert first , to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go . # PM: I'll just load up your presentation from here if you want . # ME: , sh would you like to I'll just do it from here . # ME: , try second one maybe . # ME: Oh , I thought I put in my last name , I guess not , # PM: that's all right . # PM: do you want me to just cycle through it for you or ? # ME: Oh , that'd be fine , that'd be great . # ME: Functional requirement by me Ebenezer . # ME: Okay , so we did some research , we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls . # ME: We asked some open ended questions , just , what are your opinions on the remote control , got a lot of re responses , and we asked some very specific questions , and we got a lot of good feedback . # ME: Please bear in mind this is only a hundred people , so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , there's only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group . # ME: some the bad stuff we got , remotes are often lost . # ME: I often lose my remote control , the back of the couch , some place , and even if it's not lost permanently , it takes me a few minutes to find it . # ME: Most buttons are not used any more , like you said , teletext is outdated now . # ME: I remember trying to load a D_V_D_ player recently , and there were so many buttons , it took me I don't know maybe ten minutes to go through each button , 'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons , you know there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses . # ME: And if they do , not very often . # ME: Takes too long to master the remote control . # ME: I've seen some remote controls that are big , they have a lot of buttons , you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something , they're just not great to use . # ME: We just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls , people do not like remote controls . # ME: Some of the good stuff we got . # ME: Between the age of fifteen and twenty five , most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software . # ME: Now don't get excited yet , I've got more to say on that . # ME: Most people'd be willing to pay for that most people want remote controls to be pretty , they want it to be fancy , th they want it to be different , everybody has a white remote control with black buttons , and a red button and a green button , not everybody wants that . # ME: Finally , my opinion . # ME: The voice recognition thing is cool . # ME: And voice recognition , the software , open source software exist already . # ME: It's a bit sketchy at some times , you're not gonna get good always accurate results , but for a very fixed number of words , you know you have , how many different words can you have for a remote control , up , down , left , right , channel five , channel seven , you know , how many , you can't have that many words . # ME: For a fixed vocabulary it works quite well . # ME: I'm pretty sure people would buy it . # ME: But after a while people may wanna return it , because if you have to say som I mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels , and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time . # ME: Using the remote control , ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels , and that's for flickering through channels . # ME: So if you have to say up , up , up , up , if you have to do that all the time , then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it . # ME: However , oh , because the voice recognition software exists already , there's no need to spend money on research and development , but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control , which is an unusual feature in my opinion . # ME: But if we do have the voice recognition thing , there's a lot of stuff that you can get rid of . # ME: See , you could there're two options . # ME: Either you have voice recognition by itself , which I think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet , or I don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you , it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . # ME: So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote . # ME: But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , because there are no restrictions on physical size , or shape , it could be as fancy as you want it to be , you know , it could be like a lollipop or something like that , something weird like that . # ME: As long as the voice recognition stuff works , that's fine . # ME: we have the three birds , we have the design , we have the fancy bit , the voice recognition's fancy , it's cool , it's different , it's radical , and then we have an extra bit I don't remember I'm pretty sure people will buy the remote , but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control , I think is a big question . # ME: , will people will people be willing to wait for the period that it'll take to train the remote , 'cause I think it will the remote will get better over time with the same user , but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to wait , are you willing to have a bad remote control . # ME: And what if you have visitors come round , they stay the night , they wanna use the T_V_ , they can't use the remote because they speak differently to you . # ME: , how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that . # ME: will people return the remote control , I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , you know , so , # ME: do our audience have the money , but would they return it after a while because it's not as fast as pressing a button , it's not a practical . # ME: These are things I think we should consider . # ME: I think it's cool , # PM: if you could speed it up a bit , . # PM: If you could speed it up a bit please , . # ME: I'm about to end , . # ME: I think it's cool but there are definitely some considerations . # PM: Okay . Excellent . # PM: Hear from the User Interface Designer now I think might be an idea . # PM: you've got your presentation now , # ID: How did where did # UI: it's in the it's in the folder # ID: where did you get all your in information ? # ME: There was a website , # PM: Technical functions ? # UI: this is a brief run through of the of the technical functions of the remote . # UI: As is the presentation is already slightly obsolete because I had in mind something that would be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices but there's still stuff of relevance , press on . # UI: I've looked at looked at a num couple of other remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles . # UI: and wasn't really satisfied by what I saw I have to say so this is more sort of springboard for how these could be improved on . # UI: basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance , in this case the television set . # UI: to save you getting off your backside . # UI: and there's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice . # UI: On the one hand and this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so many buttons on it so about the size of the television set . # UI: giving you every possible function that the that the device has , the remote control controls . # UI: And most of these functions are not going to be used , it creates a rather user unfriendly interface . # UI: And on the other hand there's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what is most likely to get used . # UI: With a and a and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously , but mostly that's relatively peripheral functions . # UI: And so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use , and well f the for the most part for T_V_ remote it's tha that would be channel control and volume . # UI: and if you if you if you are wanting to incorporate control of a D_V_ D_V_D_ or V_C_R_ presumably into that then there's a play , pause , stop , rewind , fast-forward , record , so forth . # UI: My own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design . # UI: but the pro I think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what a given user's going to want mo want to do from want it to do most . # UI: something that's something that is more programmable , that perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want . # UI: so that those are then immediately accessible through fairly minimal number of controls , I liked Ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons , and have a disp you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what you know each direction of the of the joystick's going to do or wha or what each function button's going to do . # UI: , this is actually a again slightly taking inspiration off of games controllers , you know the Playstation control where you have four basic function buttons that are just marked with distinctive geometrical shapes but the and then dependent on what you're doing with it what game and so on those functions are then sort of further specified . # UI: And so it's taking the lead from that . # PM: if we could hear from our Industrial engineer , or Designer . # ID: , I was still working on stuff , I hadn't got it finished . # ID: Click to save in where do I have to save it ? # PM: If you look on the desktop you'll find that there's a link to the project folder , or project documents . # PM: If you save it in there we can open it up from here . # ID: , what I've done with it , I'm sorry . # PM: Are you finding it okay # ID: I'm just closing it now . # ID: where I've saved it . # ME: Well like if you go to one , whichever one you were working # ID: that's it there , # ME: and you just click file save as . # ID: I'm responsible for working design , this is basically the inside going on of the remote control . # ID: So we have the energy source , we have the user interface , this is what I've seen . # ID: the sender will push the button , the chip will respond , and then the dig digital signal is sent to the T_V_ . # ID: if you go to next slide , you'll see you'll see what do we need on the user interface . # ID: Do we need many buttons , or do we need l many light bulbs that could be easier to realise which appliances are on or not . # ID: , or would that take too much power , would we need more components in there to supply the power ? # ID: , the joystick is another thing , if we were gonna add that , there'd be more components to deal with that . # ID: we need to I dunno exactly what That's the design of the layout of the electronic design , obviously there'll be more details once we've decided what we're putting on the user interface . # ID: that'll be decided , I guess . # ID: , and the next slide . # ID: if you go to the next slide then . # ID: I just used the it was a mess , I was just putting adding it together at the end there . # PM: don't worry about it at all mate . # ID: you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip , and the user interface obviously contains everything . # ID: You have the switch turn it on , infrared bulb , will contact the T_V_ and will have whatever device or D_V_D_ player , the bulb will turn on to say it's on . # ID: do we need on the control different buttons to decide , or different light bulbs , would it be easier ? # ID: , I dunno what we should decide on that . # PM: Oh sorry , I'm interrupting you . # ID: it's finished , . # PM: Okay . Right . , right we can probably skip that for now . # PM: we've had some stuff put forward , along with the new user requirements , we've had a lot of kind of input I'd say so far . # PM: I hear what the Marketing Expert's saying about voice activated control . # PM: However I've got a couple of worries about that . # PM: The power required , and the ability to the cost , it seems like for an embedded system , this could cause us issues . # PM: for example you see that there's fairly robust services on computers via voice , I_B_M_ do drag and dictate , but these require a lot of memory and usually state quite advanced processor requirements . # PM: voice activation could be an interesting idea but I think that our Ind Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible . # PM: that's just my view right now , however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an L_C_D_ which has been kind of put forward so far , it's almost like having a small T_ not T_V_ to say , but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , I don't know how much power an L_C_D_ would take , but it might be quite low ? # ID: L_C_D_ on the remote just telling you what's on , or , interactive L_C_D_ or # PM: literally if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than those on a mobile phone , something where you can read an fair amount of information , traverse maybe quite a few menus , if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example , they usually incorporate they have the keypad , and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around . # PM: That could be one possibility . # PM: and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say , volume control , changing channels # UI: I was thinking that the remote the sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for volume , left and right for channels . # ID: Do you think that people will get mixed up , they'll be looking at this screen and that screen and then , you know , trying to get everything working , would it be a bit confusing ? # UI: I think probably for the first couple of hours of using it but you know muscle memory's a wonderful thing , . # UI: And I think and I think that size of display was about what I had in mind . # UI: though I mean I w I would say that we could probably be required to mo most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour but we should probably try to stick to black and white . # PM: I would agree with you . # UI: Si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down . # UI: I mean colour could be a sort of subsequent development but you know cost a bit of extra money f w once everyone's got the first , you know , oh colour's out , we'll have to replace it won't we . # UI: It does nothing extra . # PM: That would be my feeling as well , I think we could possibly create quite a useful user interface . # ME: but the idea of a remote with a menu or and a joystick I think like I h if I was in the habit of buying remote controls then I would want one , # ME: but I think we don't have a specific audience , you know , like what is our target audience , what niche are niche are we trying to market and corner . # ME: You know , you know what I'm saying , for whom is this intended ? # PM: I think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile . # PM: And that might be just another way of saying try to target most people . # PM: , if we are if we were to follow that avenue , we might be s you know we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone I suppose . # PM: But that does cover a very large section of the people out there . # ME: Sure . I think that's fair . # PM: I imagine as well that the actual L_C_D_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality . # PM: Which maybe doesn't get used as often , maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it . # PM: and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off , d up and down , it depends , maybe we have the fol the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then , that there's just a small number of as you were saying buttons that have already been defined . # PM: So like we go for the nice standard up and down for and volume control . # PM: So that literally anybody can come along , pick up the remote and still know what do . # PM: And they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the o actual owner of the T_V_ and who would normally use the unit . # UI: Mm . I th the thing I like about the joystick # UI: is that you then basically you can then basically put it I mean for T_ for T_V_ remote alone , you could put I mean there are like I say the main things people do with a T_V_ remote control is the volume and the channel . # UI: You can pack all that onto was onto a single control . # UI: But but the but then o obviously if you know if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you then get to sort of menu navigation . # UI: I mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels you know adjusting brightn brightness and fiddly things that no one really bothers with , most T_V_s these days actually have menus anyway so this would be a fairly rational way of integra integrating the remote with the device it's controlling . # UI: concern about our market . # UI: , if we are I mean most of the of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control rationalisation . # UI: , you've got twenty different devices in your living room , you want one wo y you want one that'll do the job of all of them . # UI: , if all you're replacing is one of the you know however many remotes you have in your living room , you know you still need separate remotes for everything else . # UI: I just think that possibly # PM: this is a requirement that we have to stick to I'm afraid , this isn't one that I've just arbitrarily decided on . # PM: this is this is one of the solid ones that has to be obeyed , for now . # PM: I can understand your point , and I would agree with you , but this is our design spec for now . # UI: Does that would that include access to say interactive functions on digital or cable ? # PM: I would say so , yes , because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes , and that is a separate unit . # PM: I think that it I would say that the design spec we've been with is for the television only for now . # PM: And until we hear otherwise we should go with just that . # ME: Okay , specifically television . # PM: Maybe we'll hear differently , but for now # ME: So the joystick is just for differentness . # PM: It would be ease of manipulation of certain functions , yes . # UI: Just a thought . # UI: maybe then our market should be T_V_ manufacturers , rather than the public . # UI: Try and sell it t sell it to them to supply with # PM: There is that possibility , yes . # PM: However I don't know exactly where we'll be going with that , but it might not even be the avenue of the Marketing Expert , that might be sales , who are not in this meeting . # ME: It's just , the way I figure it , twelve point five Euros per unit , we have to sell at least like three million or something like that , not to account for all the money we waste on remotes that no one buys , you know , like if we made a perf if we made a ks for every remote we made someone bought it , then we have to sell a lot of remote controls . # ME: We just Is this gonna be enough to sell ? # PM: something else that you brought up was the ability to lose a remote , which as you said you've done , in fact we've probably all done . # PM: , I don't know if it's a gimmick or not , but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle , it will beep and you tell you where it is . # UI: Mm , I've seen them . # ME: I had one of those , and my brother , and my dad , could have beat me up because it went off all the time accidentally . # PM: other option of course is that the # ME: The clapping one . # PM: I was going to say clapping , digital telephones , for example , one unit has of course you have to have that base unit , somewhere where there's a button , but maybe it's a button that you attach to the T_V_ . # ME: To a television . # PM: Something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit . # UI: , I think that's a good idea . # PM: And that could be something could separate us a bit . # ME: , that's a good idea . # PM: And that way , because we're attaching what would be a small button to the T_V_ , again say what , it would be a small transmitter , watch battery type scenario I would say , or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just I don't power that might be something that we could look into . # PM: it's putting a lot on your shoulders there , so I mean that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well . # PM: To go on from here . # PM: we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote . # PM: Before we leave this meeting , it would be best to say this is what we're going this is the design we're gonna try and get , this is how we're gonna make ourselves look unique . # PM: Do we go for maybe a remote contro we're gonna go for a remote control obviously , do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels , up and down , and then , what , another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the L_C_D_ . # UI: I think that's # ID: We're just saying volume . # ID: Should volume be important in the joystick , do you think ? # PM: We could use say the left and right for changing channels and the up and down for volume , # ME: But we have a frequency of how what people use a remote control for most . # ME: power is used like once per hour , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight per hour , that's by far the biggest one , and then teletext , is still here , that's like fourteen , # PM: Vol Volume selection okay , yep , # ME: and volume selection . # PM: the teletext we're gambling with , and we're gonna say it's dead , the way of the dodo # PM: we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , L_C_D_ , and then what maybe is it one more button to say that you're using the menu system , and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay ? # PM: So we're having very few buttons involved , # UI: Actually how # PM: but navigation around a menu for most things . # UI: Actually I would say maybe two function buttons , the y we're now using the menus button and an og and an okay button . # UI: I mean certainly something I've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay . # UI: Or vice versa . # UI: And that's really irritating . # UI: The o the o the other dis design constraint I think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly , so we need to make sure that e even with the joystick , you know something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand and have the joystick just controlled by the thumb . # PM: we're actually that sounds like a rough idea . # PM: Do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise ? # PM: Do you mind looking ? # ME: , I think because it's so small it might be an I mean if we only have like two three buttons it might be essential to have to have that # PM: The ability to locate it again . # PM: So that would require a transmitter maybe attached to the T_V_ , just so that it says find me , and what , a basically a small microphone on the actual unit , can maybe hide it in the base . # ID: Light bulb as well , # UI: Oh . So so a small speaker you mean . # PM: Some speaker , # ID: And a light bulb ? # ID: you'd see it anyway , if you hear it . # PM: we might be better with the sound possibly we could maybe incorporate # ME: those little key-rings have both , # PM: th e the true fact , considering the cost of an L_E_D_ , we could just incorporate it anyway . # PM: The L_E_D_s can be surprisingly bright now . # UI: Blue ones particularly . # UI: Plus that's a nice wee design touch . # PM: by the sounds of it , with what we're suggesting so far , your design the user interface is still quite open , you could go for quite an interesting design . # PM: Because we're only going to have a very few key and you've got you know a small L_C_D_ , joystick , I think it leaves you open to a potential wide range of shapes , something that can make it stand out slightly . # PM: if you could look into what we've suggested so far , the feasibility of small transmitter , and such , maybe if an L_C_D_ screen requires too much power , or such . # PM: Ebenezer , Marketing Expert # ME: I can give you the frequency , what people what options people use most often , I guess that's gonna be important in the ts defining the software side of the interface , You want the stuff . # PM: if you could maybe as well see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we've taken , where of a joystick to control the very basic functions , and then the idea of manipulating it like you would a mobile . # PM: I don't know how easy that will be within the time frame , but could be something we could maybe look into . # PM: any last comments that anybody would like to put forward ? # PM: Anything that they think has been missed out . # PM: Bit of a wide open question there of course . # PM: Feel free to email me if you think that we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible . # ID: I should just look at the speaker , the speaker and an L_E_D_ . # PM: Speaker and L_E_D_ for locating , # ME: Transmitter . # ID: and a transmitter . # UI: Actually one wee thought about that . # UI: , if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the then the transmitter could actually be built into the television . # PM: getting the external power source , yep , that's quite true . # PM: , and something that we can easily be adopted at the last minute as well I'd say . # PM: The electronics could be s either placed externally or internally , makes no difference to the final product of the actual remote control , so that's good . # UI: You know I think I mean if it w if we get a major television manufacturer to say y oh we'll have that , save us the bother , then that's you know vast amounts of sales . Quite quickly . # PM: one thing that we've almost not talked about at all , my apologies for that , user interface , we also need to maybe get the slogan in here , # PM: I'm pointing at my laptop , what in God Real reaction , and such . # ID: The slogan is # ID: the slogan's we put the fashion in electronics , isn't it ? # PM: My apologies . # PM: it could well be , I've probably missed that . # PM: , I think that's l almost the last minute thing # ID: 'S also look cool . # PM: we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top . # PM: So I'm not too concerned a that we haven't gone into depth about that . # PM: But it might be something you could consider when you're thinking about shapes ? # PM: In fact we might like to put a slogan on , and possibly the two R_s to signify the company . Rather than real reaction . # UI: I thought the d the double arc could perhaps be the enter button . # PM: And I'd say that that's us for now .
# PM: Okay so we'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes . # PM: I think to sum up the last meeting , would be to say the requirements that we've set out . # PM: Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on a small joystick , L_C_D_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation with power being I suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . # PM: we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . # PM: that pretty much sums up the last one . # PM: we'll just crack on , like to maybe start with the Industrial Designer if it's possible . # PM: the con today is the concep today . # PM: This meeting is the conceptual design phase Sorry about this . # PM: And is to cover things like what the parts might be made of , can we outsource these from elsewhere , will we have to construct any items ourselves ? # ID: I have a presentation I just saved it in the folder . # PM: I'll just I'll load it up then . # PM: Which one do y interface concept ? # PM: We've got trend watching , that's you . # ID: Components design . # PM: Components design . # ID: The case le that's what I wrote first of all , could be plastic our plastic . # ID: but later on we found out that it can be rubber as well , or titanium or even wood . # ID: we decide what it's gonna be . # ID: Probably plastic . # ID: we need the infra-red transmitter . # ID: Get that off the shelf . # ID: joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it , could be plastic w or rubber even as well . # ID: if you go on to the next slide . # ID: If you go on to f findings , it's like two or three slides down . # ID: Right . So , this is what I found we can use . # ID: three different types of batteries . can either use a hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , you know that they use in watches , or else a solar powered one . # PM: the kinetic one , we've 'cause that's the ones where like you the movement causes it . # PM: the bat the battery for a watch wouldn't require a lot of power , would be my one query . # PM: Is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power ? # UI: There's also a watch moves around a great deal more . # ID: I don't think it would . # ID: And solar cells , I dunno about that . # ID: We should probably just use conventional batteries . , just like in usual remote controls . # PM: Which I suppose as well would allow us to go off the shelf again , you'd say ? # ID: And these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have . # ID: one is a flat one , and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved . # ID: the materials are tha there as you can see , but you can't have a titanium one for a double curved , # ME: Titanium , the really strong metal , titanium ? # ID: which would be # ME: Is it not also it's expensive ? # ID: , i think so as well , . # ID: They make mountain bikes out of that , don't they . # ID: So it's really light as well . # PM: , I don't know if you'd be able to off the top of your head or not , the single curved and double curved , would you be able to give an example ? # PM: could you maybe draw something ? # PM: I you don't doesn't have to be perfect , it's just 'cause I'm not quite sure if I understand the difference between the two . # ID: for a curved , well I was thinking to f for to sit in your the palm of your hand . # ID: maybe like this , with the joy pad here . Joystick here . And maybe an okay button around here , so that the thumb can use it quite easily . # ID: I don't exactly Double curved . It probably means this is probably double curved . # ID: whereas a single curved would be like that . # ID: I guess . Or not necessarily . # PM: So it might literally just be # ID: Whereas this is two curves . # ID: so I guess that's what they mean by double curve . # ID: which obviously it looks better than the single curve , but you can't have it in titanium , which is a nice material . # ID: and for the buttons , it can have the scroll wheel which they use in mouses for com P_C_s . # ID: but it requires a more expensive chip to use , and if you wanna use L_C_D_ it's even more expensive . # ID: you have to decide , there's trade-offs there . # ID: if you want the buttons to be if you have a double curve control and it's rubber , then you have these rubber buttons as well . # ID: But you're gonna ha I reckon you're gonna have to have key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days . # ID: You wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want . # ID: You wanna enter just the number of it , if you know it . # ID: I reckon we're gonna have to have a number keypad anyway . # PM: that was definitely something we can talk about . # PM: you've got a little bit about the chip that we might require as well ? # ID: depends where gonna spend the money if you want the f fancy L_C_D_ display . # PM: , do you have any idea so far , like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an L_C_D_ , does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount ? Or ? # ME: Need an advanced chip for the L_C_D_ . # PM: I think compared to say just pressing buttons . # ME: Advanced , like three eight six advance . # PM: if you press a button that sends a certain transmission through the infra-red , whereas I think if we're controlling the L_C_D_ we definitely require a much more powerful chip . # PM: Just compared to the chip you would use for pushing buttons I think is the point being made . # PM: If I've not over-stepped . # PM: should I go on , or go back ? # ME: Mm , if we only have twelve Pounds fifty , twelve Euros , not even twelve Pounds . # ME: Twelve Euros , what's that , like eight pounds or something like that , nine Pounds ? # PM: we'd also be relying on the bulk buying in producement and such . I assume . # ME: that's good point . # PM: We have to look into the costs of those . # ID: the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the remote control . # ID: If you go to the one before that it just says what it does , translate the key press into an infra-red signal and this is received by the T_V_ . # ID: the chip just needs to detect the signal or detect the key press and then it'll send it to the tr the amplifier . # ID: And then the next slide just shows how the copper wires interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons , to get sent to the chip . # ID: that's just how the control works inside . # ID: we have to decide on what buttons we're gonna use . # PM: in the information that you've been supplied , how feasible would you say that the idea of using an L_C_D_ looks ? # ID: I think we can do it if we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic . # ID: and then maybe use single curved case . # ID: Because we might need it to be curved for the thumb to use the joyst joystick easily . # ID: and then you'll need the advanced chip obviously for the L_C_D_ . # PM: I mean that sounds like quite a good requirement to me . # PM: conventional battery would seem to make sense . # PM: I'm not sure if there's any cost differences between single and double curved I don't know about anybody else , but plastic or rubber as a traditional form of casing would seem to be a good way forward ? . # UI: I'm actually gonna be bold and go oo go straight for rubber for reasons I'll go into in more detail . # ME: I also have a preference for rubber . # ME: Based on my research . # PM: will we move on to user interface , as long as were you ? # ID: Yep I'm finished . # PM: and d interface concept . # UI: Now I'm gonna have to work between the slides and the and the white board 'cause I actually I have some fairly concrete things this time . # UI: I was given a an H_T_M_L_ file giving various ideas from other previous remote control designs , and pretty much decided to just dump them all . # UI: I wasn't very impressed by them and they didn't seem to re nothing I saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today . # UI: what I ra rather than looking at other remotes , ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand . # UI: and try and f and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on , so that if r a if so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already . # UI: next slide , if you please . # UI: and what we've basically decided on was the joy the joystick , two function buttons and the L_C_D_ , just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum . # UI: I don't actually think we need the numeric keypad because if you m because one of the menus that we could have available v via the L_C_D_ is one where you scroll through channels , so if there's something f and be bear in mind since this isn't meant to work for # UI: f for di for digital or for or for cable , whatever , you're basically looking at four or five terrestrial channels , and then your V_C_ and then the channel through your V_C_R_ and or D_V_D_ player . And or box . # UI: So it's not I'm not really excessively concerned about that . # UI: You must have two modes , basic mode , where the joystick's left right left right for channels , up down for volume , and the uh and the menu mode for further functions . # UI: now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design , it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people . # PM: Can I just jump in slightly there ? # PM: That would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate , then . # UI: Yes , absolutely . # UI: , basi basically what I basically what the what be having , I would say , the whole thing articulated at two points , so that if you if you're handing it from a lef left or right handed user you can adjust it so that the L_C_ the L_C_D_ and the The joystick would be in the right place . # UI: And also this is a rather nicer de design gimmick that the you know the whole thing you know it should have sort of organic feel to it that it should be , you know , soft to touch can be moved around all nice . # UI: on to on to the next to the next slide . # PM: Just to let you know we'll probably be quite tight for time as well , because I think you've probably got a lot you'd like to say , I guess . # UI: 'kay basically I can add pretty pictures to this . # UI: Assuming the hand the hand to be in about sort of this position , hol holding the remote , the joystick unit should rest over the joint of the f of the four finger so that it's directly accessible for the thumb . # UI: and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for left or right handed users . # UI: You then have a grip section that can be more or less the same irrespective of handedness . # UI: You just have big two big buttons that cover most of the area so it can in the upper part , one for the four finger , one for the middle finger . # ME: Is this the joystick ? # UI: Th this part here is the joystick . # UI: This would be the actual grip . # UI: Probably where you'd want to have the battery as well . # UI: That would be probably the bulkiest part . # UI: And you then have , at the at the bottom , the L_C_D_ , and this would need to be articulated as well . # UI: And basically I'd want this to rest here , right at the base of the wrist . # UI: So it would fit just nicely in the hand . # UI: And again , this part could be rotated , so it can So so that it can be adjusted to either left or right handed user . # UI: the t the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button . # UI: And then the bottom function buttons switches between modes . # UI: programming it actually thi this is one thing I've found with the replacement remote control . # UI: Programming them can be a right pain . # UI: So I thought th the simplest way around that would be to have a cable to connect it to the computer some fair iv fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer just so that you could pr program it at a rather in a rather more comfortable interface . # UI: And you could download programs for it from for T_V_s from all sort of main manufacturers . # UI: though you i it would be necessary to have a m have a ha have a mode for programming it without the computer , just in case there are there are still people left out there who don't have them yet . # UI: That's that's my idea . # PM: Excellent , File open . # PM: Trend watching . # ME: to gather my research , two basic methods . # ME: We compared whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool . # ME: And then we research fashion trends in Europe , what's the new black , you know , as it goes . # ME: Next slide please . # ME: we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to be cool . # ME: As in they want it to do a lot of good s they want it to look like it does a lot , and if it does do a lot that's a bonus , but they don't care so much , you know . # ME: They want it to be that's sounds a bit like a contradiction . # ME: Technology technical technologically innovative . People want it to be that , but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does . # ME: like the interface is really important . # ME: And easy to use , it just so happens that from the second point to the third point is twice as important I mean the second point is twice as important as the third point . # ME: People want it I is it has to be cooler than easy to use , you know , if it has the newest features , even if it's difficult to use , prefer it to have the newest features . # ME: And if it's easy to use that's a bonus . # ME: The fashion , now this is seems a bit odd to me , but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes . # ME: How that relates to a remote control I don't know . # ME: But I see I come on to that in the next in the next slide . # ME: I've als I've been saying everything's the new black . # ME: spongy's the new black as well . # ME: we have the choice between rubber and plastic . # ME: If it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze , you know , it's spongy , then can I skip the rest ? # ID: I forgot to mention that . # ID: The rubber material is the type of stress ball material , not just normal rubber . # ID: Forgot to say that . # ME: kinda spongy material . # ME: my personal opinion ? # ME: we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative , obviously . # ME: But what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future that looks cool , that's different , you know , everyone has a white remote control , black remote control , you need something cool . # ME: Like , titanium is cool but it's expensive . # ME: And maybe it's a bit of overkill for a remote control . # ME: now the fruit and veg options , either we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it . # ME: I mean the research did come up with fruit and veg , so maybe it is important it's the up to the interface guy . # ME: if we stay away from it , s you know stay away from it , but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that , or a kiwi fruit . # ME: It could be something like , I say potato peeler but I'm sure you guys have a have a much cooler idea than I do . # ME: I think cool is the key . # ME: Few questions about a spongy remote control . # ME: I've never seen one before . # ME: I've seen plastic remote controls . # ME: I think maybe they were I don't know , back in the day when they first came up with remote controls , they had a reason for it being sturdy , you know . For being strong and sturdy . # ME: if we want something strong and sturdy , I say stay with plastic or titanium , but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want , it doesn't matter , it's spongy material , it's not gonna break , you know . # ME: I just don't know how the L_E_D_ and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material because it's not gonna be completely squeezable . # ME: how do things fit it ? # ME: And if we are gonna use spongy , we can say it's long lasting , you know it's damage resistant and stuff like that , just to summarise , people want stuff that's cool , that's that looks like it's cool , and if it is cool then that's a bonus doesn't have to be people like fruit and veg . # ME: We can either go down that alley or stay totally away from it . # ME: People like spongy material . # ME: If we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is , and how we can further promote that idea . # ME: And also , this was this year . # ME: things change all the time , every year you know they always talk about this year , this is the new black . # ME: next year something else is gonna be the new black and we're stuck with last year's fruit and veg type stuff . # PM: I would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year's lead on most people anyway . # PM: You always have to bring out new designs , so if we can get next year then that's possibly a good place to start anyway . # PM: Seems like a lot of the components could be off the shelf , I don't exactly what cost would be incurred . # PM: I can see your point about the number keypad , but I've I would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system if you need to do traversal of a large number of channels . # PM: My feeling would be that even if at a later date this was to be taking control of boxes as well having the use of the L_C_D_ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers for you to be # UI: , actually if you've got a lot of channels , the number keypad can be quite annoying as well , becau it's you know if you're trying to remember what , you know , what number's the discovery channel or whatever . It's just irritating . # ME: That's a good point . # UI: But if you h but if you have a me but if you have a menu structure , then you can sub-group them . # ME: You can incorporate names into the menu . # ME: Even news , music . Like they do on sky digital kinda . # PM: what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components , say something like lithium ion battery , the kind that you find in most small hand held devices now . # PM: Looks like we going for a double curved design . # PM: I don't know what cost implications there are in that . # PM: , looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber . # PM: Though I'd have to say depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some kind of inner frame . # UI: I would say definitely , I mean I mean I mean the idea of having it sort of articulated i th there would be basically two points of articulation . W one below and one above the m the main sort of grip . # PM: Do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation ? # PM: I can see why it looks appealing , but it could be a weak point in the structure , do you think ? # PM: That would be a worry of mine . # ID: If you're going with the fruit and veg thing , looks like a banana . # UI: I d I don't thi I don't think that it would be a structural weakness , # ID: F if you wanna design it that way . # UI: I mean if you have a firm s sub-structure , you can then incorporate articulation into that . # UI: If you then have a sort of outer skin of mm flexible , spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know organic , and I think would look rather co I mean mi rather cool . # UI: I mean my drawing there doesn't do it justice , it makes it makes it look more a little bit more like a vibrator than a than a than a remote control , # PM: we won't add that functionality . # ME: Okay . Course not . # PM: However , one interesting point is , I don't know how serious you were there , if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ? # PM: It's an certainly a different colour from your average # UI: Make it harder to lose , as well . # PM: Was there anything in your research # ME: The noise for when you lose the banana , f , for when you lose the remote control , it could be like a monkey noise or something like that , rather than a standard beep . # ME: Y you know , you lose the monkey the banana , # ME: y you lose the banana , you press a button , and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana . # UI: I th I mean if it I think that's something that could perhaps be programmable , though maybe have monkey as default . # ME: I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control . # ME: Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s , you know you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that works with your particular television . # ME: But why you'd need to program it like as a standard feature , I don't know . # UI: Well basi basically the for f for e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that the T_V_ responds to . # UI: It's not simply a matter of frequency . # UI: usually what's done is you have this big booklet full of different possi you'll have all of them sort of programmed in to the remote , and you'll have this little booklet of codes you then find your ma find your manufacturer and try the different codes come under that manufacturer's name 'til you find the right one . # ME: That's because televisions , they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it . # UI: that's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that . # UI: But if we had some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing . # PM: An interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer , we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes , maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the L_C_D_ and then they maybe look up different names of different actual units that have been produced . # PM: Or we have the remote control just go through them until it's like does this do the correct function , and such . # ME: Is it is it actually a book of names to digits , or is it like a few pages ? # UI: booklet . Some pages . # ME: I was just thinking , if we were to store this information , some type of mapping . # ME: This person probably need to use this feature like once , you know , when you first buy the remote control , or whenever they buy a new television , # PM: Doesn't have to be used very often # UI: But it's a but it's a nuisance . # UI: And it's a nuisance very close to the to actually purchasing it , so it's something that you're likely to be thinking about . # UI: If you if there's w i if there's one in the shop that's that says it can avoid much of that nuisance , you might be favourably inclined towards it . mm . # PM: just to give us a rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage . # PM: I'm pretty sure that you got that anyway . # PM: This is the conceptual one . # PM: I think we've come up I think we've covered everything we need to here . # PM: I think we've decided on what , you know , decided on standard items for most of rubber and such , we're now looking at the detailed design and what we need to be doing for the next meeting . # PM: So for example , I'll just start at the top , you've got yourself and the Industrial Designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage 'cause it'll be hard not to , obviously . # PM: looking from prototyping of some des description using clay . # PM: I suppose you'll be told a lot more about that as progress . # PM: The user interface design , They're kind of it looks they're the idea I've pushed forward so far is maybe more of a physical one there , whereas possibly be more interested in maybe how the L_C_D_'s going to incorporate , do you think ? # PM: Or do you s perceive that most the design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout ? # UI: I think other than ge getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it , mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are made , I would say . # UI: but then again , the menu structure to a considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television , and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate . # UI: and one of the nice things about having an L_C_D_ and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it . # PM: , that's very true . # PM: got product evaluation as well . # ME: you see I don't some of these things kinda logically follow the others . # ME: How can t product evaluation , doesn't that come after actually seen a product prototype . # PM: I think we'd be it'd be more a case of how do we envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have a model to test with . # ME: Oh , that's the okay , sure . # PM: it'd be a case of do you think that just bringing users in to have them test it out , maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places which I suppose is quite similar . # PM: Or just kind of hitting the streets and you know saying this is a new remote control , what do you think of the look of it ? # ME: At this stage we still have no target audience # PM: I think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say maybe sixty or something ludicrous . # PM: the reason I'm saying that is we're just looking at a replacement remote control , something that's stylish , so maybe you're even just maybe you're narrowing down your target audience simply by saying # ME: And it's stylish . # PM: if they're buying it that often or they're maybe looking to replace something then , they've got a bit of free cash , so that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket . # PM: Maybe even single , just for the reasons of excess cash flow . # PM: Although of course I mean at twenty five Euros , I don't think we're looking at charging the earth for the device . # PM: Think that's well within the normal bracket . # PM: your idea of the U_S_B_ would I think would largely depend on the cost . # PM: U_S_B_'s definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there , but it might push the cost of the overall unit up 'cause it would require not just the connection but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system . # PM: That one might have to be based on # ME: Programmable memory as well . # ID: The U_S_B_ for which ? # ME: For the remote control . # PM: The the idea was that maybe it could connect up for allowing a software interface on the P_C_ for a larger programming # ID: Oh right , okay . # PM: due to the fact that we've gone for such a nice , easy minimal design , normally . # ME: We've w definitely talking some type of # ID: But didn't they just say it's just for T_V_ , or are we gonna # PM: It's just for T_V_ , but for # PM: programming it to use your T_V_ , you might hook it up to the P_C_ . # PM: I'm not sure , but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the U_S_B_ might be prohibitive . # PM: We don't know unless it would make sense to . # ME: But you're gonna need some type of flash memory or something . # ME: something that doesn't you wouldn't have to redo the whole thing once the batteries are changed , you know , once you turn off the power . # UI: The other thing I mean it I mean it would need to ha it would need to have some sort of on board memory anyway . # UI: f for one for one thing because I do think that the menu system should be I mean although you know , it's not going to be terribly complicated if it's just controlling one device , the menu system ought to be o ought to be customisable # ME: Different languages , different skins and stuff like that . # UI: How how you want say the menu structure for flicking through channels if you've got lots of channels . That sort of thing . # ME: I if it was customisable as in different languages and stuff , that does open it is supposed to be international , # PM: It would make sense to . I would say to . # ME: It would make sense if you could # PM: and we'd better be careful about the time as well . # PM: We've already had the five minute warning , I would say . # PM: International would make sense . # PM: you're gonna look at product evaluation . # PM: I'd better start writing up a hell of a lot of crap . # PM: you're gonna look a bit more at the kind of the physical make up you say . # PM: looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay . # PM: we'll see how that goes . # UI: Are we going to be supplied with the clay is what I want to know . # UI: Where is the clay ? # PM: I think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting , would you say ? # ID: they're going with the fashion thing , like the design , spongy rubber . # ME: The fruit and veg . # UI: Mm . I th I think I would largely want to actually steer clear of the whole sort of fruit and veg thing . # PM: , I would s that would be my feeling . # UI: Bu but the spongy idea I like . I like it a lot . # PM: We seem to have quite a general consensus that the idea of the r rubber could be quite # UI: I having it i having it sort of br bright yellow I think that's quite a good idea , though maybe we could have options for colours as well . # UI: and again this has the advantage of being harder to lose . # ME: I mean we are trying to promote a remote control , but we wanna keep the company brand as well , # PM: So we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on . # PM: Possibly I'm think I'm not sure but I'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used . # UI: I was like I said before I think we should have the R_R_ on the on the top function button . # PM: And I think that says it all really . # ME: I think so too . # PM: See everybody in a half hour .
# PM: That should hopefully do the trick , . # PM: Sorry about the small delay . # PM: Falling a little bit behind schedule . # PM: And that's fifteen twenty five . # PM: Okay . So just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one , we're gonna go for something uh how was it ? # PM: The new black , I believe . # PM: something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , of course . # PM: many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an L_C_D_ display . # PM: other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . # PM: Okay . So due to your hard work , we might as well let the two designers go first , and show us the prototype . # PM: Quite how the best way to do this is , I'm not sure , # UI: I think if we both step up and outline our ideas . # UI: Okay . Now do doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . # UI: for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is h i is down here for the L_E_D_ . # UI: As it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the function buttons and joystick , though it might be an idea to be able to a adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit ju just a thought . # UI: You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn twisted round , so that the sticky so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other . # UI: But as you as you see with the with holding it in the left hand , the L_ the L_C_D_ is nowhere useful , so that would need to be articulated if we're going to retain ergonomic design . # UI: I got your note about keeping the cost down . # PM: We'll go into that a bit more , # UI: this design could be done with plastic casing . # PM: but please go on . # UI: Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as well . # UI: As for the as for the single curve , well this edge and this edge , like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it , but it's not absolutely necessary . # UI: Really the curve that's most needed is the underside so that the jo so that the joystick rests over the edge of the hand like this . # UI: and you have the transmitter here and a wee speaker for the for the for the fi for the remote control finder . # UI: Any further comments ? # ID: obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks , because it's gonna be flat on one side , so the L_C_D_ will be s sticking down like this , won't it ? # ID: 'Cause it you can't get it curved . # ID: because of costs . # ID: And it's plastic as well , so it won't be as comfortable on the hand . # UI: I mean with the with the rubber design it could i you know it could pretty much mould very much to the to the user's hand . # UI: One nice wee feature if we could if we could still do the rubber , I though of was to have the rubber extend beyond the end of the of the rigid substructure . # UI: So it has a wee sort of tail that you just drape over your wrist so it stays in position nicely . # ME: I've got a if you load up my evaluation document . # PM: Excellent work . # ME: Basic point have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by . # ME: then we will it's a seven s seven step kinda evaluation process . # ME: not seven steps , seven scale . # ME: after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria , we average that and that will give us some type of confidence in our prototype . # ME: And the criteria based on Real Reactions' kinda goals and policies , marketing strategies , and also those I put together from the user requirements phase . # ME: if you flip the those are the criteria . # ME: And perhaps I could have put 'em a bit better , but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned , which means that the product will score very badly on some of those points . # ME: Put it mildly . # ME: One , t Seven , eight , oh . Fourth . # ME: Okay , so we have to go through each point . # ME: If we imagine it's actually straight , and just give it a score . # ME: how well would you say the prototype is how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from being lost , or to be able to find them once they are lost . # ME: I mean , is the homing thing still the locator , is that still # UI: , that's still part of the design . # ME: And Adam , we can keep that in ? # PM: I mean I don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost , 'cause that would mean doing something about the human element , but I'd like to think that we've done something about finding the damn thing once we have . # UI: Mm . And making it a bright colour helps with the personally I would have gone for purple . # ME: Mm . Bright colour . # ME: we still have that noise thing , on a scale of one to seven , how would you guys rate it for finding it once it's lost ? # UI: I'd say number one . # ME: Number number one for the first criteria . # UI: I think w if it was just the sounder then th I mean something I've found with w with say tr trying to find a cordless phone or a m mobile , you can hear it , but you can't quite pin it dow pin down where it is . # ME: you can tell what room the mobile is # ID: What about what if the volume on the T_V_'s turned up massively and you just wanna turn down the volume can't find remote . # ID: Suppose you have to go to the T_V_ and do it manually . Mm . # ID: Like y you wouldn't hear the speaker . # PM: just before we go through all of the steps here , well what we'll do is # ME: You wanna say something ? # PM: if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate , and then we'll come back to the product evaluation if that's alright . # ME: Oh that's fine . # PM: is there anything here that you that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered ? # PM: And then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this . # ME: What do you mean cr is there anything I wanna # PM: I is there any of these criteria that need any explaining ? # PM: Or is there anything that yous thought tha really would stand out compared to the others ? # ME: Something I neglected from my initial research is that Real Reactions has a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion , and clothing fashion . # ME: That is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important and they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends in fashion . # ME: So they say we put the fashion in electronics , they really mean it they they're very big on fashion , That's this bit right here . # ME: And this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody ? # ME: I guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface , so it's kinda condensed into one . # ME: And we can come back to it , you said . # PM: and which we will do very shortly . # PM: Slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do . # PM: most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_ which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure because of course we required a chip as well . # PM: the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_ , at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface , require more buttons , etcetera . # PM: Or what we did was that we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure . # PM: changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the proposed costs and we're just scraping it in , we've got point two of a Euro left over there . # PM: So we're just managing it really . # PM: Even then as well , there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I've used what I think's appropriate . # PM: With any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to . # PM: It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side , for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now . # ME: Different languages ? # PM: That should still be viable . # PM: We've got an advanced chip , we've got the use of the L_C_D_ . # PM: So being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility . # PM: but what's something we need to decide on is how we're gonna go from here . # PM: We do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people if need be . # PM: I can bring the excel up sheet up and show you if you wish . # PM: I really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design , possibly meaning that the L_C_D_ wouldn't be in this perfect place . # PM: It might be s stuck like slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for a right handed person . # UI: I suppose o one thing that could be done is h is have it circular and have it s so that the pink actually goes a bit over the pinkie finger . Mm . # PM: It very much is about making concessions , unfortunately . # ME: Do you have any data on how much different prints cost ? # ME: I mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design ? # PM: b da is you mean on the plastic , or ? # PM: Let's have a look . # PM: You now have as much information as I do . # PM: as you can see here , for example , the battery really not very little choice in that one . # PM: We've gone for one of the cheaper options as well . # PM: Unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we're gonna do what we're needing to . # PM: I've said single curved . # PM: We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it . # PM: plastic for some reason incurs no cost , which I've had to very much make advantage of , despite the fact that rubber's only got a value of two Euros per unit . # PM: Problem comes here as you can see in the interface . # PM: if I've read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button . # PM: That might make sense , because then a numeric keypad would come in at what , four point five Euros , which is an awful lot , so that could well be wrong . # PM: Even if we save point five there , it would just mean that we're most likely placing it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit , which has had to be put to one side . # PM: As you can see , the use of an L_C_ display advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well because it's an integrated scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what I think they had in mind with a joystick . # ME: Why would why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together ? # ME: That's quite significantly expensive . # PM: that's something you'll have to take up with the bean counters . # PM: as you can see I mean that's taken up well over half of the price . # PM: I'm very much open to suggestions of where we go , but because we need to shed what was four Euros off of the price of for what we really desired , this one comes in under price as you can see , but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design . # ME: We don't even have speakers here . # ME: what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that ? Have we factored that in ? # PM: no , we haven't , not # ME: Transmitter , receiver , speakers . Plus the extra device itself that's gonna be on a T_V_ . # ME: Is that gonna be a button , or # PM: That'll it literally would just be a button . # PM: We might have to # ID: That's too expensive isn't it ? # PM: It looks like almost nothing good call , I missed that . # ME: I mean it's not on here , # PM: that's a very valid point . # ME: Did they s do we have to use an advanced chip for the L_C_D_ ? # PM: So if we're gonna go with the L_C_ display , then that's # ME: What's a hand dyna dynamo ? # ME: You have to wind it up ? # PM: That would probably not be in keeping with the fashion statement and such , # ID: So basically the only new thing is the L_C_D_ on the remote now . # PM: Being manipulated by the joystick , # ID: Oh , and joystick , # PM: Which I'm defining as scroll wheel . # ME: And we couldn't replace the joystick , Because we would need four extra buttons to replace it , up down left and right , and that would be more expensive but is a scroll wheel not just back and forward ? # PM: it's just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be , that that's what I've labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation . # ID: The L_C_D_ basically is the big selling point of # PM: If we remove the L_C_ display , we could save ourselves # PM: a fair amount . # PM: Which you could # ID: But that's what makes it original though , # UI: Mm . I think if we remove the L_C_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings # UI: and we just we could just put our branding on any other remote control . # PM: We should possibly have If we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to . # ME: Does this does this bear in mind that I mean it's a bit ridiculous that they're gonna charge us what is it , like this much money for three million if we're gonna buy three million components , # PM: Again , you'll have to argue with the accountants on that one . # PM: but for the purposes of this meeting , I'm we're gonna have to stick with these figures . # PM: I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display 'cause it's about what really separates us , despite the cost it's gonna incur . # PM: are people maybe not happy with , but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case , to keep the L_C_D_ ? # UI: one thing , I mean ho how much extra would it be to keep I mean keep the articulation ? # PM: It's hard to tell . # PM: I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved , # UI: This is what I'm wondering . # PM: and even then I'm not quite sure if that's incorporating the idea of articulation . # UI: no , I think I it d that it needn't require it to be double curved . # ID: It can be s it can still be single curved , # UI: It's it's just it's just it's just that the case would come in t would be made in two parts and then joined together with an articulation . # PM: Single curved with articulation ? # ME: Could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface ? # ME: 'Cause like we do we have re restrictions on software ? # ID: That's what we need for the joystick I think though . # ME: but there has to be # UI: and I mean the I mean if you look if you look closer at the at the prototype here , the lines here along the grip are actually quite straight . # PM: But the curves all o over hand , # UI: on the on the L_C_D_ I mean although we've done it with a curve it could just as easily be done without curves . # UI: The curve that's really needed is up here , # UI: to put to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position for it to have it rest on the top of the hand . # PM: We wouldn't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway , so I mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation . # PM: unless we hear otherwise we could go ahead with that proposal . # ME: I think the product is not gonna perform so well for my criteria . # PM: Which is what we can get onto now . # PM: As long as so are we gonna say w we have to keep an eye on the time as well , but we're gonna say single curved design # ME: wait a minute . # ME: Sample speaker ? What is a sample speaker ? # ME: Is that somewhat similar to what we want ? # PM: It could well be , but at a cost of # UI: that's that voice response thing that we got the email about . # UI: But I thought it was just completely pointless . # ME: You got a email about voice response ? # UI: B i basically it was saying that our labs had come up with a chip that you could , you know , say hello to , and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice . # PM: we'll definitely won't go with that one . # ME: We won't go with that one , did you say ? # PM: that's voice recognition , so . # ME: I mean I we Okay , okay . # PM: . So , okay , battery definitely , # ME: it looks like we're gonna get rid of the whole loca locator thing . # PM: It looks like it unless we can manage to put it in under point two Euros , . # PM: Maybe even slight oh , pretty much point two Euros , I'd say . # PM: So we'll leave that one for now . # PM: we'll just have # ID: Are we going for a special colour at all ? # PM: It's a case of I'm slightly unsure . # PM: One point five of a Euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right . # PM: So maybe it's a case of a push button is maybe one or more . # PM: At which point if # ID: I was for a case . # ID: Or had you already incorporated that ? # ME: Oh , special colour for the case . # PM: you got point five there . # PM: It's literally a case of whether or not this is correct . # PM: I'm not quite sure if they're I don't think they mean point five Euros per button . # UI: Okay , well l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case and then we at least have make it a little harder to lose . # UI: Because most m most remotes are a fairly dingy colour that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap in a living room . # ME: W what's the default colour ? # ME: White or black ? # PM: Black's probably the normal colour you'd say , # PM: I quite like that colour that you're fetching there , # PM: it's definitely for make it glow in the dark even better . # PM: will we go with that then ? # PM: It's not and we can see we'll come back to your evaluation which you're probably now going to pan us but there we go . # PM: Just to give you an idea , you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well , I'm not sure how much time . # PM: We've not hit the five minute mark warning yet , # ME: Right okay . Okay . # ID: Think it's ten minutes left . # ME: Ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost . # ID: Special colour . # ME: Special colour . # UI: Three . I think we can do three . # ME: Three if we're being generous , I feel . # UI: Th the special colour doesn't would I think make a difference . # ME: Think we're being generous here with three . # UI: It makes it stand out you know it's lost in a big pile of crap , it stands out from the rest of the crap . # ME: Reduce the number of unused buttons . # ME: We're down to t two buttons , # UI: Two buttons and a joystick . # ME: so that's a one . # PM: I'd say we're doing well there . # ME: that was good . # ME: Easy to use interface , buttons menu , menus that's good . # ME: we're not doing so badly . # ME: easy to use oh okay , let's forget that one . # ME: Fancy looking . # PM: As he models the # UI: It doesn't get much fancier . # ME: And we could do whatever we like with the L_ L_C_D_ . # ME: let's just assume it's a good L_C_D_ display . # ME: Maybe I was panicking for no reason . # ID: Are we going one on ? # ID: I'd say we go two , 'cause like f the fanciest would be the double curved . # ME: maybe you'd be a bit too . There we go . , # ID: With the articulators . With bells on it . # ME: that's m that's better too . More accurate numbers . # ME: Technologically innovative . # ME: we're getting rid of the locator thing # PM: Which is a shame . # UI: Mm . I'd give it a three for this for that . # ID: No need for teletext . # UI: I mean the menus thing is something you don't normally see on a remote , but you see it in a lot of other places . # ME: mobile phones . # ME: And y what you're doing is moving the menu from the television to the remote control , You say three ? # ME: I might go as far as two on that . # UI: I'd give it a three . # PM: I'd be tempted with three , . # PM: We'll get panned on the next one , anyway . # ME: Materials that people find pleasing . # ME: Sponginess is what they really would have wanted , apparently . # PM: Don't blame them . # PM: because of the way that we've minimalised the number of buttons and such . # PM: Plastic , it sucks . # PM: But it's no worse than any of the other pl remote controls we have . # ME: It's not a step backwards . # UI: I'd s I I'd give it a six , to be honest . # ME: , okay let's give it a six . # ME: that's totally thrown everything off balance . # ME: Inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion . # ME: What colour were we gonna make it ? # ID: Put a leopard print on it . # UI: I would sa I would say give a s give a selection of colours . # UI: we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype 'cause we had yellow . # UI: If I were buying one , I'd go for purple . # UI: Leopard print would be cool . # ME: But by this I think it's more a case of fruit and veg , # ID: I'd say the colour of the border there world you'd find that , that's that'd stand out . # PM: Like yellow , It would also help keep the product placement # PM: Is it inspired by clothing fashion ? # ME: But Th th they're referring to the fruit and veg thing . # ME: Is this like a banana type colour ? # ME: Could we stretch no still , it's not shaped like a banana is # UI: That's kinda i # UI: it won't be when it's been # ME: is that 'cause it's flat ? # ME: What is what fruit or veg is flat ? # UI: I think s I think this isn't not particularly fruit and veggie . # ME: Or we might have to suffer badly for this one as well . # ID: Yellow courgette . # PM: I mean it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg , so , what , four ? # ME: Oh that's it's very ambitious , # PM: Is that being too generous ? # UI: Mm . I'd I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion . Is the sole criterion for being fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions . # UI: I'd g I'd rate I'd rate this fairly highly from that point of view actually . # ID: this what we're gonna t this is their motto , like . # ID: And we're not doing well on it . # ME: This is their strategy . # ME: I m imagine we actually had some money invested in this and the amount that we invest is gonna be proportional to the marks . # ME: Might we might wanna be a bit more skepible sceptical about this one . # PM: What would you think yourself ? # ME: I would say I mean it's not at all , right ? In any way or shape or form . # PM: it's kind of curved # PM: and we can make it yellow , and that's pretty much banana like . # ME: Okay , the yellow banana like thing is I think is okay . # PM: it's got a curve to it . # ME: Is that sound reasonable ? # PM: do you think I'm stretching the use of the banana ? # ID: , I'll go with five . # ME: we have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven . # ME: So five , seven , ten , sixteen , twenty one . # ME: Which gives us an average of three . # ME: this would be in the middle . # ME: It's in the good section . # PM: It's not bad and considering the don't pick the pen . # ME: Sorry . I'm sorry . # PM: oh and you've knocked batteries out . # ID: 'S bad design , that thing . # PM: considering the price we had to get this in , to have a positive you know , even based on the four of us being heavily biased , it was gonna be quite hard to get anything standing out I'd say possibly , based on the cost features . # ME: Even if we were to increase this entire thing by seven , we were to go down a grade to four , we would have to do I mean we didn't we weren't that kinda optimistic too optim overly optimistic . # ME: You know like we didn't we didn't add we didn't subtract a whole seven points from these things , so I think we're definitely on the good bit . # ME: Even if we gave this one seven and this one seven , that's still only three extra points over seven . # UI: Mm . Personally , I think given that the product only replaces a single remote control # ME: we did it w it was okay . It was good . # UI: that you've already got , are people really gonna shell out twenty five Euros for something that's only marginally good ? # ID: it depends who your who's what the target people are , like you'd say maybe the fashion conscious # PM: Maybe it's been targeted # ID: women would be going , oh look at that , it looks like a yellow , looks like a banana , it's cool it's gotta look good in the sitting room . # PM: Hide it in the fruit basket . # ID: Rather than the L_C_D_ whereas more technical like more people in with the latest technology it's good , it's got an L_C_D_ screen 's only got two buttons and a joystick . # ID: which kind of people would be more likely to buy it ? # PM: Probably the people technologically . # PM: They're usually the ones that buy pointless stuff . # ME: I mean my mum still has not learnt how to use text messaging on her phone , and she's had it for a long time , you know . # ME: She uses it to make phone calls and that's it . # ME: I think if sh if my mum saw a remote control like this with only two buttons and a joystick , I mean that'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy , you know . # ME: She'd be like is this a remote control , how do you use it , and stuff like that . # ME: So even if it is really user friendly to us , but we're used to using menus all the time . # UI: I s I suppose one thing is that b because it's technically innovative , for someone who's sort of technophobic , the fact that it simply looks unfamiliar would be daunting . # ME: I think it's totally radical to have a remote control with no numbered buttons , But like radical good , maybe . # PM: don't know how lo much longer we've got . # PM: At least five minutes I think . # PM: quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation . # PM: we've got these four criteria here for satisfaction . # PM: Does anybody want to um do you have any opinions on any of them ? # PM: For example we'll work backwards I suppose . # PM: The ability to work on this project using the technology we've been presented with . # PM: people made good use of the pen and paper ? # UI: got notes and doodles . # ME: Wrote nearly a page , but not . # PM: I'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be . # UI: I think this is a I think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the # ME: I think tracking . # UI: of the researchers studying this . # UI: It's all p goes into their corpus . # UI: Though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the transfer our n our paper notes onto the computer ourselves . # ME: , that woulda been pretty good . # PM: It does seem like the paper's still a heavy consideration for taking notes . # PM: So maybe this is literally just a way around it . # PM: How are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today ? # PM: Leadership . As much as can be leadered in this thing . # PM: last one we've got is room for creativity . # UI: Unti uh until accounts came along , # PM: I think we got # ID: We're burs bursting with creativity . # ME: We we're not lacking in ideas , you know that was not the problem . # PM: I think of in the end , ideas that can be used sadly . # PM: Not so much that we weren't full of ideas , but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing . # PM: It's a bit of a pity . # PM: I would have to agree on that . # PM: I think we needed a larger budget . # PM: If you're going to aim your a product maybe at the technological kind of sector , then you can afford to maybe jack the price up slightly from what it is . # PM: Because they will pay outrageous cash to # UI: Mm . I mean I th I mean I think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in # PM: first on the market . # UI: in added expense . # ID: And the price was like it was twice the w assembly cost . # ID: And would it have to be twice that ? # ID: It could be like coulda had the assembly like maybe fifteen Euro . # PM: It could even # ID: We'll still settle for twenty five . # PM: I suppose these are all that will have to be taken up with a at a different group at I guess . As to a the costs involved . # PM: But I mean we've got a prototype . # PM: I dunno , I think it's gone okay today , considering the information that we've had at our disposal , and such . # ME: Maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more , to begin with . # ID: In the beginning , . # PM: Probably would have mean we could have come up with a lot more solid design in the end , I would have to agree . # PM: It is very much a pity to get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive . # PM: Always hard to tell until you know the costs . # PM: Are the costs within budget ? # PM: they are now that we have our slightly less than capable product . # PM: We've evaluated it , and we can say that we came out with a value of three . # UI: Actually I want th one thing I would say I mean something that could perhaps be part of the product mm the m product testing market research process would be to produce mock-ups of both versions and see just how much of a difference the over going over-budget m would make to sales . # ME: And like response from consumers . # UI: And we could even you know , market two versions . # UI: Wee cheapie version with the nice bio-morphic rubber . # PM: And then the final one where you get to call it Hal . # PM: But we'll go into that later . # PM: is there anything else that anybody would like to add , anything they think that's not been covered , before I quickly write up a final report . # PM: I dunno , I mean we've got a product . # PM: We maybe aren't as happy with it as we'd like to be , but we've got something we think we can maybe stick onto the market and sell . # PM: And of course something we have been avoiding talking about 'cause of we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers . # PM: There is a huge market . # PM: I mean we've briefly touched on it but we've no more knowledge then there's little we can say on that . # PM: unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add , we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we'd need to and then we can finish up the writing and such . # UI: And I can get my bus . # PM: thank you for your participation . # ME: I was actually kind of upset you know at the budget , and that we had to cut a lot of stuff . # ME: It's like man , we can't have the locator thing . # ME: that's just bad . # ME: Do you think maybe the prices were made ? # PM: That a question we can ask .
# PM: Welcome everybody . # PM: , I'm Abigail Claflin . # PM: You can call me Abbie . # PM: 'S see . PowerPoint , that's not it . # PM: So this is our kick off meeting . # PM: and I guess we should all get acquainted . # PM: Let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? # ME: Hi I'm Chiara , I'm the Marketing Expert . # ME: , would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? # PM: I think we'll get around to that , . # PM: So this is just introductions . # ME: We'll get round to that later . # ME: My name is Chiara and I'm the Marketing Expert . # PM: I forgot to s say I'm the Project Manager but I figured you all knew that already , # UI: I'm Stephanie and I am the User Interface Designer . # ID: I'm Krista and I'm the Industrial Designer . # PM: so f here's our agenda for today . # PM: we're gonna do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close . # PM: So our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . # PM: And to do this , we have to there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . # PM: We'll get to that . # PM: Oh there it is . # PM: Right . Functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . # PM: So throughout our next couple of meetings we'll be covering these things . # PM: so we're gonna try out our white board . # PM: If we'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal . # UI: So you want us to draw it and then talk about it ? Or just draw it ? # UI: Okay . Why don't we do both . Right . # ME: We ought to decide who starts and all that . # PM: Any volunteers ? # PM: Does anyone know what they wanna draw ? # UI: Mm , I gotta think about it for a second like . # UI: Does it have to be functional , trendy and user friendly ? # PM: I don't think so . # UI: Okay , I'll draw . I'll draw one . # UI: Make sure my things here . # UI: Okay , my favourite animal is # PM: 'S like playing Pictionary . # UI: , I guess it has a fin on top too , . # UI: It's my dolphin . # PM: So what characteristics do you like about your animal ? # UI: I like its tail . # UI: , no , I think dolphins are really I dunno , they're smart and they they're cute and they like swimming and that's cool , like # PM: They're graceful . # UI: they're graceful , and they're so they're sleek and they look intelligent and I don't know , they're I guess it's the whole like binocular vision thing . # PM: I don't know how intelligent that one looks . # UI: he doesn't look that smart . # UI: He's a I dunno they're I think it's cool the interaction that or the th things that the reasons people seem to like you know you get ex you know people are sitting on the beach and p they're like oh look there's dolphins and it's kinda like but they're you know they jump around in the water and they're happy and they're mammals , but they swim . # PM: Does anybody else wanna draw their animal ? # ID: Suppose I can draw an animal , . # PM: Uh-oh there goes the ten . # ID: They sleep all day , they're easy to draw . # PM: Do you wanna anything ? # PM: I dunno if the # ID: I think the pen is running out of # ME: Well I had the cat as well , but I've got a spare one . # ME: So I'll use the spare one . # ME: but it's harder to draw . # UI: And the pen's dying . # ME: I don't really know how the legs go , # PM: That's very good . # ME: but anyway I will do that . # ME: , and the main reason is they're pretty . # ME: I think they're very pretty and they go well with the environment , and I like the way they run and I used to do horse riding and they're just very sort of sturdy and nice animals . # ME: And I like the way they feel , sort of under the hand , I think that's pretty much it . # PM: This cord's Actually I haven't thought of anything yet . # PM: So I'm thinking we should design a remote control that's water resistant , strong and furry . # PM: What do you think , ? # PM: , well like a cat , you know , soft . # UI: Textile tactile , tactile remote control . # PM: Although I'll just put there . # UI: You're dragging a you have a tail . # PM: Oh my gosh , this is disastrous . # PM: Sorry about that . # PM: Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro and profit aim is fifty million Euro . # PM: So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland , we're in some European country . # PM: , and we will hope to sell this internationally . # UI: Sorry can you just say that what's the what are our price goals again ? # PM: selling price is twenty five Euro . Profit aim fifty million Euro . # ME: How many should we sell then ? # PM: Anyone a mathematician ? # ME: two million , two mi no , more f four million . # ME: Four million . # ME: well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million . # PM: So f that's a fifty percent . # PM: , I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make the slide-show . # PM: Experience with remote control . # PM: So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control . # PM: so do we have any initial ideas for how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the buttons it should have . # ME: , I think one thing is that it should be easy to find # UI: I was thinking that too . # UI: I think we should design something that has like a so you can like somehow like you I mean you always know where your T_V_ is , so just have a call button , I've always wanted that , so like you can push a button on your T_V_ # PM: I mean you have it for the portable phone , so why not . # UI: so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control . # ME: And even I think a little light . # ME: or even a maybe a vib a vibrating thing . # ME: I dunno but someth because it's usually under the sofa . # ME: In which case you're going to be l but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound I don't know if it's expensive maybe to # UI: I don't I mean it but like I mean # ME: Maybe call is enough . # UI: just I mean like your phone even just has so like it can vibrate , it can light up and make noise and I dunno # PM: What if it had something like just like a magnet on the back of it and you could I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base . # PM: You know like a portable phone has a base , # PM: like just to have a home for it . # PM: 'Cause people just stick it on top of their T_V_ , but the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the T_V_ , so # ID: Well that's why it's always in the couch . # UI: I dunno , it seems like though that would be hard , 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and # PM: Maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm . # UI: so we the project is now couches and remote controls . # ME: But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing , a pretty object attached to the wall . # ME: But that would really make it more expensive . # ME: But it's only a plastic thing , r really , the thing on the wall . # ME: Something like that . # PM: Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ? # ME: And the other thing is # ME: well it needs to be sort of # PM: hand held size , . # ME: I don't think you need a # PM: Not not huge , but # ME: But definitely not well I don't know . # UI: It can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it . # ME: No , it can't be , uh-uh . # ID: No it really wouldn't be . # UI: Or like or like a light thing . # UI: You know . I dunno # ME: Like spaceship . # UI: Or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you . # UI: That would be really I'm sure we could do that for twenty five Euros a pop . # PM: Little homing device . # PM: So what do we think this remote control should Five minutes . # PM: Till the meeting oh right . # PM: This is what we have left . # UI: I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons , # UI: 'cause I hate that when they have too many buttons and # ID: B_ button and the F_ button , they don't do anything . # UI: I mean I know it has to have enough functions but like , I don't know you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them . So . # PM: what if may be a little fancy but what if it had like a little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions . # PM: Like the way a mobile phone does . # UI: That would be cool . # UI: I mean it just seems like # PM: So you could like if you have I dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels , you can the way you do it on your radio is that you what do you call it # PM: y but you can programme , so you can programme like your favourite channels , so like if you had a s # ME: But , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen . # PM: That's something we could decide . Mm . # UI: I guess they would go together somehow ? I dunno . # ME: Because , I don't know if it's I think it's e expensive , if you have if you use the telly screen , 'cause the telly's already a screen , then you can pro sort of have a programming function , really easy sort of arrow up and down , on the remote , and then use the telly as a screen . # UI: I'm thinking kind of # ME: Something like not it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do , is that what you mean ? # UI: Or like you h you see those you know people I'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those these things that at their house you know their entire house is so electronic , and they have like this one master control that and it's like a hand held like turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , I don't know if it must be it would probably must be ex too expensive though t like I dunno . # ME: But like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap . # PM: I mean , we have to remember our budget is twelve point twelve fifty for to actually make the device . # PM: but it's something to think about , . # UI: Well , I guess we have to get to that later , . # PM: I mean we'll have to see how much that would be . # ME: Or some it i we can find out probably on the internet how much it's and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water What was the word ? # ME: Water resistant . # ME: No but it's I thought , spot on . # ME: Good feel , tact tactile , good tactile feel , maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot . # ME: That's quite annoying . # PM: Maybe just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your like that's another . We should probably start wrapping up , we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into . # PM: , and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , which will be in another thirty minutes . # PM: The Industrial Designer , what does that stand for , I_D_ , # PM: is going to be looking more into the working design . # PM: So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and that sort of thing . # PM: something , what is the U_I_ ? # PM: , what does it stand for again ? # UI: , User Interface design . # PM: User Interface Designer . # PM: So that's gonna be more technical . # PM: I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w # UI: So technical function . # ID: The working design is the structure . # UI: What is technical functions exactl I don't really know what # PM: , I guess you'd have to find out . # ME: It says on that email but it # ID: It was in the email . # UI: It does but it I just don't really # ID: I wrote down what mine were . # ME: It said It said # UI: What effect should the thing ha should it have , okay . Alright . # UI: And working design . # ME: Be a medium between you and the telly I think , # UI: And how it works , okay . Right . # PM: And the M_E_ , what does that stand for ? M # PM: Marketing , right . # ME: Marketing . Oh it's written here , but . # PM: So we'll be working on the user requirements , So I guess that wraps it up . # PM: I'll see you all in thirty minutes .
# PM: 'Kay so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . # PM: Welcome everybody . # PM: hope your sessions went well . # PM: so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . # PM: I've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings , and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . # PM: I I'll get the ones up for next time , they're not finished yet . # PM: so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this # ME: And I can start if you want . Mm . # ME: Is there an order ? # ME: We haven't decided on an order . # PM: No , any order's fine . # ME: , how do I put this I'll just put the cable in . # ME: So what happens it doesn't work ? # PM: It sh it takes a few seconds I think . # ID: You may need to # ID: But sometimes you have to do it # ME: Is it in the right thing ? # ID: it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press F_ eight . # ME: You need to help me . # PM: Uh-huh , and then press function . # UI: Could you just plug it back into hers because she had # ID: The cable might be a little loose or something . # ME: Right here we are . # ME: In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . # ME: , the findings in some cases matched what we were talking about . # ME: Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons . # ME: Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ . # ME: I don't know what R_S_I_ means . # ME: the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue . # ME: , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . # ME: So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . # ME: They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . # ME: so and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . # ME: Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . # ME: The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . # ME: about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . # ME: And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . # ME: I don't I don't know what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and , most likely , but we should discuss this together . # ME: And that's all I have to say about the matter , . # ME: Shall I what do I do ? # ME: Do I give this to someone else ? # PM: Just move right on . # UI: Okay so now I need to press F_ eight , what is it ? # PM: function F_ eight . # ME: Function F_ eight . # UI: What's function ? # PM: It's the little blue w it's the one th # UI: Oh function , I see it . # UI: This my presentation about the technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on just what functions we need and how to make that the best function for the user . # UI: So and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet . # UI: And okay so basically I think i like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . # UI: so I think things like you know keeping buttons together that like close together that are used in the same way , or maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it is it can you c y small enough large enough I'm not sure we c I guess we would need to do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_ . # UI: Does it have like capacity to change the channels ? # UI: does it do or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ? # UI: And then , is it findable , and how do we wanna do that ? # UI: I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , I dunno if this will work but And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . # UI: Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . # UI: That concludes my presentation . # UI: Okay . You need the little thingy . # ME: That's on view . # ID: Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the mechanical functions of the remote , and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . # ID: so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . # ID: And also we talked about a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . # ID: So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , input which would probably be buttons , although we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , something to transmit it to the T_V_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . # ID: And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall . # ID: And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . # ID: Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . # ID: And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . # ID: That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . # ID: so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , a button pad for input , we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , that's just sort of standard , so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver . # ID: Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . # ID: So that concludes my presentation . # UI: Do you know about like I dunno , you seem like you know about # ID: , I d I was an engineer before I came here . # PM: Well thank you everybody . # PM: we have we'll discuss that and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . # PM: , teletext is apparently outdated , so due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . , also our remote should be used only for television , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . # PM: and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable I guess . # PM: if we have something I mean silver and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . # PM: So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . # PM: , . Do Let's I guess we should make some kind of brainstorming , see what we can # UI: Like in terms of # ME: How it looks or # UI: how it looks , or like what it does ? # PM: wha what well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and I dunno the s the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . So . # UI: Is our target group then people so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? # PM: I think that seems to . Mm . # ID: It's easy to implement . # ME: the buzzer you mean , # UI: So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , # PM: , teenagers and young professionals . # ME: Well that's for speech recognition . # ME: That's only for speech recognition and screen . # ID: I was thinking about that but I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme , and also , if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one , it seems like a silly , I'm not sure how you would implement it . # ME: I just put the values in . # PM: And if you consider our budget , it probably # ME: But the screen is the same as what , # ID: It's a cool idea but # PM: if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey . # ME: , I'm happy with that . # UI: Okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the T_V_ itself . # ID: Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place since the T_V_ already has power . # ID: you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work , so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . # ID: Sends out a signal and then the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably . # PM: So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can # ID: It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote . # ME: So do you plug it in the T_ you plug it in T_V_ , this thing ? # ID: , it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ so if you need to find the remote , click the button . # UI: So it's now like a two-part thing . # ID: , so it would be a two part package . # UI: Okay . Alright . # UI: So we get to design that too . # UI: Make it fashionable . # PM: So do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals . # ME: Mm . Are we should that thing be on the thing to put the you s you talking about a home for it . # ME: Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ? # PM: We probably leave that . # PM: I mean I guess one takes care of the other , like if you can if you can call it then it's # UI: Then it can live anywhere . # ME: For the so you have that button , that so there's is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ? # ID: on the T_V_ or on the phone ? # ME: Are we just having a radio ? # ID: it seemed like a beep seemed the most reasonable to me , # ME: You don't need a light . # ID: I think that's what the phone has , I mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever . # PM: And like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so # ME: You can hear it's under the couch . # ME: So need the other buttons . # ME: So we have this mm . # PM: So I mean the two remotes that you had shown r I don't remember who showed them , you did , # UI: That was that was me . # PM: they're I mean one looked like it was for V_C_R_ type thing , and the other looked like just television . # UI: I think w I think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes . # PM: 'Cause that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities . # ID: Does anyone know if V_C_R_s are the same across international ? # PM: They're not no . # ME: They're not , no . # ID: Okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s . # ME: It not V_H_S_ here ? # PM: But D_V_D_ probably is . # ID: , other than that region and coding thing . # PM: And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type , that's the technology these days . # ME: But V_C_R_s . , for sure . # UI: So . Okay , let's see if I can I think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take like just reduce the number of buttons you know , like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_ . # ME: Well for sure we need the I think we can just design the channels ? # ME: I mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much , s and it's usually that red and I think it's quite nice to keep it like red . # PM: You know , I've seen some remotes that where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . # PM: So you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just # UI: It seems like that would be hard though . # UI: I mean , like because unless you know # PM: It might be confusing . # UI: Just 'cause I wouldn't I would probably pick it up and just be like why is there no on button . # PM: Besides you like to be able to go power . # ID: , I never think to hold something down . # PM: I have the power I guess . # PM: So we definitely want a power button and numbers . # ME: Well even iPod thing , I don't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of # UI: That sort of like joystick flat touch thing , . # ME: scrolling I don't know . # ME: Because people li seem now the iPod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no Know you don't have one two three four five # UI: I think that's an interesting idea , 'cause it's cool , it's funny like you f like I just I don't have an iPod but like I , you know , I just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day , and you just sort of and it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , like it's not that hard , you know . # ME: , it's just and it's one thing which has everything . # UI: It is really but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ? # ME: Well can't it tell the like can't you if you # ID: , you can have the number going around in the corner . # ME: you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then # UI: Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button . # PM: Oh that's gonna Is that like on a mouse pad where like kind of # UI: It's like it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad . # PM: I've never used one . No . # ME: It's like l this like that , and then you do that . # ME: And then you can have if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus . # UI: So like it's like a little part of the circle that oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can # ME: you can , click o actually click on to have # PM: We could we could even have four buttons , like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well . # UI: So volume could be like the top it and the bottom So do you need to # ID: Doesn't it rotate though , so it'll be moving around . # UI: Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like # ME: What do you mean the function ? # UI: I mean like okay , 'cause so I dunno , I guess Okay so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise . # UI: That that means you're gonna go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down . # UI: But then so if you wanna switch to the to u do you have to switch to a function where like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that's that way and volume is up and down . # ME: but it knows for some reason . # ME: The iPod knows . # UI: It just kno the iPod knows . S # ID: If it works on an iPod then it works . # UI: So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want . # ID: I don't have one . # ME: Well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up . # UI: Okay . That's what I mean . Okay . # UI: Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down . # PM: So it's like holding # ME: And then well if you do that it goes , but if you like that makes more sense 'cause there's already ones with up and down here , that I've seen . # PM: You can o And you is there an extra actual button ? # PM: Or are you actually you're just using the mouse to go up and down . # ME: Well what you # ME: for the iPod you press an w right if you're on the channel let's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down . # ME: But if you wanna keep it with volume here and here , I'm pretty sure # PM: Well I mean if you're gonna this for channels , right , then y wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow ? # PM: Like you could just have # ME: you could click and then have it up and down , # PM: Oh you could actually # UI: I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod . # UI: But the only thing is like , iPods are so expensive , like , it has to be is that part of # PM: Is that what makes them expensi I think it's all of # ID: I don't think so . # UI: I dunno , I dunno . # PM: they have so much memory though , that's it's # UI: You don't think so ? # ID: I don't think it's the wheel dealy . # PM: I think it's the h it's their capabili I mean they it can hold what like five thousand songs or something . # UI: I'm thinking we could if we're hav So ba I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know . # ID: And they're re-programmable aren't they ? # ID: You can put on your songs and then put on a different set , that's probably why they're expensive , they're like little computers . # UI: Well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just # ME: Well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass . # ME: Because , the other thing , I didn't tell you all my presentation , is that people find it find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote and that's another thing they complained about . # ME: , what other buttons were there ? # ME: Volume oh we've ts just said that . # ME: Channel selection . # UI: This is just for T_V_ , it's not for or it is does need to be compatible with # ID: A D_V_D_ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject , # PM: You know actually our new project requirements , I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things . # UI: So how do you switch # ID: and menu maybe . # PM: So I'll check that and update you on the next # UI: So like if we had that # PM: But we'll hold off on that 'cause # ME: But D_V_D_ players usually have their own remote . # UI: So , I know I'm not c really clear on what # ID: But it's cool to have it all on one , because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch . # UI: you'd have to have like I think you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can you're either on T_V_ , you're on D_V_D_ or you're on V_C_R_ , or you're like . So # ID: Well but D_V_D_ is only like four buttons . # ME: , it is only fun # UI: but I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad . # ID: But I think the circle only does channel isn't applicable to D_V_D_ really 'cause you don't wanna # UI: but it would be # ID: but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch . # UI: So but I'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , so like you're if you're on T_V_ , like you can switch channels , but then if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or s you know , to different I mean do we need to think about that , # PM: , let's think about it # ID: Yes we can try that . # PM: 'cause we need to wrap up .
# PM: Hi everyone , hope you had a nice lunch . # PM: Alright we're moving on to conceptual design . # PM: , I'll just review what we did in our last meeting . # PM: , under marketing we targeted our audience , That was generally how helpful that was . # PM: , then we considered some design options with how it should look , we discussed an iPod-like button system which , we haven't concluded but we're So , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time . # PM: Does everyone have presentations ? # PM: Would anybody like to go first ? # ID: So I've been looking at the components design . # ID: Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . # ID: , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . # ID: , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . # ID: And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . # ID: But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . # ID: , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , the iPod-style wheel . # ID: The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . # ID: , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . # ID: And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . # ID: So we have some material options . # ID: , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . # ID: , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . # ID: , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case . # PM: And why not wood ? # PM: And why not wood ? # ID: , well we can use wood . # ID: I don't know why we'd want to . # ID: and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . # ID: We can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . # ID: I don't think it's much more expensive , but it is more expensive . # ID: So that's what I've got on design . # ME: , can I do next ? 'Cause I have to say something about the material which is quite shocking . # ME: Right , I have been searching the current trends , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion , fancy look and feel . # ME: Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . # ME: And th last thing is the easy to use factor . # ME: , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but I suppose that is included in the ease of use . # ME: , our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend and therefore we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is . # ME: For fashion , we go for fashion . # ME: The fashion in electronics . # ME: So we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . # ME: And also go for a spongy feel , so the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer . # ME: As to the material should be limited to I don't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go . # ME: I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables , but that's just a personal opinion . # ME: I think I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room . # ME: those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ? # ME: , and finally again with the spongy . # ME: It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find come up with a solution that's better than mine . # ME: , to summarise these are the points that need to be , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter . # ME: Thank you for your attention . # PM: I think it's the next it's the blue one , . # UI: Oh , there we go . # UI: Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh . # UI: I actually wasn't aware of the new trends in electronics and # ME: Neither was I . # ME: Well it's a trend in fashion , in clothing and fabrics . # PM: but you're not gonna wear your remote control . # UI: So so okay , let me get this right . # UI: Okay , alright anyway . # UI: Conceptual User Interface . # UI: Trying we're gonna try to talk about , what kind of how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design . # UI: And , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system . # UI: , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . # UI: , kind of I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ? # PM: Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time . # UI: 'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the wheel # PM: You need a screen for it ? # UI: it seems like you would need a screen . # ID: You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song , like you know that band or whatever . # ID: With T_V_ channels it's , you know , one two three . So # UI: But like if you think about it so is it just okay . # UI: So , b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that , aren't you ? # PM: We're , we're actually not having D_V_D_ , that was one of th I was I meant to update you on that . # UI: Alright . Okay . # ME: But the screen can come up on the telly , the she said . # ME: That correct ? # UI: So anyway if well we just we need to Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen I think I was thinking okay . # UI: So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ? # UI: And you're just gonna I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a # ME: Graphical interface ? # ME: you can have it on the telly though . # UI: like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can okay we're not choosing that , I guess . # UI: But like choose channel control , like if you wa Because people aren't gonna be able to have like , you know , channels one two three four five six seven eight nine . # UI: So that people seems to be well # PM: , I know what you're saying , you have to # UI: But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels . # UI: I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if then again if you just I guess I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on . # UI: You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or # PM: But but imagine someone with s # ID: My flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it did show up on the T_V_ . # PM: But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels . # PM: Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to # UI: 'Cause you'll have to like # ID: They have to r wheel really fast . # UI: but you can quickly s you can # ID: But I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels , at least on theirs . # UI: if you do , it w so it would have to be you I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , So you're either you're you know , th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , different , whatchamacallits , different , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels . # UI: Like if you just wanted to go to like from five to six you could tap or someth And then there's also the concern about you know how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , or if you want to you know switch around , I don't know , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something like that , # PM: I mean with that many options , you'd I'd think that the screen would be better , because you could have that menu option , sort of # UI: I would think so too , like So I mean and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know , because but then again it would it does make kind of if the screen's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's kind of # ID: It's more expensive according to the design people . # UI: , that's the only thing though . # ID: You have to get a an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal . # UI: So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing , You can get to you know , you can Like maybe it'll be that central button that , like , then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the T_V_ and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the # PM: So the T_V_ is the screen , that So it would have all these different options of changing # UI: But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up . # ME: Look it even has settings . # ME: you can just take theirs and just # UI: , well we don't want the screen I guess , 'cause that just it does seem like , it that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but I dunno , and then so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything . # PM: What if I mean , if you're thinking of the design of it now , like the a you know , physical attributes , and you just have this , it's like just a long silver thing , or whatever we're thinking . # PM: I mean are you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ? # UI: It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the T_V_ . # PM: So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before . # UI: Like , I think we're looking at something that could be , like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing . # UI: I mean it needs to be easy to # ME: but should be comfortable . # UI: somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your I mean how do how do I'm not really Like when I use an iPod , I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it . So # PM: I've seen some people just going like that with their thumb , . # UI: . Or your thumb or something . So # ME: I use it like that . # ID: W when we had the wheely remote control , we it was on the top I think , if you held it like that . # PM: But , were there buttons on there as well ? # ID: well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I don't know what they do . # ID: So we just used the top part . # UI: but I mean I think it could be pretty small . # UI: Like , I d I mean , you want it to be large enough that you can # PM: What if , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ? # PM: Like you so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that ? # PM: So the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it . # UI: But can't you just get # PM: do you know what I'm talking about though ? # PM: Like , just something # ID: like maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it's got a whole bunch of # ME: Well you can have it on the settings , # PM: , that you can flip over , . # UI: But , I mean , do you need that ? # UI: If if you can get to , you know if so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the T_V_ screen . # PM: mean I guess that's the thing is if w I # UI: That keeps it # PM: if we can do this , that'd probably be # UI: really you wouldn't I just don't think you would even need it . # PM: So I guess we have to look into the , like , the programming , how this how they actually programme these things , and if that's # ID: Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_ ? # PM: I mean it would y would that would be # UI: I mean you can do it , # ME: They already do it . # ID: I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_ , not inside the remote . # UI: you it's it doesn't seem that hard . # UI: I mean I've never bought a remote . # UI: It sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television , # ID: Well they usually are . # UI: which is a little I've never bought just a remote , like , so I don't I don't really know . # ID: I guess that's right . It always comes with the T_V_ . # UI: but I mean it's I've never had a hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know . # UI: And I don't think that should that should be too hard . # ID: most of the ones we've had have had the menu button , 'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something . # ID: 'Cause it just doesn't come up every day or something . # UI: Well so So , do we need I dunno . # UI: Well I guess we have to you know think about But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up . # UI: That's what it does anyway . # ME: But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand , # PM: you don't know they mean , it's like # ME: and I never get it . # UI: oh , you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen ? # ME: Well on the telly . # ID: Or on the T_V_ too . # UI: On the telly , okay , . # UI: So I think , I mean , I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really cool idea because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those like okay now I hit this you know , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date . # PM: And it is technologically innovative in a way , so that fits with the # UI: And it is trendy , the iPods are really hot right now , so # ME: Did you did you get that pc picture on did they provide you with that picture on the web ? # UI: by web research , # ME: That's quite interesting . # ME: What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that I'm dreading ? # ID: Oh , I was gonna say . # ID: You said people want spongy . # ID: , one of your one of the material options is a sort of rubber that's in like those stress ball things . # ID: So , that would be spongy . # UI: Oh , okay , that would be cool . # ME: Just nice feel , but I hate spongy . # UI: c that's e that would be kind of oh , you know , usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type , you know , thing . # PM: I mean definitely the area round it . # UI: But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda so you're like # ID: I think it could work . # UI: Or what if we integrated the f what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables we somehow made it tactilely fash you know , we c tapped into that , so like it feels like # ID: Don't think I'd want it to feel like a banana . # ME: Well it could be like mobiles that just you just put a cover . # ME: If it's a small thing , you c instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana , which frankly I'm not particularly fond of , you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing . # ME: You know you had there was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles . # ID: You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits . # UI: You could name it after fruits and vegetables , or # ME: And it could the colour can fit your sitting room , so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry , and then if you have a green one you can have well I don't know . # PM: So what if what # PM: I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking . # PM: If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand , so like what you're feeling is comfortable , and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is . # PM: And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there . # PM: Is that kind of I 'cause I I'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours . # UI: Unfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables . # PM: I mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we've just the feedback we've just got about the # ME: Know , a squashy ball . # ME: A relaxing squashy ball . # ME: That you can p # UI: That's in the shape of a fruit , like a # ME: see you're thinking , it's weird , you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the hard bit and I'm thinking how do you change the hard would you put a sticker sort of ? # ME: Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit , # PM: This is just Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit . Squashy . # ME: I was thinking of getting a cover for # PM: see I was thinking this s # ME: Which is cheaper . # ME: Well I don't know if it's cheaper actually . # PM: I was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing . # PM: And like this you could have like you could have like cherries and things around there . # UI: Oh I like that shape . # ID: I was thinking sort of a single ball shape . # PM: I was thinking if it was like this # ID: So you're holding a squishy ball # PM: 'cause the way you were describing the iPod and the thi the roll thingy # ID: and then it has a # UI: It's like it has to be s # PM: It's almost like your thumb is farther up , so if you could squish it lower then # ME: So it wouldn't be very big in either like how big ? # ME: This big , and then you just do that , I suppose . # PM: , I know what you meant , . # UI: What if , what if the squishy , oh so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , and you can so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing and you could get you could have your choice , you know ? # ME: Well just a li I can't des like condom thingy , like a cover . # ME: But well the question is , which one's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that , and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that , and for now we can do two prototypes maybe and then hi try and ask users what the best is , That's nicer . # ME: I think it's nicer to have a drawing 'cause it's neater . # PM: Well that's not very neat , but # UI: I mean I think and I think the handhe I think the handheld part is definitely So you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part . # ME: If it's a bit like those juggling balls , you can change shape according to your to the way you hold it . # ID: you could squish it . # ME: If it's got sand in it maybe , or something , you it just moulds to your hand . # UI: So where are the fruit and vegetables now ? # ID: I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front , or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath . # UI: Fruits and veg . # ME: We we don't know . # ME: And the rest is the company the company colour's silver ? # PM: It was , silver and yellow . # PM: It l it looks like # UI: We could promote the banana one . # PM: I mean that's another question , where are we gonna we should have the logo somewhere on it . # ME: Should also fit the batteries , which we haven't # ID: I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case . # PM: th and that would that # ID: Especially if you're switching out the squishy part . # ID: Then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off . # UI: , I think , it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit . # UI: The part that you , can change into the different , you know , trendy vegetables and fruits . # ID: You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand . # ID: Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again . # ME: No but it does it automatically . # ME: Does it automatically ? # PM: I don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me . # PM: But if someone components concept . Question mark . # PM: Energy . Question mark . # PM: , so what d but what do we know about energy ? # PM: I mean we're gonna use batteries right ? # ID: we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and a dynamo , which is something I don't know what it is . # ID: Something to do with torches . # ME: Oh , a dynamo is , it's a bicycle . It's a bicycle mechanism . # ME: It's the en it's like if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy . # ID: , the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself . # ID: So I sort of picked battery . # ME: It's quite sweet . # ID: We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . # ID: but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways . # PM: I think batteries sound good . # ID: It it seems a little weird for a living room anyways . # PM: What does everyone else think ? # UI: The dynamo would be interesting . # ME: No . But dynamo the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it creates energy on its own . # PM: What about Kryptonite ? # ME: Which is quite cool . # ME: So if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying . # ME: But we need to find cost . # ME: Don't know the cost . # ID: Didn't have enough data to actually # ME: Does anyone have costs on the on the web ? # ID: All it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things . # ID: It didn't give me any actual cost . # ID: Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk . # ID: So I don't think it's that much of a problem . # ID: Like the chip is probably the most expensive part . # PM: What does chip on print mean ? # ID: , for things like remote controls , they stamp out a chip , calculators too I think . # ID: , so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap . # ID: But it's not like a computer , you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls , it's like stamped onto the chip . # PM: So , chip on print is just means like that they're mass-produced . # PM: I guess that's what we've been talking about , # ID: Case is what we were discussing . # PM: thinking of like syntactic case and thi let's see . # PM: Is there anything else we need to talk about ? # PM: Oh when we move on , you two are going to be playing with play-dough . # PM: , and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design . # PM: And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation . # PM: So you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach . # PM: Does it matter that I end early ? # ME: I it's strange because # PM: How how early is it ? # PM: I didn't get a pop-up thing that said .
# PM: Okay everybody . Welcome to the detailed design meeting . # PM: Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . # PM: and I think looks like we've come up with some ideas . # PM: and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary . # PM: so for later in the meeting I've done a spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take a look at that . # PM: and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it . # PM: so actually I think you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of # ID: So our design looks something like this . # ID: This being the wheel that you use to change channels or volume or whatever . # ID: This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu . # ID: And the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . # ID: So you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever . # UI: You could change the vegetable , or fruit . # ID: , I can change the vegetable . # PM: Oh is that broccoli ? # ID: This one's broccoli . # ID: So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . # ID: This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it . # ID: This is a mango . # ID: it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits . # ID: You don't have orange , you have mango . # ID: I guess strawberry's not as trendy , but # PM: 'S a very bright strawberry . # ID: So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control . # ID: And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out . # UI: It's been a l It's been a little bit difficult to make sure that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big . # UI: but we think that this you know , this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow . # UI: And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was or design yet actually , would be the thing the locator . # ID: Well the locator is just chip that's inside there . # UI: so that's just # ID: And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere # UI: So you have to have a button on your on your you have to attach the button to the # ID: we didn't design that . # UI: we have that has yes yet to be designed . # ID: But it would be coordinating with that of course . # UI: that c hey that could you know match the handset . # UI: You could have a broccoli , or you could have a mango . # PM: if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an Excel spreadsheet . # PM: the only one that's in there , production costs . # PM: And if you open it up . # PM: I've just stuck the numbers in , it was a real challenge there . # PM: But if I missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed I mean , we decided on batteries , and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button . # PM: I said uncurved or flat . # PM: I think that's what you have there , is that right ? # PM: For the for the plastic part would be # ID: My impression was that flat meant like one of those square remotes . # ID: But it's really not very clear , because you got single curve and double curve and d I dunno what that means . # ID: One side is curved and then the other side is curved . # PM: If we're talking about the area just I dunno . # PM: I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see . # PM: There's plastic for that area around the button . # PM: and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right ? # PM: and lots of special colours actually . # PM: scroll wheel . # PM: Do you see anything that I've missed ? # ID: I think that's alright . # PM: Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit . # PM: And if we sold a lot of squishy things . # PM: Did y what did you work on ? # ME: evaluation criteria . # ME: I've got a presentation . # PM: Okay . I think that's # ME: So I need where's the cable ? # ME: Right what happens is we have to decide whether this whole this whole project we've been working on actually meets the standards we were set at the start . # ME: This doesn't the method is we well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing . # ME: And the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is everything's listed down . # ME: , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use . # ME: These are all things we looked at the start , and criteria that have to be met . # ME: We have to use a table , I'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards . # ME: And we have therefore in total We have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . # ME: And the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . # ME: I would like to show you the table we have to use . # ME: This is the table . # ME: Can you see this here ? # ME: so the que the questions I've given you c could you write that down ? # ME: True is one and false is seven . # ME: And we'll just go through each point together , hopefully . # ME: I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow . # ME: I dunno how it works exactly , I haven't been told . # UI: Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own # ME: it's in the it's in the project documents . # UI: Is it meeting three minutes ? # UI: No it's not minutes . # ME: It's called evaluation criteria . # ME: And it's under evaluation . # PM: Huh , the PowerPoint one ? # ME: You've found it all ? # ME: So it was true's one . # UI: True's one and false is seven . # ME: Do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly ? # PM: we can do it separately and then discuss it if that's what people wanna do . # UI: So it's actually a scale . # PM: Wait , one is true and so these are the questions we're answering . # ME: it's if it's fancy you put one , # PM: One , right okay . # ME: if it's really unfancy it's seven . # PM: If it's somewhere in between you put four . # UI: Does it feel fancy ? # ID: Feels like play-dough . # ME: They shouldn't really be questions . # ME: Should be more like Are the batteries easy to insert ? # ID: I'm gonna say yes . # ME: Yes ? Very very true . Okay . # ID: I imagine they're somewhere on the front . # ID: We have a little case that you slip 'em in . # PM: Are we just about ready ? # ME: Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard . # ME: is it necessary ? # PM: I don't think so . # PM: the marker thing kinda stopped working last time we Our animals will forever be there . # PM: Un unless you feel you need it t to # ME: I don't feel any # ME: Right so one point one ? # ME: We'll just go in a circle . # ME: Ooh I don't know . # ME: Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four ? # ME: Is that what the company does ? # PM: I think we should # ID: It's four if you wanna do that . # ID: It adds to sixteen , so that's four . # ME: Oh no . It adds to thirteen . One five two . # ID: Oh I thought she said five . # ME: One five two is thirteen , over four for now . # ME: I think that's Really ? # PM: I wasn't cheating I swear . # ME: One point three is # UI: So it's a one was true and seven was false ? # UI: Okay , so you guys really didn't like it ? # PM: Oh I thought it was the other way round . # ID: Wait a minute . # ID: I thought it was the other way round too . # PM: So we do have about the same thing , we just have it the other way # ID: I was thinking one means no points , you know , all the way up to the top . # ME: It was one is true and false is seven . # ME: I should've kept the table up . # PM: Oh gosh . Okay . Well # ID: I'll just I'll just reverse them all . # ID: It's no problem . # ME: Right , well I'm glad this came out . # ID: I thought you guys hated it . # UI: I was like , why did you guys design it that way if you hated it ? # ME: Oh that's quite funny . # ME: Okay . So , starting again , one point one ? # ME: Okay , one point two ? # ME: Okay . , one point three ? # ME: Two point one ? # PM: Two point I think I missed two . # PM: Wait , is that two point one ? # ID: I put it down as one point four for some reason . # PM: One point four , one point five . Okay right # ME: Oh dear , okay . Sorry . # PM: that's I have two of them . # ID: Mine has all kinds of problems . # ME: Sorry about that . # ME: T two point two , which is one point five . # ID: Wait why did I put three ? # ID: I meant one on mine too . # ME: Three point one . # ME: Is that correct on my slide ? # ID: Three point one . # ME: One , four , three , three , three point two ? # ME: Three point three . # ME: Four point one ? # ME: Four point two . # ME: and four point three . # ME: Right so I put one on that . # ME: Okay I'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue . # ME: Or is it tedious ? # ME: I'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone . # PM: No no that's I think we should look at the ones that like where s where people said four , where it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote . # ME: I didn't know how else to do it . # ME: Well the worst ones were three point one . # ME: does every ones have the slide ? # ME: Three point one . # PM: that was material . # ME: Material technologically innovative , do you want to change it ? # ME: What are the suggestions ? # ME: I don't know , anyone ? # UI: Which one is that again sorry ? # UI: Three point one ? # ME: that it's three point one was not that good . # ME: Four point one . # PM: Does the shape # ME: Four point two ? # PM: See I'm having I'm having trouble imagining is it gonna be the size , like the controller ? # ID: I think the wheel would probably be mm . # UI: What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ? # UI: And like then it you could hold it in your hand better . # ID: I think the base would definitely be larger , 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold . # ID: They're kinda smallish . # PM: No but I imagine even if it was bigger , like if it's round and it's big then you can't get that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of # PM: so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers . # PM: but I don't s I personally don't think this is comfortable to sit there , like it's an awkward position . # UI: I didn't But like if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat # ID: Well if they're that s stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable . # UI: But it's still too big I think , in your hand . # PM: And would it even resemble fruit that way ? # UI: like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection , like you could probably do a strawberry still . # UI: I think the broccoli would be out . # UI: You could do , although the broccoli is quite comfortable , I have to say , like sorta like a joystick . # PM: that I when you were holding that before , it actually looked . # ME: That looked really good . # UI: I don't know . So # ME: Are there any fruits that look like broccoli , no ? # ID: Not that I can think of . # ME: I think that broccoli is my favourite actually . # UI: These obscure fruits . # UI: I think we needn't # PM: What if the it was just patterns on like we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber . # PM: You know like just a printed or coloured . # ID: So it's just colour , and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry . # UI: That could work . # PM: Or I mean we could even have fruit like around # PM: But if we if we need # ME: and just have the colour match or something . # PM: And if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow , there might be I mean if it if it in if it conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the # UI: 'Cause no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously . # UI: Or like I dunno , some of 'em you can kind of think see as like you could if it was only this you know , if it was shaped like that , and it just had that . # UI: But you see the problem is you have to attach that , and this has to be detachable . # UI: So like maybe that's just too big # PM: Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that , # PM: which is a nice kind of # UI: it's sorta like a joystick . # PM: I mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape ? # PM: 'Cause like kind of # ID: We could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call 'em the different fruits . # ID: We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough . # PM: Or even like you said , like a joystick like that . # UI: Like we could do I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped . # PM: 'Cause that , I think I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea . # PM: And you still have the comfort of holding it like that . # PM: And you could like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part . # PM: But I mean it do we have any other ideas about that ? # UI: We could tr I don't know . # ME: Think the critical ones came out to be that one . # ME: Batteries easy to insert for some reason , which can be easily I think that's not a problem any more . # PM: The batteries are going in the back ? # ID: everyone gave that a one or a two . # ID: they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote . # PM: The reason I ga I didn't give it a one I think I gave it a three because I thought you'd have to like unc clip # ID: No I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door , # PM: no you could Just like any other one . # ID: like on a normal remote . # ID: So it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there , but it'd be on one of the sides probably . # ME: I think everyone's under three anyway . # ME: So I think it's those are the only two points . # UI: the broccoli I guess wins . # ID: I'd agree with changing the shape . # ID: , I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff . # UI: We were a bit off task . # UI: so I can't think of any So we'll have to like I dunno . # UI: You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like , # ID: It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape . # UI: but you could do like that's true . # PM: And it would probably cost more to produce , 'cause they're irregular . # ID: I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too . # PM: Which is why printing might be like just printing the fruit on fruit . # PM: Not really Well we've done finance evaluation criteria , production evaluation . # PM: so project evaluation . # ME: Do you want this and we can all # PM: I guess we're supposed to discuss the prod the process of the project and how satisfied oh , oh it's alright . # PM: Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of I mean fruit and squishiness . How c more creative can you get ? # UI: The prototype making was very creatively stimulating and I think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria . # PM: And how was our leadership and teamwork ? # ID: I think it was good . # ID: We knew what we were doing . # ID: It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute . # PM: Well I thought my leadership was crap personally . # ID: Well you told us when to start and when to end , and that's all that matters . # PM: Excuse me , am I allowed to say that ? # UI: I think you were fine . # PM: , well I'm never gonna do a management position , I know that now . # UI: You did a good job leading . # PM: , I thought we all worked very well together . # ME: we didn't we it all c sort of blended quite well . # UI: I think it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much , as we just would be like I don't know , all had ideas about it but # PM: Very democratic . # PM: No spats , that was good . # PM: and the means for like the materials we used , how convenient were they ? # PM: Like the pens , the whiteboard , I mean we used # ID: Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft , PowerPoint or any of this stuff . # PM: Are you a Mac person ? # ID: No no I never touch Macs either . # ID: I just use the Unix or the off market , sort of WordPerfect and all these other things . # ME: Which isn't very user-friendly though . # ID: Well the problem is if you don't like my new computer never has WordPerfect so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it . # ID: So I have all these documents I can't use now . # ID: But I mean I guess it's okay . # UI: I felt like my I dunno if it was just my role , but l but I di I thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like or maybe it was just the idea that we had . # UI: But there's kinda it was kinda like okay , I don't really think I dunno what I'm doing here . # UI: So I didn't really think it was helpful . # UI: So I kind of just made up my own stuff and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations , so I kind of wrote a lot of notes instead . # UI: But I d I don't really like PowerPoint personally , think it's kinda stupid . # ID: I never use it . # PM: I can't say I found everything particularly helpful . # UI: It didn't really # ID: My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works . # ME: I though it was brilliant no ? # ME: No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think . # PM: I mean m my problem # ID: it probably does . # ME: I think it depends on the role # PM: 'Cause my problem was , you guys had access to like they'd put send you to sites and stuff See I couldn't do that , so I didn't really know what you guys were doing . # PM: And when you were talking about it I was just like you know that's wh that's why I seemed so ignorant when you were j explaining things , 'cause I # ID: well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control . # ID: As if you'd wanted to . # ME: But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole # ME: a whole system , 'cause of course they can't give you uh anything comparable to the internet for the # ID: Well I think it's interesting how it all went together , like I had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap , and you have how people want it to be spongy , and It seems planned you know . # UI: I kinda thought that I felt like I would go and like try to use my information , or like I'd make this stupid little presentation and then like I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated because I dunno I felt like I was off-task all the time . # PM: Well I mean we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it wasn't necessarily what was like we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know ? # ID: If I hadn't been told that fruit was # ME: But I think that it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing . # PM: given certain information or # ME: , like if everyone's given the same input I don't have a clue , anyway . # ME: Looks like oh no that's not # PM: What do you guys think of the pens ? # PM: It asks about that . # ID: They're pretty cool . # ID: They're kinda hard to write with though . # PM: and I I've f forgotten once or twice to check the box . # UI: I I'd like to see what it looks like on the # ID: They're nicer than the pen that I'm using , because like your stuff actually shows up here , rather than having to look at the screen and write . # ID: But even so , I dunno . # PM: And new ideas found ? # ME: it's all very new , It's all very new . # UI: I think I'd like to I dunno . # UI: Like it was the I think the microphones are okay when you're sitting down , but like they're kinda clumsy I guess when you're like when you're s going up to the whiteboard like . # ID: Well they drop off if you like move too much . # UI: I dunno . But they're okay . # ID: But I don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones . # UI: I think , and I think that all this technology like I guess some people must be interested in using it but I can't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone's notes , # ID: Well the thing is , like I actually worked in a company , # UI: or like I dunno . # ID: and I had a role and I had to go to meetings . # ID: And like the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video 'cause I missed a meeting . # ID: Like usually I missed meetings deliberately . # ID: There's just there's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting , like when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company . # ID: It's mostly like rehashing old stuff . # ID: And you're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's sort of on task should already know . # ID: It's like the there's just really not a lot of information that goes through . # PM: Seems kind of like an excessive reiteration . # ID: It seems like way overkill . # ID: Like if I missed a meeting I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence . # ID: I wouldn't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and # UI: I guess it would be it's gotta be worth it to 'cause I'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would really find it useful , 'cause can't really imagine , dunno . # UI: How about a p a ? # PM: Well does anyone wanna talk about fruit more while we still have time ? # PM: Any other ideas for # ME: What what's the end ? # ME: Are we are we supposed to you supposed to write a report ? # PM: we still have time if there's any other input . # ME: Is that the end ? # PM: I mean the I think we did really well personally , which is why we've you know , gone through this so quickly . # PM: 'Cause I mean we've all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory , it fits the budget , and it's trendy . # ME: End of meeting . # ME: You have to tell her , # PM: So I think that's all for today . # ME: Okay we have to fill in all this stuff . # UI: M meeting adjourned . # PM: Meeting adjourned . # ID: I think I've learned not to bring play-dough to meetings . # UI: I think it would be a good idea , I like it . # ID: It's hard enough to get people actually paying attention . # ID: Especially if you have food . # PM: So I guess we're supposed to write final reports . # ME: Well there's al eight , nine . # PM: Or is that just me ? .
# ID: That's as far as it goes . # PM: Hi guys good morning everybody here . # PM: And I want to introduce myself , my name is Shrida Daseri and I'm a project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now . # PM: So I want to introduce first of all the names and the colleagues here . # PM: And what you're drawing ? # UI: my name is Agnes and I'm an user usability user interface designer . # ME: My name is Ed and I do accounting . # PM: how you spell your name ? # ID: Do you also do marketing ? # PM: So only accounting ? # ME: Accounting , yes . # ID: And I'm Christine , and my role in this scenario is to be the industrial designer . # PM: Industrial designer . # ID: But I'm not really one . # PM: So who is marketing , nobody in the market # ME: Marketing is , is me . # PM: So thanks for coming for the meeting first of all , and we have a long time , just twenty-five minutes to discuss about this project and the project initiation . # PM: First of all I want to ask Mister Ed about your marketing plan and your product plan and # ME: Well I think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to market the product . # ME: We'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this . # PM: but do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or # ME: for the moment not yet . # PM: Oh for the moment not yet , okay , but what's your do you have some project plan , something with you or # ME: Good question . # ME: this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there . # ME: We'll have to simply we'll have to work on it together . # PM: so by when you think you can give me some kind of project plan , okay , a discussion with # ME: Certainly by the next meeting . # PM: By next meeting , okay that will be great . # PM: so there's any questions or first of all about this project ? # ID: What is the goal of the project ? # PM: the goal of the project I think maybe I'll hand out to the Ed , okay , so to explain what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting . # ME: I'm in the sales I'm supposed to explain them what to do . # ME: We have to define exactly what our product is , from # PM: so can you explain what exactly the product is ? # ME: From what I had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee , is that right ? # PM: Oh I think , if I'm not wrong , we're making the remote control . # UI: I was wondering # ME: Remote controls , 'cause I had two different things . # ME: I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television , and afterward I had a discussion about coffee so we'll start with the remote control for television then . # ME: So we're have to design something that is very user friendly . # ME: Something visual that has something that will draw people to buy the product , because I think everybody's experienced with remote controls , and some remote controls are worth throwing out the window . # ME: th most of them ar I don't know we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use , 'cause a lot of times spend half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it . # PM: And what abo Christine , what about your the industrial design plan ? # PM: Are you have a design already on this product or you're still working on the design ? # ID: no , I have not begun working on the design , I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control , I thought we were designing a new monitor . # ID: the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a some sort of a seven inch monitor , and I understood that was the project goal . # ID: So I'm glad I didn't d do any work ahead of time because I clearly didn't understand the project goal . # ID: I just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people , and that's about that's and I read through the different steps , and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps . # PM: So you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team , for the design ? # ID: for the industrial design ? # ID: well , I would th think that depends on how much money you give us . # ID: because , you know , you can you can make it you have different choices with different financial models . # PM: , but before we talk about the finance , okay , do you have some idea how we can sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and of course it's to the individual also . # ID: Well , you know , I kind of think that in general you have to do y you have to have something that's very fashionable , that's very attractive that people see and recognize its goal , and they immediately wanna have it have one of their own . # ID: So it would really would need to something like the iPod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly well , you know , I don't care what it does , just so it looks cool . # PM: but uh when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design ? # ID: Well , I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now and so I'll have to wait and see how those how those go . # ID: If they go quickly then it could be a month . # ID: If if I run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months . # PM: , but I need something in the writing , so like what's your functional design , what's your technical design , and how many people you need for this project , and what's the time frame you're looking , okay , and what is the budget , maybe initial budget you're looking , okay , and how is going to the market , okay , so you've had to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan , okay , when are you going to introduce , okay , and by the time you introduce the product and you know there would be a competition , okay , so I need some kind of uh the plan in the writing from you . # PM: Okay , and it's po # ID: And when would you like that ? # PM: B as soon as possible . # ID: well if we have enough time then d do you think two weeks is a is close enough ? # PM: Yes I think that would be good , because I need to go to the management and tell them what we are going to do , and what cost is , okay , and what's the time frame and what's the project plan , because without any documentations , I cannot go to the management and say , so we are going to do this and we need this much money , okay , so then it's difficult for me to say , okay , that's the reason I need some kind of plan from you , initially , okay , then we can have the further discussion again . # ID: are there other people who will be contributing to the plan ? # PM: Yes , of course , if you need some help , so let me know . # PM: So , who are the people you need from the marketing or the technical side or the administration point of view , okay , to add in any documentation , or some technical point of view , so just let me know so I can coordinate all the teams . # ID: Okay , I'll get back to you on that . # PM: And Ed so what's what do you think about this project for the remote control and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or the sales strategy ? # ME: Well not yet other than doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do , what they're building , their designs , their ideas , also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into . # ME: It should be a fairly large market because the number of people that the competition , th I agree it has to be something it has to be something new , it has to be something that draws people saying eh , I like this . # ME: Whether it works or not , they have to first say I like this , I like the design , and then it's gotta be simple to use . # PM: Yes , so what I prefer maybe you need to interact more with the Christine , okay , because you know what she is going to do it , okay , and you know how to sell it . Okay , because she is doing the design , but you are the core because you are in the marketing , okay , so because you need to sell and you're the responsible for the all the money , the finance , okay , tomorrow . # PM: So , what I prefer , okay , so you need to interact with the Christine more and within her team , okay , who is using the functional design or technical design , okay , and you need to come up with some kind of plan , okay , how we are going to do the your sales plan , okay , # ME: Do we already have a cost limit on this , th an idea of how much we want to market this for , how much it's gonna sell for , # PM: Th That that's # ME: that's up that's up to us to decide , eh ? # PM: Yes , that's you have to decide , okay , so the best thing is you both of the Christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost , and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay . # PM: Then we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company . # PM: Okay , of course it's of benefit for everybody individually . # PM: Okay , so I think it's maybe if we can give me some kind of your the sales plan , okay , including the technical what she's going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the proper project plan . # PM: Okay , and if you need any coordination in between compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors , okay , depends if you want to have some uh marketing plan or technical plan , okay , so you let me know . # PM: Okay , I can coordinate , # PM: or maybe , you are my coordinator , am I right ? # PM: Between all the coor # UI: Well , no , not exactly . # UI: I mean my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable , it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that . # UI: So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her , so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work , # PM: Th Christine , . # UI: and so it's sort of it's a loop that feeds in , but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position for it . # PM: , so basically you need to interact with Christine more , okay , for the user acceptability , okay , and the testing , okay , then you will # UI: Which will also feed into the marketing , because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users . # UI: So I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit . # UI: , and then I guess build the plan based on all of that , because I think you need to take all the factors into account . # PM: But what I request , okay , keep Ed in the loop , okay , in between your meeting and Christine meeting , because he should know what's happening . # UI: , we can C_C_ him on any discussions or documents that are passed around . # PM: Okay and please copy all the mails , okay , all the discussions to me , okay , so I need to submit to the management . # PM: So any questions for time being ? # UI: So , the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design , or # PM: To come up with the functional design and to discuss with Ed , okay , and how it's going to be work , and first of all with your user acceptance , okay , how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market , okay , so then we can discuss about further things . # PM: So , we'll meet when the we'll discuss on the further meeting . # PM: Thanks for coming . # ID: Would you mind at the conclusion of our meeting could you send us a copy of your slides ? # PM: Yes , I will . Yes . # UI: , that would be useful . # PM: I'll copy , le let us keep all the emails and all the copies , okay , share each other , okay , so you know everybody what's happening , okay ? # PM: And if anything you need anytime so please either you can call me , or just send me email , or just come and knock my door , okay , so I'm available here . # PM: Okay , thanks for coming and I wish you a nice time then . # PM: Okay , see you later . Bye .
# PM: Agnes , you can help me for the slide when welcome back . # PM: I hope you have a fresh head and a fresh time . # PM: How t now the meeting actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting . # PM: and we'll issue some information from all of you . # PM: And it's in the , I think , in the sharing folder . # PM: And I will invite the Christine and the Ed and Agnes to discuss about on the various subjects . # PM: can you go to the next slide ? # PM: the agenda of the meeting is opening . # PM: Then I'm going to talk about the project management , what I'm going to do , and , of course , I'm doing the project management and secretary both , to take the minutes of the meeting . # PM: And there are three presentations . # PM: One is new project requirements . # PM: And the second one about decision on remote control functions . # PM: And finally we are closing . # PM: and the meeting time will be forty minutes , so you have to be very quick . # PM: And I have come up with the management come with the new proposal , and I have to discuss a few points on this . # PM: both says new insights in the aim of your project . # PM: the one is the teletext becomes outmoded , okay because if because of the computer systems and the new technology . # PM: we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design . # PM: And the second one is about the remote control . # PM: Should be used only for the T_V_ . # PM: That's what our management says . # PM: And the third point , it's very important to establish our marketing or corporate image , okay , with this new project or new product . # PM: I will invite Agnes , can you go to the third slide ? # UI: this is the third slide . # PM: I'll invite Christine to discuss about the functional design . # ID: do you wanna open the # UI: . You're participant # ID: I'm number two . # UI: Do you want the mouse , or do you want me to # ID: I'll do the notes . # ID: So well I figured we should identify some user requirements , and from my experience , I wanna , and from research I did , the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button , you can't have like waffling on this point , you know . # ID: Really have It needs to be able y have to be able to find it . # ID: Because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them . # ID: since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product , thought we better look at things that are popular and ex go beyond those , and , as I said in the first meeting , and then we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in the construction , especially in the outside of the product so that it gives the appearance , and it is reliable , and so forth . # ID: I did a little history on the remote controls and when they were invented and so forth , I guess this guy Zenith created the Flashmatic , which I kinda like the idea , 'cause it made me think of um maybe the remote control made a big flash when you turn the T_V_ on and off , that might be interesting . # ID: it was highly directional flash light that you could turn the picture on and off , and the sound on and off , and change channels so I think those are still requirements we have today , fifty years later . # ID: And it was really a pioneering innovation , but it was sensitive to the sun , so that it would get would start off by the you'd get it would easily cause problems . # ID: I in addition to looking at the functional requir all these devices are examples of where mm they represent examples that are available today which I think the one in the middle is r really something to keep in mind . # ID: It'd be easy to find . # ID: And it would y you'd you could throw it at things if the T_V_ didn't turn on and off , you could use it for something else . # ID: And since I'm not really Industrial Designer , I didn't really know what to do with this slide . # ID: But I just took some different schematics and I put them into this , and I guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board . # ID: I don't know why we were asked to do this . # ID: personal preferences , I think we could I I'm really thinking outside the box here , and I think that we should consider perhaps having an a size a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference . # ID: So something that's very flexible and inflatable and then you could shrink it . # ID: I think it could either be you could go either one extreme , be very colourful , or you could make it clear , and kind of blend in with things , so you didn't have to have a problem with the th the decoration of the of the user's home . # ID: I think it needs to be waterproof , because sometimes they fall into cups and , you know , it might be out by the swimming pool or something like that . # ID: if you mi one of one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it's done its job or not , because half the time , I keep pushing on the remote control , and I don't know if it's actually understood my message , so I think it should give you some sort of an oral cue . # ID: And , course I never wanna replace the battery . # ID: those are my f preferences , and that's my presentation . # PM: let me interrupt you if you can add other facility , other feature , like unbreakable . # PM: because especially today , you know , you have the family and the kids , and the kids throw it and they play with their remotes # ID: Run over it with a car . # PM: Okay , so if you can add the feature , okay , for your fabric whatever in your outline design okay , with unbreakable , I think that will give a lot of advantage for our product , if I'm not wrong . Maybe you can add it in that . # ID: Good idea . Good idea , I'll very good . # PM: thank you Christine , and uh any questions or clarifications , or any discussion on the functional design ? # UI: Do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials ? # UI: 'Cause , for example , in the unbreakable thing , doing something plastic would be harder , whereas having something like , I dunno , steel or titanium isn't really economically viable . # ID: Titanium would be heavy , too , # ID: No , I haven't really I wanted feedback , I think we need to rate rank these , but we'll see what your personal preferences are and your thoughts . # UI: I just wondering whether that you had any sort of # ID: I like titanium . # UI: The marketing comes out . # ID: but who said who said we were , you know , nobody told me how mu what our financial objective is , so It'd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though . # PM: the I'm sorry because the last meeting we supposed to discuss about the financial thing . # PM: let me go quickly , maybe if I can go back . # PM: I know the project plan and the budget . # PM: So I can close this , not sure . # PM: So let me see where is this file . # UI: That's Christine's . # PM: This is Christine . # UI: And that's mine , I think . # PM: That's yours , okay . # ME: I don't know , I think verbally we can we can pretty much sell . # PM: I will I will send you a mail , The project may be the project aim , At the end of the day , the company wants to make at least the fifty million Euro . # PM: and of course the price will be very reasonable on the sales side . # PM: that maybe Eddie will talk to you about how much the price and what's how much its cost for the manufacturing and how much it's going to be we sell in the market . # PM: Then you can come back with your feedback . # PM: And I have one maybe the suggestion or opinion . # PM: This remote control , okay , it can be for like universal , to use for any T_V_ . # PM: and it will be slim , # ID: Might be hard to find , though . # PM: But let's try it , okay , with the different the designs , okay , the functional designs . # PM: any other questions ? # ME: from her side , I don't think there's too many more questions . # PM: Thank you Christine for time being , # ME: If you can come to the # PM: so then Ed , so can you tell about # ME: from the marketing , from the marketing side , just to give an idea what the management is looking for , I was looking for a remote control to have a s # UI: S 'scuse me for one sec . # ME: I have a sales price of twenty-five Euro , with a production price of twelve and a half Euro . # ME: For what I think from what we're trying to find , we're tr we're looking for , I don't think that price is exactly in the market . # ME: I'll explain myself here now in the sense that in a in the recent surveys , from the ages fr from fifteen to thirty-five , eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy . # ME: Twenty-five Euros , that's a preson reasonable price . # ME: That's a market price right now . # ME: Now if we're gonna take a risk , and push this up a bit , make it more expensive , but give them added things that they don't have now , then it w it could possibly sell . # ME: Obviously the risk is there . # ME: Too expensive , they're not gonna buy . # ME: But , I think there's one other thing interesting two things that are interesting is that from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group , which always spends more money on trendy new things , speech recognition is requested . # ID: Speech recognition? . # ME: And we're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote . # ME: Obviously , we can't make a remote into a computer , but maybe simple commands . # ME: I dunno , louder , softer , on , off . # ME: That might be a possibility , even though it costs more , to be the first on the market to produce this . # ME: Thirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use . # ME: So we have to figure out a way of making it more user friendly . # ME: fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time . # ME: So maybe one word speech recognition commands , say remote , and there's a beep , and they can find it through , you know , ten tons of newspapers , magazines , whatever you have at home . # ME: But , in the cost that the management is looking for , that's not gonna be possible . # ME: But if it's trendy , if it's fancy , it's got some colour to it , if it's very easy to use , if it's got simple remote speech remote control , like I said , louder , softer , change channel , on , off , remote , it goes beep , I can find my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset 'cause I can't turn the T_V_ on . # ME: So we're gonna have to look at it in a in this global idea , with the ideas of the industrial design . # ME: But , price obviously we have to talk about . # PM: So what do you think about the design ? # PM: Do you think you can make it or # PM: What do you think about the design , what he was talking about of the speech recognition ? # ME: Speech recognition . # ID: training is always an issue with commands . # ID: we can perhaps do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process , it could reduce th the overall cost . # ID: But anyway , I think also that this might impact the battery life . # ID: maybe what we'll have to do is add something where you can recharge it wirelessly so that y you know sen send power to it . # ID: or maybe set it out in the sun and it , you know , gets , from the light , a solar cell inside there so that you have enough juice to do all these fancy things . # UI: It seems also like with the speech recognition , it's a great feature , but if you're watching T_V_ , there's a lot of ambient sound , and it's words . # UI: It's not just , you know , noises like something hitting . # UI: It's actual speech , so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the T_V_ speech , and the user's speech . # UI: Otherwise , you can say remote . # UI: But if someone on the screen is saying the same thing , all of a sudden , you have someone in a movie saying off and your screen dies , because they've triggered the remote control and it's turned off your T_V_ . # UI: So , I think if we can find a speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems , then , it'd be a really good marketing gimmick . # UI: But , I think we seriously need to consider how that would impact the situation . # ID: Very good point . # ME: Because tha w with speech recognition th I'm not that good at that idea if it's a one-word recognition , 'cause I know with telephones and cars and things I've seen in the States , a friend of mine says call Mom , and it calls up Mom . # ME: the radio can be on and everything . # ME: Because I think s with speech recognition , if the remote or like the telephone it has a exact word that it has to hear . # ME: I don't think it would come through a sentence in a television . # ME: If somebody's speaking on the se the television , they're not gonna stop and say remote , So I think that something could be designed to recognise single word # UI: I think it's a great idea if we can design it to suit those requirements . # ME: Like the t like the telephone . # ME: because I this is this is years ago in the United States where we're driving down and he said call home , and the telephone called immediately so well , that's kinda cute . # PM: what I can suggest to you , Christine , if you need some the technical feedback , or some training , okay , about this facility , especially for the speech recognition , I can recommend you some companies like Intel or I_B_M_ , because they're already in this speech recognition part , And you can maybe have some technical backup from them , some kind of a technical tie-up . # PM: and if you want , I can coordinate , okay , to get some information , and you can let me know , okay , so what kind of the details you require okay , to add this feature in this project . # PM: I don't think it's the difficult . # PM: we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop , apart from what today . # ID: we'll find that out . # ME: From from your side , you're gonna have to go back the management and s be more s precise . # ME: What do they want ? # ME: , a risk , take a risk on the market ? # ME: Something that's gonna cost more , but could very easily s make a boom in the market ? # ME: Because it has to be something totally different , has to be total totally new . # ME: Something that nobody has right now . # ME: And it's gonna cost . # PM: but end of the day , you're the sales guy , so I will come back and sit on your head because you are going to give your sales projection , It's of course it's good to tell the management how much it's cost us and how much you are going to benefit , # PM: I don't mind to convince , okay , the management to spend some more money on the project , okay , if you can make out of # PM: the money from this project . # ME: If the bottom line is positive . # PM: I don't mind to convince the management , The management says , okay , so they don't want certain facilities , which it's already worked , they want something new , I think like speech recognit definitely they will agree , I don't think they'll say no for that , And I hope I can convince the management on that , if you have any new ideas , okay , for your you can always come up and you can tell me if you need any s special , okay , coordination , okay , between any technical companies , which you can hide their technology backup , okay , for your functional design or technical design , then I am ready to do that . # PM: And what's your comments about # UI: well , I mean , maybe if I go through my presentation , you can sort of see what the user perspective is , and how it ties into the other two comments . # PM: so you are finish , Ed , so I can I'll hand over to Agnes . # PM: Just gonna close this . # PM: where are you , here ? # UI: Mm participant three . # PM: Participant three . # UI: , and that's fine . # UI: Okay . So , basically , the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products . # UI: So , in our case , existing remote controls . # UI: And then , what the good ideas are , and what the bad ideas are , and why they're bad and good , which isn't always as obvious . # UI: We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad , but when you look , technically , at how it works , sometimes that's not the case . # UI: Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep , 'cause that'll feed into both Ed's work and Christine's work . # UI: and then what the remote control should look like , obviously , once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are . # UI: in terms of the functionalities that we need , you obviously need to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off . # UI: You need to change channels , both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing . # UI: You need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the T_V_ to regulate contrast or whatever . # UI: the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls , in general . # UI: The buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do . # UI: often , you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done , which you don't necessarily always remember , especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often . # UI: And that the buttons are too small . # UI: here we've got two examples where here on the left-hand side , you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons . # UI: The buttons , in a lot of cases , are tiny . # UI: they're hard to see , and okay , they're labelled , but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much . # UI: Whereas , on the other side , you have a much simpler remote control that I think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed . # UI: And it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it . # UI: So , I would be inclined to go sort of towards this , in terms of design , rather than this . # UI: And if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing buttons . # UI: So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit , or to a minimum , make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed , so like the on button being really obvious one , the channel changing and the volume , and to keep the design basically sleek and simple . # UI: Which , I think ties into what Christine and Ed have both said fairly reasonably . # UI: that's pretty much it , I don't know if you guys have any questions or # ID: it's , seems very understandable . # ID: Clearly your research and ours heading in the same direction , the only thing that I saw missing from your research that we found was this ability to find the doggone thing when you need it . # UI: Yes , that's true . # ID: So , you know , but that's okay . # ID: That's why we're all here at the table , so that if we think of it and our research indicates certain things and w we it's complementary . # ID: I also think that th f the feel of it is , when you hold it , is something that was expressed more in my design and that's logical and normal 'cause those are the parameters that an Industrial Designer's more thinking about , th the look and the feel , and , you're # UI: that's definitely a very important factor , especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing and then using it almost on an daily basis in a lot of cases , I think . # ID: so I don't have any questions . # PM: for anybody need any help , for time being , on this subjects , okay , so please come back to me , and Christine , maybe I can try to help you to get some the technical the companies to help you for make a design slim , and to add some features , like we are talking about , the speech recognition and all . # UI: Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include , 'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table , do we actually want to incorporate all of them , or have we missed anything ? # ID: Do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide , maybe that would provide some guidance ? # ID: Doesn't really tell us . # PM: not really this one we are talk ab # ME: Individual actions . # ID: it says individual actions , it says user interf so I'm supposed to do the components concept , supposed to work on the user interface concept , and you're supposed to keep watching the trends . # ID: and specific instructions will be sent by our coach . # ID: I think we should do as many features as start with all of them right now # ID: and eliminate them later in the process , that's my suggestion . # PM: that will be great . # PM: And I'll send you the minutes of meet # ID: You can object if you want to # UI: I I'm just thinking in terms of time , # ME: She's objecting . # UI: like if Yes , now I'm objecting . # UI: I was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away ? # UI: I mean , it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features , and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use , maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want , # ID: I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting , # ME: th we s we still have # ID: 'cause w our meeting time has run out . # ID: Somebody else has go to use this room , and , you know , we can't hang out here and talk about this , so # PM: what we'll do is now we'll take for lunch break , then we can discuss furthermore , okay , with our areas , and then we will come back again in the in the next meeting . # PM: So thanks for coming and I'll send you minutes of meeting , and please put your all information in the sharing folder so everybody can share the information . # PM: So let's go for lunch then . # ID: Thank you very much .
# PM: welcome back after lunch , I hope you had a good lunch together . # PM: For this meeting the main agenda okay to discuss about the conceptual design meeting . # PM: Okay and the agenda will be the opening and that's the product manager or secretary that's me and the presentations from the Christine and Agnes and from Mister Ed . # PM: And finally in this meeting we have to decide and we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and the functional design So we have forty minutes , I think it's little bit low , but I hope we can finish it up so I'll handle to the functional team , to the Christine , okay , to discuss about the components concept . # ID: So , if you could open the PowerPoint presentation . # ID: I'm number two . # PM: You're number two . # ID: Components design , there we go . # ID: So can we put it in slide show mode ? # ID: Right here , is that little that one , yes please . # ID: I'll take the mouse . # ID: we were looking he specifically at the components the following components , the case , the power supply , the means of communications with the television set . # ID: In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition , you have to have microphone well no you don't actually I haven't have to have microphone in the device , maybe you do have it a way it has to it has to hear the speaker so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , but somewhere you have to put the microphone , and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost . # ID: so the other w thing that we So . # ID: Our method for going about this is we've looked at the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't and then we also we wanted to evaluate some new materials and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , this is the approach that we took during our research . # ID: So for the case , we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design . # ID: Course , you know , I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but that doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can we can really seriously explore , so then we were thinking about rubber , but unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat factor and th there might be some problems with the m how it's goes with the board . # ID: and then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after a while , so we still had titanium and wood available , but unfortunately uh titanium's also been eliminated , the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium , although how Apple did it with th PowerBook I'm not su quite sure nevertheless they've eliminated all of our options except wood . # UI: At least it's environmentally friendly . # ID: So , this is our finding . # ID: And a as she said , it's an environmentally friendly material , so we're currently proposing , we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second . # ID: So then there's this other matter of the chips and well we could use a simple design on the board , these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much intelligence with this simple one . # ID: And then there was the regular which I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one . # ID: the other option was this advanced chip on print , and we liked th we found that it includes this infrared sender , which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip . # ID: And manufacturing has told us that they've recently developed a sensor and a speaker that would be integrated into this advanced chip on print , so we now jumping right to our personal preferences I I'd really think we should , you know , use some of some really exotic woods , like , you know , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . # ID: I think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a this three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then I think we should go with the solar cells as well as the microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . # ID: So this is the findings of our research and my recommendations for the new remote control w would be to have it be made out of wood . # ID: Do you have any problems with that ? # PM: Can you go back one slide ? # ID: I'm not sure , how do I Oh , I know , let's see . # ID: Let's go back up here . # PM: question , what's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ? # PM: What's the meaning of that ? # ID: I think it's um a multiple chip design and it's maybe printed on to the circuit board . # ID: I could find out more about that before the next fi next meeting . # PM: is it means it's on the is it on a micro-proc micro-processor based or # ID: I don't know , but I'll find out more at our next meeting . # PM: Okay , tha that would be great , so if you find out from the technology background , okay , so that would be good . # UI: Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ? # ID: Because it gets brittle , cracks We want we expect these remote controls to be around for several hundred years . # ID: Good ex Good expression . # ME: good expression . # ME: Well after us . # ID: I don't know , speak for yourself , I'm planning to be around for a while . # UI: Although I think I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems , wouldn't you , I mean it chips , it if you drop it , it's I'm not su # PM: So so you're not convinced about the wood , yes . # ME: Actually , I'm ready to sell it . # UI: I think if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work , # ME: I'm ready to sell it . # ID: And you could you could sell oils with it , to take care of it . # UI: but you can't just use # ME: No y no , the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood , # ME: but there are some very pretty woods out there . # ID: Well I'm glad you # ME: That's actually very innovative idea . # ID: Sorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face . # ME: Well , it's actually a very innovative n different idea that you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood . # ME: I mean it's each person is gonna have their own personalised , individualised speech recognition remote control in wood , that's not on the market . # PM: , so it it's looks good the design the functional design , what about yo you ? # UI: in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own # PM: Yes , in t yes , in term in terms of comments first # ME: In turns of wow . # ID: She works in the cubicle next to me so she's she was already a little bit prepared for this . # ID: Luckily Ed was not . # UI: I think we can get the quality materials then it shouldn't influence the design principles too much , which you'll see with my presentation . # UI: One thing we'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having # ID: you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your # UI: have to see how kid-friendly it is and all that , # ID: It's really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it for teething . # ME: They do that anyway with the rubber and plastic , # ID: , they do it with other materials as well , . # ME: so , and chew 'em up . # ME: And chew 'em up . # PM: Okay then , let's move to Agnes . # PM: S you're You are in participant three . # UI: One point three , # UI: , that's the one . # UI: So , it's a very short presentation , 'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , which basically shows , sort of I took the ideas that we were talking about last time and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . # UI: And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control . # ID: my hand is different size than yours for example . # UI: So , that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability . # UI: , one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones , so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a T_V_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off . # UI: And also you had issues with the batteries running out , so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die . # UI: And in terms of invisible features , audio and tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition . # UI: So , in terms of what this thing would actually look like Despite working in interface design , I'm not the greatest artist in the world , so you'll have to forgive me . # UI: You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . # UI: And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . # UI: And then here you'd have your sort of standard , telephonish number pad . # UI: And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your T_V_ and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . # UI: So that if the user doesn't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you . # UI: , so again you can have a little L_C_D_ light somewhere , the flip thing and Have I forgotten anything ? # UI: I don't think so . # UI: So , as you can see , it's a very simple design , which is one of the things I really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . # UI: Think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different . # ID: Be like a copper hinge or you know . # UI: But you also have to d start watching out for the weight , 'cause depending on how much the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don't want it to start getting too heavy . # UI: But that's the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else . # UI: As you can see , there's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably , you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences . # UI: So , that's pretty much all I had to say , I mean , everything else in terms of design issues . # UI: the centering of the key pad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the volume control and the browsing more than the actual number pad , so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control , the number pad a little bit lower 'cause it's used less frequently . # UI: So once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , but more or less I think it should go along those lines . # PM: So what's your , the comments or s # ME: Simple design . # ME: It's what consumers want . # ME: It's almost like , Houston , we have a product here . # ME: Problem is obviously gonna be cost . # ME: I also have a f very simple presentation , because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want . # ME: I also have copied a different type of remote . # ME: If you can find me , where I'm at . # ME: There should only be one in here . # ME: It's being modified . # ME: They're stealing our product . # ME: We've been giving simple questionnaires in different areas because th obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today , 'cause trends change very quickly . # ME: In six months maybe this idea is already gone out the window , so it's gonna be a question how fast we can act . # ME: they already erased the rest of mine , huh . # ID: f go to findings . # ME: 'Cause I had another comment there . # ME: the market trend . This is what we know from the last from the questionnaires from the all the p surveys we've done , fancy and feel-good , that's what we've been looking for , something that feels good in the hand , that's easy to use . # ME: Looking for next generation of innovation , because all the remotes out there now , they're all very similar , they all do the same thing , we have to have something completely different . # ME: Easy to use , has always has become has become another major interest that , with the whiteboard we can see that it's a remote that's easy to use . # ME: And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . # ME: So even if we have a product that may be more expensive , if it comes out right , if they look it looks and feels good and has technology . # ME: The second two , you can see the last one is a very easy simple design . # ME: The second one , there is about forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , very hard to use . # ME: The first one , I see that they put in a display . # ME: Now there's something else with the little flip-up , now we're adding all kinds of things in , but with the little flip-up , if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked . # ME: Maybe the display also makes it easier to use , because sometimes when you're looking for buttons , maybe if you see a display # ID: Context-sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ or something else is in . # ME: Because I've seen mostly the standard ones , # UI: Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and # ME: Now you have it now you have one with the very simple also . # ME: The idea is simple , but with a display , so you can see what you're doing . # ME: So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use , trendy , fancy , feels good , with a display , wood , designer wood , designer colours # ID: You know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like a b some sort of a foam rubber ball , # ID: and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand . # UI: , so it's really molded to your specific # ID: then you would know like what the geometry of their hands would be and # ME: How hard they squeeze ? # ID: you'd know what kind of wood to get . # ME: Resistance resistance , right . # UI: But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote . # ID: That's right , that's right , you wouldn't wanna go too far down that . # ID: Oh that actually would increase the revenues we could expect , . # ME: No , but incorporating the three obviously it'd be something totally new on the market , totally different and from # UI: Well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick . # ME: Although , what it was it was Nokia that came out with this changeable colours . # ME: Right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face # UI: And that took off , . # ME: and then they sold millions , millions . # ME: So say with the f with the findings , with the research , easy to use something totally new . # ME: We have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market . # ID: We'd also have to wor consider that who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , we might wanna learn about labour laws . # ID: You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap , but you don't wanna exploit labour in third world countries . # ID: So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're par the reason the cost is high for the device is because you're paying a working wage to the person who made the device . # PM: , but we can get a production in , countries like , India # ID: Cost of living is low . # PM: yes , yes , countries like India or China or Malaysia , so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more . # ID: well th that'd be something that manufacturing would have to explore more and to where # ME: Where w Where it would be manufactured is another step . # ME: We're here to design , come up with a nice product . # PM: but that we can that we can talk about the production later , okay , depends on the quantity , okay . # PM: So we don't need to have our own fabric factory or something , so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric , okay , for the different electronics items , then we can have a business tie-up and to get to cut the cost , okay , to sell more . # PM: but le let's decide first about the components concept and interface concept , okay , if is acceptable for both of you , what Ed was talking . # PM: And your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so # UI: I think it depends , I mean I think it's a good idea , but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display right in front of you . # UI: So , if we're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go . # UI: I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for very specifically what it would be used for , 'cause if it's only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go , but that's just sort of speculation , I mean . # ID: What do you think Ed ? # ID: he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , do you know how much it costs , to add a little display like this ? # ID: Do you wanna take an action item to go find out ? # ME: no p spec It's 'cause we have to find out cost on it . # ID: Sorry about that . # ME: , no that's no problem . # ME: I'm here for the pushing it after it's made . # ME: I will market it . # ME: Once we get a price on it then we can market it . # ID: So the advanced chip on print is what we've deci we've determined and the engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding this concept of a wooden case . # ID: A customisable and # ME: Nice beautiful mahogany red wooden case . # UI: What about the buttons , would Would the buttons be wood too , or # ID: I don't think so , no , # PM: I don't think so . # ID: I think they could be rubber like they are now , so you have that tactile experience of # PM: Don't looks nice . # PM: what we'll do is , we will stick with the simple design for time being until th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra , in case we go for the display . # PM: Okay . So maybe what you can do is , both of you , you can come up with the prototype , okay , the model . # ID: are we done with this meeting ? # PM: is it okay if they will come up with the prototype design , okay . # PM: Then they can show you how it looks like , and then we can submit to the I will submit to the management . # PM: Then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it's cost as extra for the display . # PM: An and the marketing strategy , that's very important , okay . # ID: And a marketing strategy . # ME: And marketing strategy , thank you . # PM: How much you can how mu how much how much you can sell extra . # PM: Of course you'll make money too , so it it's not only pay-out , you make money too , your commission . # PM: Okay , so , any questions ? # PM: So , by next meeting , so , please come up with the prototype , okay , then , then we can proceed from there . # PM: So thanks for all your efforts and coming for the meeting again , and see you soon then .
# PM: Welcome back . # ID: I'm sorry to be late . # PM: Welcome back everybody . # PM: So this meeting agenda will be the detailed design meeting . # PM: And opening and P_M_s of the meet minutes , prototype presentation from Christine and Agnes . # PM: and evaluation criteria . # PM: The finance , it's from my side , from the management , and production evaluation . Then closing . # PM: So we have forty minutes to discuss and finalise and close the product and project and to move further , okay , Okay , let's talk about maybe first for the prototype . # PM: So I handle to # UI: I've done a presentation , but it pretty much covers work that we've both done , so if I'm missing anything , Christine can just correct me . # PM: So shall I go to # ID: thank you , so you did a PowerPoint presentation , good for you . # PM: Okay , let's go to A_M_I_ . # UI: It's not the biggest PowerPoint presentation in the world , but # PM: So in two or three or # ME: Probably . Technical pa I would think . # UI: think it's the last one . # UI: then this is the la , that one , final design . # UI: It is named appropriately , you just couldn't see the name . # UI: okay , can I have the mouse ? # UI: Alright , so from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and the colour would be customisable , 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour . # UI: so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it's too expensive , well then you just take it off . # UI: to unveil our lovely product . # UI: This is our remote control , with the flip panel as you can see . # UI: So if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display . # UI: , this is actually hard to do . # UI: The yellow button you have is the on off button , so it's really big , hard to miss . # UI: You have the red triangles are the toggles for changing the volume . # UI: So up volume up , down volume down . # UI: The green are the channel changing . # UI: S And it's one of those very light , very touchable displays . # UI: And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the T_V_ , and on the left-hand side you have the ability to turn off the voice recognition . # UI: So this is pretty much what we had on the white board the last time . # UI: Additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front . # UI: So that you can really make this a highly customisable remote control . # ID: We haven't specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed . # ID: That depends on the s design of the circuit board inside and what room is left # PM: I think the microphone is on the top , on the middle , the under the flip . # PM: So that will be the safe , so p any the chip it's not on the chip because you need to have microphone to # ID: No , I mean it depends on the design of the circuit board . # UI: But it shouldn't be under the flip either , because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice . # PM: it's my opinion I think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to the talk , okay , so then you can speak then you can close it . # PM: But if you put it on the on the flip , okay , then technical I don't think it's feasible , 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised . # UI: But if you've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice , why use the voice , why not just use your hand ? # UI: I mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and I'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up , I can just use my voice . # ID: Maybe I've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and I'm holding my cup of Coca-Cola in the other hand . # UI: And you don't wanna let go of either one . # ME: I don't wanna say . Louder . # UI: I mean it doesn't have to be on the flip , it can be on the side somewhere . # ME: Can also be on the side . # PM: , the sides maybe is good . # UI: So , I mean I can pass this around if anyone wants to # PM: Yes . So it's maybe good idea . # ID: , y better you pass it around with a napkin . # ME: No , because y you can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem would haven't been not be damaged or anything , and it'd be accessible all the time to voice . # PM: So it's maybe good idea . # ME: Compliments to the artist . # ID: You need to work on the weight a little bit . # PM: I'm fine , I'm satisfi # UI: And maybe the shape of the buttons , # PM: I'm satisfied . # UI: the little egg shapes aren't the most economical , but # ID: We're glad you're satisfied . # PM: Of course it's looks more heo heavy , but I think when it's completely maybe it's a less weight . # UI: I mean this is plasticene . # UI: There's only so much you can do . # UI: We could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well . # UI: And part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light , because they don't feel like they have enough control over it . # UI: So I mean maybe this is excessively heavy , but I think it needs to have some weight , it needs to feel like you're still holding something . # UI: So that's pretty much it for our presentation actually . # PM: That's your prototype model ? # PM: Okay , that's good , thank you very much . # PM: So any comments or # ME: Well , the prototype is very well within the design and ideas that we've talked about on the previous meetings . # ME: Now it goes into this next phase as the financial marketing # PM: Yes , that So I'll come back to the So evaluation criteria , I think that will be good , so then let's come to the finance , I have some calculations which I made as for the budget . # PM: So here you can look like the energy and dynamo and kinetic and solar cells . # PM: it's optional , somewhat optional and Ed wants the chip on print , that's what we were talking about that . # PM: So then we have sample sensor and sample speaker , then we have the wood material , then special colour and push button . # PM: actually , our budget was twelve point five Euro , but it's coming to nine point nine five Euro , so we are under below the budget , okay , so still we are saving some money . # PM: I think it's a good figure . # ID: Yes , great I I'm surprised . # ID: Congratulations . # PM: Than thank you . # ME: Well we haven't come to mine yet , so # ID: Oh , okay . It's gonna cost a long way to c you know , cost a lot of money to market it , is it ? # ME: we're gonna have a bit of difference of opinion , yes . # PM: So maybe it's for some money we can utilise for our marketing , for the sales , okay , and # ME: Well , it just depends on if we're gonna add a o on this pr provisionary cost analysis , we do not have a L_C_ display . # ME: L_C_ display is gonna be very expensive , # UI: No we do , but it's not filled in . # ME: It's not it doesn't say . # UI: It's number thirty . # ME: We don't have the price up there , # UI: you're right , sorry , yes . # ME: okay , so if we add approximately two to three Euro per remote , now we're up around about twelve , twelve and a half as to what the company had initially requested . # ID: So that means we can put the L_C_D_ in , . # ME: But as far as production I'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also , and in mine you'll see the problem with our survey , the p the possibility that how many units can be sold , what percentage of the market , etcetera because that has to be taken in into consideration . # ME: this is just production cost , it is not advertising cost , it's not transportation cost # PM: Yes , so still we have twelve point five Euro . # ME: And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the cost of the unit for the company . # ME: So to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit , we're gonna have to go a long ways . # PM: This we are talking about one unit , okay , so when it go into the quantity , okay , and the cost will come down . # ID: Although customisation , because this is being done , you know , the on on-order basis , it might be the quantity won't m won't # ME: It's gonna be very hard to reduce . # ID: the circuit board will b you're right , would be in producing quantity , but the cost of the case would be fixed at the you got some pretty cheap labour that can do this case for one Euro . # ME: That's not bad . # ID: That's really that's the cost of the material and lab wow , that's really outstanding . # PM: But anyhow , still we are under control , okay , so what I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors , okay , to get the production cost less , okay , so then we can save some money , okay , to put into th our marketing or you know the promotions , whatever , okay , so that I will look after . # PM: I will speak to the management and how to get you know some more cost down . # ME: If we can go to my display . # ME: And we'll come back to yours just to give everybody an idea of the market . # ME: So now I'm gonna scare everybody out of this project . # ME: If I'm still here . # PM: You're in four ? # ME: The four gives me it's gotta be TrendWatch . # ID: Is this the same one you did before ? # ME: It shouldn't be # UI: That's no , I think it's the same one . # ME: if it's not it's not the right one . # ME: No , no we g no , that's the same one . # ME: You have to go back and find another one . # ME: Whatever name it popped up under . # ME: functional , try functional , it might not be it either , but we'll see . # UI: It looks like it , there's # ME: So we'll go screen by screen . # ME: Although since we need to have some type of idea on a market we had independent study that says it this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year . # ME: Our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which is approximately the same as the independent study . # ME: So if we continue , we'll look at the findings . # ME: Which means that if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year , which is actually a tremendous amount . # ID: Mayb maybe they already expected something . # ME: if we put an inflated price of fifty Euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five Euro , okay , we're already in that price , okay , with transport , promotion , labour , because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost , transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our retailers . # ME: Twenty-five percent of the market to get to two million units . # ME: At two million units , we have to have a profit of twenty-five Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit . # ME: So , obviously we w I just did a run down the evaluation of the form , the fan the fancy stylishness of the of the unit , the ease of use , speech recognition , cost , we've gone through these . # ME: Now , the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production . # ME: Or we project this over two years , but being that the market changes very quickly , maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now . # ME: So , now we have to come up with a decision . # ME: Can the company sell two million units ? # ME: Can it sell it for fifty Euros ? # ID: Could could I go to findings ? # ID: I would like to explore the possibility of using alternative delivery and sales channel which would be to use the internet for promotion and ordering # UI: I was thinking the same thing , . # ID: and then to drop-ship the p product to the customer's residence . # ID: That way you have no storage , you have no you do have transportation , still have the labour cost , but you don't have the transport to the point of sale . # ID: The point of sale is online . # PM: To the agents . # UI: You can do a shipping centre somewhere , or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs . # ID: Right , like Amazon . # ID: In fact , we should sell through Amazon , # ID: don't you think ? # ID: There's an idea . # PM: , that's a good idea . # PM: To impro more profit and # ME: S Upscale technology . # ID: , we we're do you know , selling a unique product . # UI: That actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable , 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have , see maybe what other people have done , what the range of possibility as , # ME: There are several companies that have gone that way . # UI: whereas if you're in a store , you can't unless you're a highly imaginative person , you may not really know what it is you want , whereas on the web , if you have a bunch of pictures , it can sort of trigger ideas and # ID: And you can even have an a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di the only thing that you're missing really is the weight . # UI: The weight and feel . # ME: Weight , the feel of the product , but # ID: We're getting used to that . # ID: It's not quite like trying on a shoe , but people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying . # ME: There are several that have gone through with the watches , too . # ME: You can customise a watch , you can see how it is at the f at the end of the production , you can change it There's a lot of online that's that is doing this now . # ME: And when you're rotating , you'll look behind and look this way it's possible to do with this , maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year , which could you know , feasibili feasibility lower the price of the unit . # PM: I don't think that's not possible , okay then , l let's wait for the production , okay , then you can evaluate the product , so how it looks like technically and how it look like the real . # UI: What turnaround time do we have ? # UI: 'Cause I mean production evaluation can be very quick or very long . # PM: Yes it's very quick , of course . # PM: It will come back in two weeks , okay , it will be ready in two weeks . # PM: For evaluation , okay . # ID: Prototypes , you mean . # PM: Yes , the prototype product evaluation . # ID: We probably should do some market tests once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it . # ME: Well , obviously . # ME: Mm that'd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea , # PM: So you can take a minimum two weeks to a maximum four weeks . # ME: to see get their # UI: Think minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use it's not a trivial task . # PM: , because we are not going to do it in our factory , okay , so we can give it a product evalua # UI: We definitely shouldn't do it in our factory . # PM: So we'll do it in the other place , and I don't think it's take more than four weeks time . # PM: Okay , so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation , okay , then it's approve from the technical team and your team , okay , from the management , then we can launch in the market . # ID: Any outstanding ? # PM: S Any any other questions or comments to be discuss ? # ME: I think we pretty much covered everything . # ID: Did you have something ? # UI: Well I was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad , this is bad , we want this done differently . # PM: Okay , let's take like this . # PM: Let's proceed with this model , okay , for the for the marketing direction , okay . # PM: So no more changes will be made , okay , in this the basic design . # PM: So we will introduce m this model and let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers , then we can go for the # ID: Second generation . # PM: second generation . # PM: Okay . There's no end , there's not limit . # UI: The problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of . # PM: Every every custom # ME: Well , then it may not be . # PM: Well , every customer , okay , they have their own ideas , they have their own test , okay , so there's no end , there's no limit . # ME: Like people don't like wood . # UI: No , but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up . # ME: very specific . # PM: , so that's the reason you are here for the design , okay , I hope you made a good design . # UI: Yes , but I'm not everybody . # UI: I mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need . # UI: We have our own motivations in mind , we have our own ideas in mind , but that doesn't mean that that's what's gonna sell . # PM: , but see , we ought to take a few considerations , okay , one is the price consideration , one is future consideration , okay , like you can eat you can all eat more chi I can eat more chilli , okay , so i it's a depends on the individual taste , you know , so we have we have to balance somewhere . # UI: I'm just trying to point out that I think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short well you have no redesign not you personally , but in the project we have no redesign time and # ID: Our project doesn't Ed , d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for T_V_ remote control sales ? # ID: Would it be the Christmas season by any chance ? # PM: The sports time . # ID: Sports season . # ID: Which sport season ? # ME: Right before the Eur the World Cup . World soccer . World Cup soccer , # ME: they need those things that they have their hands g occupied and they need to be able to talk to the con remote control . # ID: maybe what So I think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the launch of a user-tested device with some special event . # UI: , that's a good idea . # ID: so that gives us a little more time perhaps then we anticipated , because I don't know when the World Cup is , but I'm sure there's gonna be one . # ME: Or any major sports . # ID: Or another m major sports event . # ID: Probably not the football games coming up the end of January . # ID: I think that might be a little too aggressive , but , so , I'm just ig pointing out a strategy to do some additional user testing # ID: pri and then to launch at a major sports event or perhaps to also # UI: That's actually good place to advertise it too . # ID: And to work with motion pictures . # ID: There might be some motion pictures that are coming out that are coming out on D_V_D_ that they need to have a m special remote control to work with it , so we could maybe work out a campaign with Sony Pictures for example . # ID: Maybe some management has got relationships there we can leverage . # PM: Yes , the that of course I will convince the management to do that , okay . # UI: It's just something to keep in mind , 'cause it's really important . # PM: Sure , sure , yes . # UI: A lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped , when in fact it gets re-released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy . # ID: Disposable diapers is an example of that in fact . # ID: it is one of the first consumer products that was launched about thirty years that was a disposable consumer product , # UI: That I didn't know . # ID: and people the market hadn't really gotten on to the concept that you could use something and then throw it away , 'cause it wasn't but then when they re-launched them thirty years later , they were virtually the same design , but people had gotten the throw-away , you know , paper cups and napki y all kinds of things that they hadn't so , you're right , timing is very important , but I think we've got a good product . # PM: That's the reason Ed is here . # PM: I think he can promote the brand value and the product value . # ID: It's gonna be very important to the company . # PM: We are behind the scene and he is the front screen , so . # PM: He's on the big screen . # ME: , I'm the one who takes the heat . # ME: If it's a flop , it's the marketer . # ID: You look very relaxed , considering h you know , the weight on your shoulders , . # PM: Okay , so then let's come to the closing and are the costs within the budget # ME: Celebration . # PM: and is the product evaluated , okay , so that will come soon . # PM: Okay for but our time being , so thanks for all your efforts and great work and great design and let's leave it to the Ed for later for once production is over and the meantime let's celebrate . # PM: So let's meet up this evening to hang up for some party . # ID: Nice working with you . # ME: Thank you very much . # PM: Thank you again for all . # PM: And see you in the evening for drinks . # ME: Yep , okay , see you later on .
# ID: Good morning . # PM: You have to put it exactly on the on the # UI: Good morning . # ID: Good morning . # PM: I took your mouse . # ID: Should I bring my pen too ? # PM: that's for me , I just have to make some notes . # PM: I got my mouse . # ME: I also forgot my mouse , but I don't need my mouse , I think . # ID: My laptop is crashing . # ME: Damn computers . # UI: Let's just check one more time . # ME: Can you hear me ? Hello ? # PM: actually my laptop doesn't work , switch it on again . # ME: Okay . I think it works . # ID: Yes , it's working . # PM: you all read what we are going to do or not ? # ME: We're gonna make a remote control . # ID: I think my laptop is a bit # PM: I just made a simple presentation . # PM: So you put some things in it . # PM: How does this work ? # UI: One most to the right . # ME: Press F_ eleven . # PM: Okay . So that's my name , . # PM: we're going to make a remote control , you already know that . # PM: Just have a look , are we going to this agenda of our meeting . # PM: You know , this is about twenty five minutes , this meeting . # PM: the thing we have to know is you already know what we're going to do , you also read what this the things or , not yet , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly that's what we're going to design . # PM: first we have uh three steps of making the remote control . # PM: Fir the first thing is th the functional design , that's very important . # PM: We have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and how the mm the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design , it's for the f next meeting . # PM: The the second thing is the conceptual design , that's what it that's the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . # PM: And we have to look what the market is doing for what kind of remote controls are in the market . # PM: And the third thing is the detailed design and that's exa you know what it is , it's exactly how it looks and whatever . # PM: Okay so no , this is a these are two smartboards , with the f s an introduction of that one . # PM: And you already saw you know all that you here can put things in the red project map . # PM: So no okay have a look at that one . # PM: Okay . So what we're going to do first is you can read . # PM: You have to draw a favourite animal on the whiteboard and say why it's your favourite animal . # PM: and you have this is just to try it out and we have to use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen . # PM: So okay , so first have to show you , maybe you can come here to have a look how it works . # ME: I can see it now . # PM: This a new page , it's okay . # PM: Use pen format . # PM: and a different colour can use here I just take the pink . # PM: You take there's no pink , okay , oh just purple , okay . # PM: line width ten . # PM: just take what I'm going to draw is an elephant . # PM: Just draw slowly , because otherwise it won't work . # PM: It's a very nice elephant , you can see . # PM: I dunno what it looks but it doesn't matter . # UI: Looks very nice . # PM: I just h Something like this ? # ME: It look like a dinosaurs . # UI: A pink elephant . # PM: Because I like Just takes so long , Whatever , You erased this one . # PM: It's a bit slow you can see , this is a bit annoying . # PM: Okay , so just for you guys just one of you can draw a painting if you want . # ME: Let me try one . # PM: just u use it like that , . That's okay . # ME: Mm . Okay and then what's the colour ? # PM: It's in format . # ME: I'll take this one . # ME: there has to be water , # PM: it has to be an animal , so if that's it's it should be a shna snake or something . # ME: but it's an animal it's an animal that lives in the water . # PM: Okay . Okay okay . Okay . # UI: The water is important . # ME: So I first draw the water . # ME: and now I make the animal . # ME: This is a worm . # PM: do you have to write down why that doesn't matter , just it's to get used to the whiteboard , but it's okay . # PM: Just make a new blank new blank page . # PM: not too far to the to the t pen top . # UI: let's make it a dog . # PM: Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back , so that # ME: I think it's a pig . # PM: we d only have twenty five minutes , # UI: I make a cat of it . # ID: I was gonna make a cat too . # PM: Use your fantasy . # UI: not too quick . # PM: Just hold it more to the back then you don't have # UI: I just draw too quick I think . # PM: that's okay , thank you . # UI: It's just to get used to it . # PM: I thought these pens would be just you write it down and you download it to Word , you already did it or no ? # PM: No , not yet , okay . # UI: but you actually got to write on the paper . # UI: You really got to write on that paper . # PM: but I d I thought it would be just in typed words in Word , # ME: it's a real pen . # UI: but it's just a picture . # PM: it's just a picture . # PM: it's not that cool as I th thought it would be . # ME: Y you can you can't edit in the edit it in Word . # PM: I don't know , what time did we start this meeting , I'm not sure . # UI: I think it was # ME: Half past ten . # PM: Now we just have to save everything , this is definitely the best one . # PM: Okay , so what we know is that we have to sell this remote control for about twenty five Euros . # PM: And we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros , so we have to use a big market in Europe . # PM: The production cost are about half the price of selling price , # UI: Piece of cake . # PM: can someone make a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , I dunno . # PM: we're gonna have a little discussion about what experience are with a remote control the and everything , so just have a look how it we think about remote controls . # ME: my first question was does it have to be a universal remote control ? # PM: that's a good question . # ME: Because we sell it uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it apart . # PM: I think it's I'm not I'm not sure , it's not mm I think # ID: , it probably would be universal . # UI: And only television ? # UI: Or more devices ? # PM: I don't think you can buy a universal remote control for twenty five Euros , not sure , # ME: I know you can buy a re a universal control for only twenty Euros # PM: we just say we just say that's universal remote control . # PM: Okay , perfect . # ID: And also for the V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ player # PM: , everything so a lot of buttons on the remote control . # PM: just everything . # PM: what what's a remote control , it's just a black thing with some buttons on it , it's not nothing very special , # UI: we can try to make it special . # PM: do you have any ideas how it has to look for usability or user # ME: I th I thought about making it the same style as the television , we don't have the same television all the time , so that's no matter . # ME: if we control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player with it has to be clear , because kids and elderly are gonna use it , it's not only for the technical persons . # ME: I think it must be a very good control , so you can uh act use it from everywhere in your room , the infrared thing must be from very good quality . # PM: That's right . Should be a good point . # ID: And how big should it be ? # UI: It shouldn't be too big , # UI: but I don't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think . # PM: Just big enough for the buttons we have , that's it . # UI: Or we have to make something like mobile phones that you can fold it opem . # UI: Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer , maybe more trendy . # PM: But you think about uh one you can fold open . # UI: Fold open , where you can see more options . I think # PM: Maybe for the D_V_D_ pla player or something , # UI: something on top , just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often . # ID: or you c O or you could th think of an uh a small touch screen on the remote control . # PM: Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ? # PM: There are buttons on it . # UI: you can make an manual in it . # ID: or maybe to keep it easy and small . # PM: But it's not t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it . # ID: like a to have # UI: , I think it's much too expensive . # ID: , maybe it would . # ME: but it's not reachable I think , touch screen . # ME: And we have to care for the strength of the remote control , because uh remote controls are most things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often broken . # PM: And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too fragile . # ME: and a lots uh lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not kids # PM: You can put games on your remote control . Whatever . # ID: And how about the batteries ? # ID: should you put it in a recharger or a just # PM: maybe that's a good idea , # ME: Ma maybe a home station . # PM: just to put it on your television and just s recharge , you never have to use any batteries . # UI: Maybe that's a good idea , but , we have to look at the price now I think . # PM: how m how mu how expensive is a normal recharger ? # UI: how much is your standards mobile phone recharger ? # ID: if you buy it separately from your phone it's probably expensive , but I don't know what the project projection costs are for such a thing . # PM: if you th look at the market , it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because maybe it's too expensive . # ME: but a home station is a really good idea , because lots of people are lose their remote control and don't know where it is , # ME: and now you can put it always at the same place . # ME: Maybe it's Therefore it's a good idea , but maybe it's expensive . # UI: Maybe use it as a separate option . Sell it separately . # ME: You can you can buy it with it . # ID: but I have a mouse that's uh also # UI: Rechargeable . # ID: and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station , or you can change your batteries , # PM: The option , just the option , that's cool . # ME: I set something on paper already , size , looks , usable , the buttons on usable places , the on off button must be on top , it has to lay good in the hand , you have to # PM: Has it be has does it has to b have to be like a different form than a normal remote control # ME: I don't I don't know I don't know # UI: I think we have to look at that , 'cause well you can do the standard way , but then you won't # ME: You can make it very special , to create our own looks , but it's very hard to # ID: if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works . # UI: you can have the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume obviously on t on top , so you can see . # UI: But the rest is you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well . # UI: So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think , so you can do something unique with that . # ID: And what we have to think about too is uh buttons that you use often are maybe like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you can still do the th the functions . # ME: what Paul already said . # PM: , just for the T_V_ and just the normal function , that's fine . # ME: on top are the basic options on top , # ID: basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so , # ME: and if you fold it open # PM: But maybe it's # UI: That's what I meant . # PM: maybe it's very hard to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh what's it's called ? # ME: Mm . If you if you make to fold open it's or also an the strength is not s as good as a normal remote control . # PM: Maybe it's hard t No , that's right . # PM: So maybe we have to keep it like mm a square , just normal remote control . # PM: Just think about it . # PM: We have to close this to finish this meeting , There's some more things . # PM: We have another thirty minutes , so then we're going to meet again . # PM: So you know what you have to what you have to do ? # ME: for m for me the Marketing Expert , the user requirements specification , do I need to think as a user , a as a only the looks and the # UI: what you want to do with it . # PM: I think this if you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_ , a D_V_D_ player , all that things . # PM: Also from a user , but all these things together . # ME: it's also about strength and for everything . # UI: I also wrote down some stuff that you want on a # PM: no maybe not , that's not a f that's something for . # UI: Technical fun fu # PM: That's not for you . # PM: Just if what's in the market , what's normal , what kind of buttons do you have . # UI: What do you want to do with your remote control , what do you need on your remote control . # UI: I already wrote some down , some ideas . # UI: There's already a document in the folder about it . # PM: see you in thirty minutes . # PM: For the next time you have to put it exactly on the square , so your laptop . # UI: It didn't say that .
# PM: I just forgot their name , I just forgot them all . # PM: I have to write it down . # PM: Do you know them # ME: For for my sur # PM: but your b your surname . # ME: M_ . I mean M_ . Double M_ . # PM: And what's your name ? # UI: Paul Wiezer . Paul Wiezer . # PM: What's your name ? # PM: but your surname . # PM: Your surname . # ID: Abbing . A_ B_ I_ N_ G_ . # ID: I was a little short on time , # PM: No no , I just fi first my # UI: Which one was mine ? # PM: let's have a look , we have forty minutes , so it's more than enough . # PM: Okay , perfect . # PM: we have what's that ? # PM: we have forty minutes for this for this second meeting , and we have to make sure that we going t that we are sure , that we are , that we know what we're going to make th what the product is going to like look like . # PM: first I have the notes of the last meeting , so I showed show them to you . # PM: Oh , sorry about that , I just escape this one . # PM: How do I escape this ? # PM: How do I escape this s presentation ? # PM: And show , Okay , so let's have a look s at this one . # PM: Okay , so the f the f the points we had last meeting was the Should be a univ universal remote control that's I s I just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a T_V_ remote control only . # PM: have you changed that part ? # PM: it still has to be f a r a remote control for kids and elderly . # PM: It's it's still the same . # PM: All these points we have to look at . # PM: You all know them . # PM: But there's another point . # PM: The the main people of interest of this company are forty plus people . # PM: So they're old and not younger people . # PM: So we have to look at that as well . # PM: 'Specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something , I dunno . # PM: , that's it , so just you can do your presentation # UI: Which one first ? # PM: Oh it doesn't matter , just start with the # UI: Functional requirements , # ME: Okay . Well my name is Jens Damman , but we're in a group , and I will start it . # ME: I've used a marketing report on the site . # ME: I think you've read it too . # ME: and f and furthermore I surfed the o the other site . # PM: I didn't read i read it , it's not for me , # ME: You didn't read it ? # PM: I didn't get it anyway . # UI: I didn don't thing we got it . # PM: It's only for you . # ME: Oh okay , I was the only one who get it . # ME: it was uh um a report about an experiment with a lot of users . # ME: And they had a lot of findings in their report with statistical uh thing with statistical proof . # ME: I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of a lot of findings . # ME: So we can use this to create our own remote control . # ME: seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly . # ME: I think uh that's a lot , so we have to make a beautiful remote control . # ME: eighty percent of users would spend when a remote control will l look fancy . # ME: I think this fits at the what Michael said about older people . # ME: Older people will spend more money for something uh what's good . # ME: Because younger people are more critical about uh where they spend their money at . # ME: seventy five percent seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot . # ME: okay , that's normal . # ME: I think we have to make good zap buttons . # ME: But that's one of our requirements . # PM: The last point is quite an interesting # ME: fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . # ME: Martijn alr already said it . # ME: And maybe our fold open system is a good one , I don't think it's # PM: we should have the ten percent on the on the top , # ME: , the ten percent on the top , . # ME: That that's a good one . # ME: Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . # ME: That's exactly what we said about maybe a home station for it to recharge the batteries or something . # ME: I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , so when you clap your hands it will beep or something . # ME: you must find it quickly . # UI: Maybe just a button on the home station . # UI: So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station . # ME: we can combine that . # ME: it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control . # ME: I think we must t take a look at this . # ME: It's only th thirty four of the thirty four percent . # ME: But it's a tough one . # ME: Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we c this is so difficult , a difficulty I think . # ME: next , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . # ME: , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something . # ME: I don't We we haven't we mustn't look too much at the last point . # ME: the last experiment was about gadgets , like speech recognition . # ME: We didn't think about that already . # ME: And an L_C_D_ on the remote control . # ME: We already thought about that . # ME: they finally had a conclusion that younger people under an age of f forty five are more interested in new features . # ME: but they're more critical . # ME: And older people want to spend more money . # ME: But they don't want to have a lot of new features , because they're in their old thinking way . # ME: And they want to keep the old things the old things . # PM: we have a new age of forty plus . # ME: But y But you but you already said that the company was about forty plus clients ? # PM: so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control , # ME: I think we can speak , we can skip speech recognition directly , # ME: because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros . # ME: I have my personal preference . # ME: that's not very good , because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ . # ME: I had a question about . # ME: But it's already out of the question , this . # ME: my point is , well , I If we ma make a remote control for only television , I think it's hard to sell it for twenty five Euros . # ME: But it's the exercise . # PM: Because it's too expensive . # ME: , only for television On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything . # ME: And we only make it for television , so we mi mm we m must made it make it very special . # UI: but good usability , so you can use it . # ME: I told about the home station . # ME: it must be simple , because our the elderly people needs to use it . # ME: And I found a motto . # ME: And we put the fashion in electronics . # ME: And that's the motto we are referenced to for our style . # ME: We we have to make a new product . # ME: We have to be . One of a kind , I think . # PM: So it has to look uh unique , # ME: The company is about our th their own fashion , their own style . # PM: But old people are not looking for that . # ID: I think the main thing is the usability , that's where we can make it a special product . # ME: to k to keep it simple when you # UI: But we also have to stand out , # ME: I thought about it , yes . # UI: 'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff . # UI: But we have to make sure that we're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it . # UI: So make it just a different colour or different shape , # ME: this was my presentation . # PM: Paul , you can do the next one if you want . # ME: You can ask some questions or something . # PM: It's on the on the net thing , # UI: Technical functions design . # UI: Okay , well , so we have s mm broad audience . # UI: Isn't that isn't true anymore . # UI: But we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple . # UI: the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen standard . So standardised methods like on all remote controls . # UI: Not too full , like Jens already said , only ten percent is being used . # PM: what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or # UI: I have it on the next page . # UI: But yes basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff . # UI: the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons . # UI: an icon on it or text on it , so it's very clear what that buttons does . # UI: So it doesn't take much time to figure out how to use it . # UI: a way to find out what people use is maybe just to use questionnaires on the internet or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control to find out . # UI: But there is already in a one done . # UI: Of functions I could think of . volume , channels , the basic according to . Just one two three etcetera . text service options . basic on-off . # UI: And I found an Could I think of favourites ? # UI: I always look up the same pages on text and always have to click the number . # UI: But if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button and you get on your # ID: but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel . # ID: So you might as well remember the number . # PM: Maybe i maybe it's too complicated , but not sure . # PM: It's a good idea , # UI: It was just a thought . # UI: I would find it handy , I think , when you just press one button and you get on six . # ID: But how can you remember what channel connects to what favourite button ? # UI: what I was reading on the page . a remote control just sends commands , basics commands to the television . # UI: switch to channel six . # UI: button six says six . # UI: And if you make favourites , it can say six in a row . # UI: Just numbers . # UI: That can be in the in the # ID: But uh for a user to remember , if I press that button it goes to that channel . # UI: if you said a favourite # ID: but isn't it hard to remember ? # ID: Like favourite one and # PM: mayb for me it's If I use my telephone , I never use those buttons to call # ID: No , neither do I . # UI: Okay now , m maybe not . # PM: If I don't do it , maybe old people # UI: maybe elderly people . # UI: They don't like new features . # UI: play , pause . I dunno if that's usable # PM: It's not , it's still not It's not anymore n # UI: Not anymore for T_V_ . # UI: I dunno , miss Did I miss any other buttons , basic buttons ? # UI: I couldn't think of any other , 'specially not for T_V_ . # PM: Just on the front as well . # PM: that's the only th the only thing you need . # ID: the p next and previous . # ID: Previous I know , but next channel ? # UI: Just the channel What I mean is # ID: Li like a web browser , # UI: Six seven eight or five . # PM: Just very simple . # ID: But there's also a button to go to the channel you've been before . # ID: Like a web browser back button . # UI: I don't have I did # PM: I know what it is , but I think it's all too difficult for old people . # UI: I don't think you use that . # UI: Y only when you want to go to just use when you wanna switch between channels all the time . # PM: And how do you want to do it , like if you have a channel above ten ? # PM: Normally you can press one , zero or # UI: I think f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons . # UI: So you have that # UI: , the ten plus button . # UI: Just one pressing , or quickly after each other . # UI: To just keep it simple and standard features . # ID: w wouldn't it be a problem to Because you h have to be fast enough . # ID: Maybe the elderly people # ME: It gets some seconds . # UI: But I think that's in the T_V_ as well . That's how the T_V_ handles it . # UI: But you can have a button that says two st two stripes . # ME: it's no it's not a # UI: So you have like a five seconds period to press those two buttons . # ID: but that's th mm # ME: It's what Paul says . # ME: It's not a remote control uh that makes the T_V_ do one two . # ME: It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must type one or two . # UI: So if you have a universal T_V_ controller , you needed one button that has two stripes . # UI: So we have a period of , I dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that And not for elderly people to look , one two press and aim and # PM: But do we still need a two level remote control ? # PM: Because if we only have that l only f # ME: It's only for television now . # UI: So I don't think so . # UI: I just thought of another one . # UI: Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu . # UI: So you also need a menu button . # UI: And then navigation But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next , so you have # ID: I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like m maybe switch channels and volume and k that kind of things , and the menu button . # ID: Because you n almost never use menu button . # PM: Maybe it's still a good idea , I'm not sure . # PM: You'll also have to use a mute button # UI: , a mute button . Yes . # UI: Don't think so . # PM: I don't know where you have to put it . # UI: that's I think that's the layers that produce . # UI: Now I have to figure out what's what to put on . What we're gonna use . # PM: Okay . That's right . # UI: And later we can d do the design . # UI: now my personal preferences . # UI: using the standards , basic I think that we should stand out unique , being unique with the design . # UI: So we have to , I dunno , make a different shape than usual . # UI: So when you are in the shop and you see our T_V_ controller hanging , that it stands out . # UI: Not just in the row when you see all the same remote controls . # PM: Does it have to be it has to be with different colours # UI: I dunno . Different colours # ME: Maybe we can give it out in different colours . # ME: You can choose blue or yellow # PM: It's like a iMac or something . # PM: Just to make it # ME: That's fa That's fancy . That's fashion . # PM: But it looks cheap as well , because it's a small thing . # PM: It's only twenty five Euros . # PM: It looks very cheap if you make it # UI: maybe you can look at mobile phones . # PM: you just I dunno what happened . # PM: , we have to look at mobile phones , that's right . # UI: They they're designed very well . # UI: And well basically are the same , just a bit smaller . # UI: You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it . # UI: But well , I think that's a good example . # PM: we hurry up a bit , because otherwise we won't make it . # PM: Is it fin Are you finished ? # UI: , I I'm finished . # UI: I think we discussed everything . # ID: Okay . Well , the working design . # ID: The method I used is search the web . Just the web page provided . # ID: Basically I'm not very technical uh educated , but I could figure it out . # ID: basically what happens is you press a button , then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , like a switch . # ID: And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows what bu button is pressed . # ID: like you press a one , that circuit is closed Then the chip produces a pattern . Like a Morse code And and sends that to the L_E_D_ . # ID: That's the light emitting diode , I think . # ID: and the light emitting diode is producing infrared light . # ID: That's un invisible to the human eye . # ID: And transmit that to the T_V_ . # ID: However it has also an a visible diode that's blinking red if you look in it . # ID: And that's another diode , I believe . # ID: Because infrared is not visible . # ID: that's er do two different things # PM: we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ? # ID: I I'm not sure if it's the same thing . # PM: it's I think it's usable . # UI: Ain't it just to indicate that it's transmitting ? # ME: that's active . # PM: Or just a green one , because it's If you use it , it's green or the red , it's r green . # ME: I think it's in the case that it's active . # ID: , when you press it . # ME: I it's just the # PM: Red's l shows up like something's wrong , and green is like it's okay , you press the button . # UI: Maybe depends on # ID: Ma on most on most uh remote controls it's red . # PM: Okay , we make it red . # UI: But maybe we don't have to make it red . # UI: Maybe integrate it in the design as well . # PM: You have to The whole the whole remote control becomes green if you press the buttons . # ID: I think the batteries will be a little # UI: maybe it's it is would an e No . Just # PM: we have a recharger in it , If we can still make that then # UI: but it doesn't have to be red . # UI: It's just to indicate something's on . # ID: That it's working . # ID: That it's not the batteries are low . # PM: But it's cool if it was green . # UI: It's it's not very important , # PM: Green or red or whatever , it is cool . # ID: Just to indicate it's working . # ID: And the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern . # ID: So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . # ID: So that it can be used with all the T_V_s . # ID: We have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can o On the Otherwise it won't work . # UI: we have to make buttons for that as well , to make it # ID: The chip is producing the pattern . # ID: So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to # ME: An automatically search function for each television , or something . # ID: That are working . # ID: I dunno how it's exactly how it works . # ID: It wasn't explained there . # UI: I use a universal remote control , and list of all the T_V_s you have , etcetera . # UI: And you have to put in a number , so it works on your T_V_ . # ME: I have a modern one . # ME: And the modern one you type search , and the LED began to blink . # ME: And uh after a short time the television turns off . # ME: And then you know , oh it it's the right one . # ME: And you can stop it , and then it's okay . # ME: So you don't have to search for your television or your code . # ME: It search the pattern for itself . # UI: so we use that . # ID: We have to make a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one . # ID: Because you have to # PM: I just say Can you s just say it again , because I was just looking There's just a short # ID: okay . Well y you have this chip . # ID: That's when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern . # ID: But ma basically for brands of T_V_ these patterns are different . # ID: So like when you press a one on one T_V_ it go to one . # ID: And on the other T_V_ it won't work , basically . # ID: So basically what you have to do is get these patterns right . # ID: And by d that can be done by just cha , changing this pattern all the time . # ME: Changing the signal . # ID: What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , is trying to switch off the television . # ID: And when it's switched off , you can push a button as it's working now , And then he saves that setting and then it's working . # ME: , that's the right option . # ID: Okay . Well the components . # ID: that's a bit technical , and I hadn't I w I was a little short on time . # ID: but I think I understand it . # ID: the energy source is the battery , basically . # ID: that's connecting to all the components . # ID: Because it has to be fed with energy . # ID: the subcomponent is w I think it is the button pressed . # ID: So basically when you press a button , a switch get closed . # ID: that's connecting to a chip . # ID: So the chip knows what button you pressed . # ID: And the chip sends out the pattern to the infrared bulb . # ID: I didn didn't put the description by this one . # ID: Th this is a normal bulb . So the normal flashing light . # PM: So that's the LED , L_E_D_ . # ID: and this is a LED too . # ID: But this one is producing infrared light that's invisible . # ID: And this one is producing normal light . # PM: we can make the normal one also a normal light . Not a LED light , but as a normal one . # PM: To flash up your # ME: if you if you use the buttons , both of them works . # ME: But one you can't see and one indicates that you use a button . # ID: Because when you button press a button and it doesn't work , it can Basically if the battery is low , it won't work . # PM: Maybe you have to put a small light around the button you push . # PM: So you see green if you push that button . # ID: Huh , that's a good idea . # ME: Mm I think it's unnecessary power you use then . # PM: but if you u if you do that , you know that you're sending a signal . # PM: And it's you also know which button you p # ME: But then have to be on the in the all remote control have to be LEDs . # ME: Everywhere in the r # PM: But does it make any difference for the energy you use ? # PM: You got still one LED . # UI: No I don't think so , i it will look different , and I think we need to find something else . # PM: That looks different , . # UI: 'Cause otherwise we will just make another standard , and our motto also is # ME: Is LEDs beneath the buttons ? # UI: , w around the buttons , or in the buttons even . # ID: but mm like when you push it # UI: then won't Then you won't see it . # ID: You have your finger over the button . # ID: So you can see # ME: It must be around it then . # ID: Or or m maybe on top of the A green light is flashing # ME: Not not here , but here . # PM: The same as a telephone , or a mobile phone , or what do you mean ? # UI: , we're thinking about it . # UI: on a mobile phone , in the dark # PM: It lights up . Everything lights up . # PM: That's a good idea . # UI: everything lights up . # UI: Why ain't that on a remote control ? # PM: It it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much . # UI: if a mobile phone a phone can do it , it's # PM: Maybe that's a good idea for old people as well . # UI: i if you're in the dark , you can't see the remote . # PM: It's only few LEDs . Only four or something . Four LED . # UI: But if we use a battery station , which I think we will use # PM: , that's a good idea , okay . # ID: . We'll have enough power # PM: Everything agre Everyone agrees with that , # ME: Maybe what Paul said , under the on the on the home station , a button to call your remote control , that it beeps . # PM: and then you But you have to make a sound device in it then . # ME: , there must be sound in it . # UI: it shouldn't take much # ID: maybe it's that that's a little too hard to make . Especially for that kind of money . # ID: Because it's i it has to be # ME: twenty five Euros , I think we can make it . # ID: Production cost is t twelve and a half . # ME: Twelve and a half , okay . # ME: But but we only have to make it for television , and we must have something special . # UI: I think you also have remote controls with a lot of options . # UI: But we lose about ninety percent of those options . # UI: So I think you can # ME: We have to give our customers some extras . # UI: I think we will save money with that . # PM: Are you almost finished or just # ID: the personal preference , I didn't fill it out . # ID: Because I was short on time . # ID: Basically what we could do too is have a Bluetooth integration . # PM: I just want to talk some about some more . # PM: So maybe you have to Oh , sorry . # PM: Wh what's that ? # PM: We have some new project requirements . # PM: We have to have a look what they are . # PM: They're still in teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet . # PM: So a teletext option , maybe we have to skip that one . # PM: I don't think so , # ID: and I think a lot of people use teletext , still use . # PM: and it's on your comp it's on your television . # PM: It's only one button . # PM: So I don't think it is We definitely should use it . # PM: that's what I told you . # PM: The remote control should only be used for a television . # PM: that's maybe easier . # PM: And the forty plus people , I already told you . # PM: Oh , this is a problem . # PM: Oh sorry about that . # PM: The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . # PM: So it should be flashy or just more interesting . # UI: that's It changes things . # PM: I'm sorry about that . # PM: I just I just didn't read it well . # PM: does it make some decision about that ? # ID: That kinda changes the whole situation . # UI: then we have to make some nice features . # UI: I think the thing in the dark is a good way , # PM: That still stays . # UI: to make it more like a mobile phone . More modern . # UI: That's important I think # ME: L_C_D_ doesn't work for twelve and a half Euros I think . # UI: And I d I don't think it's very usable in a remote control , especially when you only have T_V_ functions on it . # ID: I don't y you'll use it often , because you can see on the television wh what channel you # ME: Oh , I'm watching the channel one . # ME: Okay . No , it's not # UI: , I tho I think that's not usable . # UI: What other features can we put in ? # ID: I think you have to make it a bit flashy and popular . # ID: And then the usability is not that required , because the Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think . # ME: But some of you had something to read about speech recognition . # ME: About you said one and the television turns on one . # ME: Is that reachable maybe ? # ME: That's very That's fancy . That's cool . # UI: It's very fashion . # ID: I didn't read any # ME: Twelve and you've got twelve . # ME: Only the numbers , only numbers . furthermore nothing . But only the numbers , one to twenty or something . # ME: That should be cool . # PM: , maybe we have to integrate that as well . If it's possible . # ME: If it's possible , # PM: I don't think it's very expensive actually . # ME: I didn't read it . # PM: Why should it ? # PM: You only have a microphone in it . # ME: I didn't have information about that . # ID: But it has to work . # ID: And and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or # ME: that's a problem , # ME: only in English . Only in English I think . # UI: But I dunno how that works then . # UI: does your Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever # ID: it's probably my job to figure that out , # UI: one to have in channel one ? # ME: then th we have to think about that . # ME: But do we do it ? # ME: It's more if we if we do it . # UI: is it very usable ? # UI: That's what I'm looking at . # ID: And and do you have to speak in like in a thing # PM: Maybe maybe it's too hard to realise that . # PM: We have short time to put it on the market , # PM: so that We have to do a lot of testing before we can do that . # PM: We make , we can make th the new remote control very flashy . # ME: and In indeed the languages are a difficult thing . # ME: because we have a lot of languages . # UI: I don't think it's useful enough to take the effort to design something with speech recognition . # ID: and also if you have a good speech recognition , you can just throw the # ME: A someone says that give me one Coke , and the T_V_ turns to one . # ID: the remote away . # UI: that's the right command . # UI: And then you have to say T_V_ channel one , or something . Not just one , # ME: but th that becomes your f because that's very hard for speech recognition . # UI: But I don't think , it just ain't useful enough . # PM: we have to make some decisions . # ME: Okay , no speech recognition . # PM: you can see on the we have to know what we're going to put on . # PM: Do we , do we make a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? # PM: If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , so you can see what other but buttons there are , # PM: Okay , we just take that one . # PM: And what else , we have # UI: Also the one in the dark . # UI: It lights up when it's dark ? # PM: but it's Oh th I thought would , that would be the same . # PM: If you push something , it all lights up . # ME: it mustn't work all the time . # UI: Yes , that's what I mean . # ME: It uh it have to work only when you use it . # PM: Or you can switch it on or something . # UI: Or maybe when you # ME: if you use one button , it must turn on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off . # UI: It lights up all . # PM: You have to , that's right . # PM: That's what I said . # PM: It's the same as the telephone . # PM: And do we use a what's it called ? Like a iMac , if you can look through it . # PM: Or just a normal remote control . # UI: Maybe just as an option , w like we discussed , like iPod . # ID: Mm , maybe it's a good idea . # UI: Different colours , maybe use even different fonts . # PM: Different colours . # PM: so y you just make it th through You look through it ? # ME: A see-through . Mm , that's cool . # UI: as an option maybe . # PM: And so the buttons we have , this is , this is normal . # PM: We put in the simple buttons on the top , # UI: It's the standard # PM: and probably the more complicated buttons down there . # ME: But you have You had a lot of different buttons . # UI: we but we don't We don't really have any complicated buttons . # PM: maybe you have you have to when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one . # UI: okay , but , well I think the buttons are very easy . # UI: With just standard buttons we just have so little # PM: but maybe you can put the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . # PM: Because you ne almost never use it . # UI: No , I don't need don't need teletext options are only four buttons or something . # ID: but younger people I think more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext . # UI: I use teletext as well . # ME: I use te teletext every day , I think . # PM: For me too , it is . # PM: we just keep it one level then ? # UI: And I think , 'cause we don't have that many buttons , I think the design is most important . # UI: You can d integrate the buttons in the design very much . # UI: 'Cause simple buttons . # UI: If you put one above it , it's clear . # PM: that's it for toda for We're going to have a lunch break . # UI: How long is lunch break ? # PM: you know what you have to do . # PM: This is this is it . # PM: You get your meal and everything , # ME: Trendwatching . # ME: Okay . That's fine . # PM: we're finished for t for this time . # PM: We're going to have some lunch .
# UI: It won't wake up . # UI: I was a bit early . # UI: I just came in . # UI: normally I was one of them . # UI: Why won't it wake up ? # ME: The power light doesn't work . # ME: You turned it off . # ID: I received an email with a few possibilities on the materials . # ID: So I'll discuss them with you . # PM: we're just going to the later . # UI: I received an email as well . # PM: we're going to talk about the conceptual model . # UI: Which one was mine ? # PM: Okay , so I just show you the m the no mm the minutes , minute . # PM: What's it called , I dunno . # PM: Okay , so we just talked about Oh you want me to show that there # PM: we just talked about it looks . # PM: Has to look nice . # PM: Usability is very important . # PM: People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones . # PM: It has to be very basic , not too many buttons . # PM: Light switches on if you use a button . # PM: text T_V_ still has to be a possibility . # PM: And it has to be easy to learn . # PM: That were the things I make minutes of . # PM: And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute button , and a text T_V_ button . That are the functions . # PM: I just want to give you Mike again , the first presentation of your # ME: Shall I start ? # ME: Okay well I received an email I searched the web , and I searched on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market . # ME: It has been done in Italy and in another country in Europe , I forget it . # ME: but they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . # ME: So it's very important for us to create something new . # ME: what Michael just said , it must be some very different from ordinary remote controls . # ME: Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface . # ME: this aspect is the most important one . # ME: it came out of the research . # ME: It is twice important as the following . # ME: The second most important aspect is that a remote control should it technological innovative . # ME: that stands for uh new technical features . # ME: And then that This is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of L_C_D_ or speech recognition . # ME: But this is the second important aspect , and I think we must use some of the new technology , to be innovative . # PM: But we already have the flashing light # ME: maybe something new . # ME: We have to discuss about it # UI: I'll get back on it . # ME: features not do not exist in current remote controls . # ME: And that's very hard I think . # ME: the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . # ME: But that was an overall point . # ME: We already discussed that . # ME: I've got one picture . # ME: d our target group we thought about was young and trendy . # ME: So I took that part of the webpage . # ME: And it says fashion-watchers of uh Pari France and Italy , have detected the following trends . # ME: This trends I th trend I think it's not that meaningful for us , maybe . # ME: But it's about clothes and shoes . # ME: But the next aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh is expected to be spongy . # ME: But spongy , what does spongy says ? # UI: Spongy , like sponge . # ID: So rubber , kind of . # UI: soft materials . # PM: But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea , because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . # PM: So it has to be flexible . # ME: it's something that it stand there . # ME: But I didn't knew what it means . # ME: So spongy means # ID: It's like a sponge . # ME: it's also a stress-ball . # PM: That's a good That's a good idea . If it's de like that . That's good , a good idea . # ID: somewhat like # PM: Is it a bit like the remote control ? # UI: How are you gonna make it ? # ID: I've some material information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation . # ME: What do I think ? # ME: because a fancy look is the most important thing for remote control , I think about changeable fronts . # ME: maybe a see-through one in a fruit front . # ME: Because it's hot . # ME: And some basic colour fronts . # ME: so we can make five different fronts to start with or something . # ME: maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge . # ME: just another shape than a normal remote control ha has . # ME: Just something round in it , or maybe not I dun dunno . # ME: We have to discuss about that . # ME: Main point still is the technolo technological innovative . # ME: how do we do that ? # ME: Maybe speech ? # ME: We ma must have some kind of gadget . # UI: I'll get back on that . # PM: It's very difficult to do it . # PM: Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control . # ME: that's the problem . That's the main problem . # UI: I got f also an email from the technology department . # ME: Maybe we watch the first the next two presentations . # UI: They have done research about it , and even more possibilities now with speech . # UI: So they recommended using it . # UI: I'll check what they exact mean . # ME: let's first watch Paul's presentation first then . # ID: actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . # ID: But maybe it's cheap and it's easy to implement . # UI: th that's the only problem . # UI: They don't say how much it will cost , if we implement speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well . # ME: It's mass production . # ME: So you can say , you can # UI: Since you have to configure speech thing . # PM: But that's definitely more expensive # UI: that's something I dunno . # ME: But how we we're gonna make many of those . # ME: So we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be . # PM: but a telephone But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and it's about t two hundred Euros . # UI: we gotta de We have to decide on that . # ME: That was this ? # ID: I got an email And it says the chip can be simple , regular or advanced . # ID: They say a display requires an advanced chip . # ID: And this is more expensive than all the other chips . # UI: L_D_C_ doesn't require # ID: it's m the most expensive . # ID: it says in the email . # ID: The display requires an advanced chip . # UI: And speech recognition ? # ID: , probably too . # ID: I haven't got anything about speech recognition , # UI: I'll give you my design . # ID: That's that's the most expensive chip , we need . If we're doing if we're doing a display . # UI: I had to make a sort of a design . # UI: So I did some searching on the internet . # UI: I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como remote controls . # UI: I think we should This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . # UI: I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players . Mobile phones . # PM: just modern but still basic . # UI: More modern . Y yes . # UI: you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller . # UI: 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out both sides . # UI: And here you just have one , few buttons . # UI: So that's the main difference . # UI: But looks I definitely think we should go like this . # UI: And then changeable fonts , It's the most important part , I think . # UI: And the home base is something like that , something simple . # UI: and then I just ordered the buttons a bit . # UI: basic buttons . On-off , mute . And th maybe two others , I dunno . Text buttons . # PM: maybe the teletext tel # UI: , text button , maybe there and there . # UI: And then the colour buttons , if we want it on . # UI: I don't find it very usable , but it's # ME: No , I don't I don't like it . # UI: I don't think it's fits in the modern theme as well . # UI: and then we saw the pla display , in the iPod . # UI: They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . And f above ten . # ID: That's on the display . # UI: That th there is no display there . # UI: But it's on the place of the display . # UI: And I think we should light this up much more than that part . # UI: So the focus is on these two parts . # UI: So you don't see all the buttons you else need . # PM: But it sounds very difficult to use . # PM: Because the volume and channel is on the on the bottom of it . # PM: So you can't use your thumb for it . # UI: This is how it is now . # UI: Here Well we have volume . # ID: I think it is on the bottom too . # PM: But it's not the best . # UI: here we have also side scrolls . # UI: I dunno if we can use that . Do we want to use # PM: for volume . For volume , or a channel . # ID: I've got something of that too . # UI: then we can even simplify it more . # UI: By just putting the volume on the side . # PM: And the channels as well . # UI: And and just channel buttons here . # ID: or maybe The channel buttons are often used . # ID: And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control . # UI: Well . , well it's Basically it's here . # ID: m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we don't use on , in the bottom . # PM: , that's better . # UI: They're on top ? # PM: , just th other buttons like text T_V_ . Put that on the button bottom . # ID: Because you can't hold it . You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons . # UI: You mean these to the low ? # PM: Except from the on-off button . # ID: But I think w you'll use the switch channels buttons more often than the normal channel buttons , like one two three . # ID: So maybe we can put that on the bottom . # UI: Mm Maybe . I dunno , but we'll # ID: Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time . # UI: maybe it's not easy if it's below . # UI: It's harder to zap . # UI: So I think it should be should be easy to . # UI: I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top . # UI: And if you don't light 'em up , they don't you don't see 'em very good . # ID: That's that's good , # UI: I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . # UI: So the focus gets on these parts and not on there . # UI: But the position of course can be different . # UI: We have to look what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use . # UI: So we can switch these to I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half . # ID: I think th the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top . # ID: But we can switch those two , # UI: you have to make sure it's easy to it has to be big enough so you can hold it , that's my findings . # UI: my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player . # UI: And well if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we I don't think we should put it on top then . # UI: I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to switch it open . # UI: if you put in speech recognition , you need so more many more buttons . # UI: Which won't look good on the front side I think . # UI: that's something we have to decide on . # ID: we have to keep it simple . # PM: We have to decide this lecture , or this fifty minutes , how it is gonna look . # UI: What we're gonna do . # ID: the component design . # ID: I looked at some similar devices , and my own common knowledge . # ID: this was on the web site . # ID: If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . So flashy kinda colours . # ID: shapes should be curved , so round shapes . Not Nothing square-like . # UI: iPod is trendy . # UI: And it is well curved square . # ID: , but mm is has round corners I think . # ID: we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing . # UI: Not the old box look . # ID: And sports and gaming device style characteristics . # ID: I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well , popular kind of # PM: we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the remote control . # ID: looking , I think . # PM: the colours also . # PM: So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow . # UI: Black yellow control . # PM: Maybe the sides in yellow and the top in black . # ID: n Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public . # UI: I don't think the colours black and yellow go well together . # PM: We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front . # ID: That's a that's a sen That's just a matter of tastes , We have to use kind of flashy colours , I think . # UI: can't we use different fron fronts , with all with the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So # ID: Like fronts in red and yellow and blue # PM: And still trans Still still transparent . # UI: But with all with logo on it . # ID: this is a remote control , a very old one . # ID: Then the components . # ID: The case has just a Here's black . # PM: we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material . # ID: But anyways it should be transparent . # ID: We decided that , # UI: one of the options . # UI: You can Just like a mobile phone , you can make different fronts on it . # UI: So you can just replace them I think . # UI: That was the idea , # ID: , we could do that . # UI: or just release one . # PM: Just give five with them , just in a box . Five different # UI: Or just sell different ones . # ID: but y you could you could make 'em uh like blue and transparent . # ID: So you can still th look through it . # ID: the buttons . Normal rubber I think . Like normal ordinary buttons . Soft . # PM: It it could be like a Nokia , like plastic . # PM: That's better prob # ID: With the hard buttons . # UI: I think rubber really has an odd look . # ME: The the new modern remote controls , the buttons are part of the style , I think is part of the remote control itself . # ME: It it's one a one out of one shape . # ME: it's n doesn't Is a button How do you say it ? # ID: it's all on one level . # ME: It it didn't it i it don't come out of the on the background . # ME: It is in the c a remote control # ID: I know what you mean . # ID: we have to keep it on the one level . # ID: Like th the top it's # UI: like mobile phones . # UI: Like the iPod . # ID: it's chos So that should be hard plastic . # ID: Then the buttons ? # UI: I dunno what kind of material it is . # ID: I think . Or maybe # PM: But maybe you can m make a round fluff or soft material . # PM: Just only the basic remote control from normal plastic , the rounds of it from softer s # ID: And Then the L_E_D_ . # ID: The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient . # ID: And back light L_E_D_s . # ID: But I think we have to make the case transparent , otherwise the back light won't work . # PM: Y i if you The numbers could be can be # UI: you can just make them around the buttons # UI: Or it runs the whole # ID: but we can still make it transparent . # PM: They can choose . # UI: you can halfs transparent , or just that it's comes out a bit . # ID: And in green colour , the back lights # UI: Different , I think , also . # UI: Whatever you want it , I think . # UI: depends on the colour of the # PM: but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it . # PM: You have to choose # ID: but I think there are multiple colour LEDs . # ID: I know I dunno . Is # ME: but can you change it if you already bought the remote control ? # UI: 'Cause this a mo mib mobile phone as well . # ID: Maybe it's more impor more expensive . # PM: Maybe put some different ones in it . # PM: Doesn't matter . # PM: It's just No , just some LED . # UI: I have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone . # UI: And I can change the colour of it . # PM: Just make it some different colours . Blue , red and green , or something . # ID: Maybe it's too expensive , but it I th I don't think so . # UI: we don't put in any fancier technology yet . So # ID: Then some more technical things . # ID: I don't know what it is , but it should be there I think . # ID: this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in a lot of things . # PM: we have to hurry up a bit , # ID: So we d we just need this and this transistors and resonators . There's all these kind of things . # ID: they basically said that that's almost the same on any remote controls . # UI: I'm sure we can fit in . # ID: So I guess we j we just need that . # ID: I don't know what they do # ME: you can you can change # ID: but they just said we need it . # ID: the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in . # PM: a recharger maybe . # UI: we have to make sure to # PM: We still want to have a recharger , don't we ? # PM: Is that still the # ID: but it i We don't wanna have a ar an How do you call it ? Accu . # PM: A recha Battery . It's just a battery . # UI: Re recharger . Base station . # ID: just batteries , rechargeable batteries . # UI: Yes , rechargeable batteries , I think's best . # ID: Not a separate # PM: just rechargeable batteries . # ID: And a chip , that's this one . # ID: Then I received some possibilities . # ID: for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic Like with the pulse watch . # ID: it operates on your wrist kinda . # PM: But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch . # UI: if you hold it , it gets powered . # ID: If you hold it . # ID: I don't think it will work , Or we can also use solar cells . # ID: But you mostly use it indoors , # PM: It's dark in the room . # PM: It's just batteries , that's cheaper . # ID: and we can use the home station kind of thing . # ID: flat , so uncurved . # ID: two D_ curved is like front to the back . # ID: And three D_ curved is also in depth . # ID: that's possible . # ID: but with three D_ curved remote controls , we must use rubber buttons . # ID: So we can't use the flat buttons . # ID: these kinda materials can be used . # PM: But it doesn't really matter , we just make it plastic . # ID: , I think so too . # PM: The scroll wheels , that's cool . # PM: That's for the volume . # ID: scroll wheels , that's good . # ID: We can use multiple scroll wheels , w if we want to . # ID: But I think just the volume is enough . # UI: For channels it's not handy , because you scroll too fast . # ID: we need the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an L_C_D_ . # PM: I don't think that's an opportunity . # PM: Because we don't have time for that to put it in . # ID: then we use m must use the second most expensive chip . So th so the regular chip . # ID: Because we use scroll wheels . # ID: that was it I guess . # ID: are we using a rubber case , # ID: We haven't decided yet . # PM: Maybe you have to skip that one as well . # UI: I don't think a rubber case looks # ME: but we have to do something about the trend . # ID: i it should be soft . # ME: The trend is spong spongy and fruit or fresh . # UI: That fruit and veg , or # ME: And now we have nothing about those two . # UI: fruit and veg can be just the covers . # ME: i Just on front . # UI: So you can the spongy I dunno . # UI: I can't imagine a soft remote control . # ME: Neith I don't like it neither . # UI: I just can't imagine it . # ID: just hard plastic ? # UI: It's mentioned here . # ID: Titanium , I think it's too expensive . # PM: But maybe the form has to be a bit different . # PM: Not the sh the square form . # PM: Just a bit more rounded . # ID: you can make it curved or mm round . # ID: But just in two D_ , not in depth . # PM: We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these . What exactly . # PM: Because we have to know it . # PM: So the energy is the recharger . # PM: We already know that . # PM: Just a normal battery . # UI: We have batteries . # PM: The chip-on-print is a normal one . # PM: the case is just a plastic one . # ID: th , the chip is the regular one . # PM: , re , regular . , okay . , regular . # ID: You have the simple one , regular and advanced . # ID: So it's b should be regular the second . # ID: I think I'll just check it . # PM: And we need a plastic case , with a scroll wheel . # PM: That's pretty much it . # PM: And a flashy light . # UI: User interface concept . # PM: But we do I don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment . # UI: I dunno either . # ID: Mm . Or should we do it in the next meeting ? # UI: I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board . # PM: That's for the next one . # ID: So we should did it here ? # UI: So we're staying here ? # PM: that I think that's the next meeting . # ID: Or should we do it in the next meeting ? # PM: But you definitely get a specific instruction . # UI: now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ? # PM: But th think about something that's more rounded . # PM: Just And more It has to be # UI: But the iPod and etcetera , M_P_ three players , mobile phones . # PM: a bit . Just just on the top or on the bottom . # UI: Just a bit I'll see if I can see any of those . # PM: Maybe the wheel can be like this . # PM: O if you draw it like this , you get a What the fuck is it ? # PM: Okay . Mm Doesn't work . # PM: You see what I mean ? # PM: If I draw here It draws about four centimetres lower # PM: Maybe you can make it like this . # PM: And this is all the wheel for volume . # PM: So that you just It's all rounded , so you can do turn this one . # ID: Like a very big scroll-wheel . # PM: but just not on the top , but on the side of it . # PM: Maybe , I dunno . # PM: Okay , so we have this at the moment . # ID: I think you'll get a lot of volume changing when it's not wanted . # PM: Okay , so we'd have this . # UI: that's a little problem , of course , as well . # ID: I think it's probably better . # ID: but maybe we can make a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . Only if you use your finger . # UI: maybe you just have to make it That's not scrollable too easy . # PM: And what's the channel choose ? Where do we put that ? # PM: Still on the bottom # ID: I think in middle . # UI: wh what is the middle part ? # PM: That's the numbers . # UI: Numbers , okay . # ID: I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and the switch channel in the middle . # UI: , I agree as well . # PM: It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other . # PM: Because you already have the volume here , You can also put it here one butt and the other one there . Next to each other . back and forth . # PM: So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty . # PM: Because you have to hold it as well . # ID: Or you could do the switch channel up button above the numbers and switch channel down button below . # PM: But that's not want to zap very quick , # UI: I think zapping is the highest priority . # PM: ? Is this a opportunity , # UI: And then you use those # PM: or you don't want a different # ID: but I think we should bu put 'em on top of each other , Because then it's easy to know m if I push the up # PM: But still the next It's still the next one . # ID: but the top the top button is like you switch channel up , and down button is If you put them # PM: but fo from left to right is exactly the same . # PM: It ma it doesn't make a big difference . # UI: I think it's It's it's obvious , I think . # ID: But but I think left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with channel changing . # ME: that's not It's not al always the same . # PM: But it's exactly th # ID: In On most on most remote controls . # ME: Every remote control's different . # ID: So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning time . # PM: You already have the volume on the side , # PM: so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake . # UI: I think it's s so simple # PM: but that's for that's for you , 'cause it's # UI: , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it . # PM: What did What else we have to discuss about ? # UI: Think we need to work thirty minutes again ? # ME: we have to care that it r looks really new . # ME: Because we still hold on to the ordinary uh square remote control . # ME: 'Cause wha what I see the only difference i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside . # UI: you have It is # ID: but i it should be round in shape . # UI: the current controllers are all black and plastic . # UI: You have to look at that image of the iPod . # UI: More that kind of style . # UI: Not not the old grey black # ME: Some some kind of bling mm can we have # UI: Where you can put a ve we have If we do it like that we have below have we a lot of room to put a nice logo . # PM: the logo was has to be on there . # ME: and how many fronts do we put on the market then ? # ME: five or something ? # PM: , five . Let's give five . # UI: Maybe you can buy separate ones # ME: buy the product . You buy , you get one . And basic . # ME: Or you can choose one if you buy the project . # UI: I think That's your choice , I think huh . # ID: tha that will be # PM: y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? # PM: Is that is that a good opportunity ? # PM: you could put it like that , # ME: you sl you let it slide in the docking station . # ID: Do we have to design that w as well ? # ID: The docking station ? # UI: But th , that can be very simple . Least . # ME: we can b It c it could be just a square , just a packet . # ID: just a recharger . # UI: just where you're around something . # UI: we had one example . # ID: But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well . # ME: but that's a round one . # ME: Maybe we can choose then . # UI: Here you see one that's very round . # UI: I think that can be all kind of shapes . # PM: But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit . # ID: Of the remote control ? # PM: Just round it up . # UI: y you don't want this like the iPod . # UI: More rounded . # UI: I think it will just look like more like this one . # UI: Since it's This is also rounded . # PM: just the corners . # UI: I think i tho those are al already a bit cornered . Mm # ID: but we can we can do all kinds of As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes . # UI: but then we have to think of something totally new . # ID: , but , if we want to make it kind of , new . # UI: I've I had a lot of picture of old ones . # UI: And all curves have already been done . # PM: It's a bit annoying , isn't it ? # ME: What do we do wrong ? # ME: Just just more like this and not a square . # ID: but we could do a lot of , lot more curving . # UI: . I know we can do a lot more , # ID: Like in this kind of shape # ME: it's very annoying . # ID: I dunno . I dunno if it's handy . # UI: I think it will only look more like the old remote controls . # ID: The olden the olden ones had looked like just a square thing . # UI: But I had a lot of pictures Oh I can show you here what the old ones look like . # UI: Curves , curves . # UI: You've more there as well . # UI: It wasn't very small one . # UI: That is for elderly . # PM: we have to make a decision , what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have . # UI: I think if w My opinion . If we just take the iPod , and the same look . # UI: So light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours . # UI: And just with together with the back-lights b look will look very new . # UI: No rubber buttons or something . # UI: Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look . More like the M_P_ three player M_ P_ M_ P_ three player . # PM: And you have the scroll button inside . # UI: Yes . Just a simple scrollb # PM: But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ? # PM: Skip that one as well . # UI: Doesn't have to be . # PM: Okay . , it's cool . # ID: though that's a trend . If we want to make it . # ID: I'm not a Trendwatcher , you are . # ME: the t the trend is # PM: Rubber spongy . # ME: spongy and fruity . # ID: Spongeball kinda . # ME: It's not a lot of trends I found # PM: Okay , so we have s still one minute left . # PM: So just I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square . # ID: I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand stuff . # PM: But I think it's still for older people . # PM: You j still have older people . # PM: It's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that , Whatever . # PM: Just you have a normal # ID: but we're aiming at a young public . # ME: There is one There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original , and I hope we can make it look not like the iPod itself . # ME: It must have uh a very different # UI: But you're If you look at the way remote controls are now # PM: But i it is it is it is already fancy . Because of the lights on the bottom of it . That's already fancy . # UI: And if you make it look like the iPod # ME: , they're all the same . # UI: that's already a very big change # PM: maybe make the mm the wha what's it called scroll wheel . Make it in yellow or something . Just like the colours of Real Reaction . # UI: compared to Ye . Well # ID: , we could do that . # ME: but if you the f front , the scroll wheel will still be yellow . # UI: Think the scroll wheel won't be very big . # UI: Since if you put it somewhere , the chances that it will scroll are too big . # UI: So it will just be a small scroll wheel . # UI: So it won't stick out much . # PM: Maybe the ones we are going to draw there . # PM: Maybe we have to ask to the mm to her if it has if it can work better than this . # PM: Because it doesn't work properly . # PM: So maybe you have to ask her . # UI: okay . Well , maybe we can just open images there , and I'll paint and paint . # PM: That's probably # UI: I'll be able to do a better job . # ME: If you set the pen , he will draw here . # PM: Okay , so just finish it . # PM: So we make it a bit like m that one probably . # UI: , I agree more like iPod . # PM: only the colour and the flashy light and the We just we just skip the voca or was it the speech recognition . # UI: do we s keep that ? # PM: But you'd definitely need a advanced chip . # ID: And we have to build in a microphone # UI: that's very easy . # UI: We already have the beeping of the home station , # ID: and I do I don't know anything about that . # ID: I d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition , # UI: strange that I received the information about that . # ME: the ma the main points I just said . We have to be original and technological innovative . # PM: Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well , # UI: shall we it open then ? # UI: So we can put all the # PM: The function of that in there . # PM: And we need a Probably we need a advanced chip then . # ID: , we probably do . # PM: But it doesn't say anything about it , does it ? # ME: But we don't have any f information about the cost . # ME: We started with information about the cost was now th # UI: I just I just received the # ID: , I have I have some information about the cost . But just a about the chip . # ME: And how much is the chip ? # ID: I don't know how much , # UI: our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit . # ID: Just in inexpensive or # UI: This is a very small electronic unit , will give a standard answer after it recognise a question . # ME: And how does it work ? # UI: Just You say record , followed by your question sample , and after a few seconds the answer sample . # UI: Because it works like good morning remote control , and then the remote control says good morning . # PM: It doesn't has to say anything . # PM: Just You have to just talk to # UI: th that's just It's a # ME: Does it say does it say something back ? # PM: we have to stop it now . # UI: that's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that's in it . # PM: that's a r That's that's a advanced # ID: But i it's a separate chip . # UI: I dunno , but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well . # ID: I don't know anything about this , # PM: we just decide not to put it in , # PM: because it's too difficult . # UI: it would be would be a good feature . # PM: Okay , we just put it in , because it's a good feature . # PM: We have to stop now . # UI: No no worries about the cost , etcetera . # UI: And there's a chip in it that will # PM: We have to stop it now .
# UI: It's not saved yet . # UI: Our beautiful drawing . # PM: So just f So this is our agenda . # PM: F You're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me . # PM: I didn't So these are the # PM: So these are the last notes we I made . # PM: If anything doesn't look right , just say it to me then . # PM: I don't have to put it in the report . # UI: Are we doing the speech recognition ? # UI: Because we didn't have enough time to de design the inside as well . # PM: Okay , but it's still possible uh financially . # PM: So if you want to , it's okay . # UI: Okay . Well then we're gonna put it in . # UI: , just we have to design the inside then , but it should be # ID: Or are we making a slide open , like underneath ? # PM: Slide open is quite usable for remote controls . # ID: It's probably better . # ID: , s Like underneath you can slide it open and you other functions . # UI: It's may maybe a bit stronger as well . # PM: Maybe that's better . # PM: , that's a very good point . # UI: Okay , so when you have a lot of room inside . # ID: Think that's better . # UI: So you can make it very easy to use . 'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it . # PM: So this is okay ? # UI: , we're gonna use the advanced chip then . # PM: so that's I'll just have a look how much that is . # UI: Advanced chip was for spee . # ID: , I think so . I don't know . # PM: No , you have a different chip for speech recognition . So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget . # PM: So you can show your prototype if you want to . # ID: , it's Let's do it together . # UI: I'll give comments . # ID: , we just made a Word file with the basic elements . # ID: the look-and-feel model . # ID: well the form , the case as drawn there . # ID: Simply a square with round corners . # ID: So that's basically it . # ID: the material should be hard plastic . # ID: colour changeable , and also transparent . # ID: And colour and transparent , or just transparent , I don't know . # ID: then the elements . # ID: we have The functions are just basic . # ID: Like I've pointed them here . # ID: Mute function , on-off function , text functions . # ID: This switch channel . # ID: And this is the num-pad . # ID: And the logo is over here , and the mic . # ID: And the scrollwheel , no ? # ID: You operate that with your pointing finger . # ID: So you hold it like this in your right hand and # PM: So how many functions do you need for the microphone ? # UI: Speech recognition . # PM: , speech recognition . # PM: Only one button to say it's on or off . # UI: I didn't have a specification of that . But I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something . # ID: , maybe you have to configure it . # UI: Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore . # PM: So you can put it on the back as well if you want to . # UI: , you can put 'em all on the back . That's for sure . # ID: , or on the slide function , I don't know . # ID: Well we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad . # UI: We also don't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons . # UI: You have a lot of room if you can slide it open . # PM: , you can put it separate . # UI: I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . So But it's enough room . # ID: the position ? # ID: , you write You wrote this , so . # UI: Well the main , the main zap buttons are most central . # UI: That was the most important thing . # UI: So the best place , the best reach place on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find . # UI: the on-off button is a bit bigger , so it stands out . # UI: That way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's will show up . # UI: scrollwheel is on the left side . # UI: It's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know . # ID: But it's not impossible to use it , if you're left handed . So y Because you can use your thumb then . # ME: Just just one thing now . # ME: y you need to have more one two th You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine . # ME: But you missed the no the zero and the two stripes . # UI: That's that's below that then . # UI: It's twelve buttons . # ID: just so you get that . # ME: Okay , but It's rather important . # UI: okay , just we just missed that . # UI: But I'll just I'll get back to later . # UI: F the form well , we've taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device . # UI: So should be popular . # UI: The f the buttons creating ? # UI: That or all round shapes , not rounded corners . # UI: So that , you know , you get a bit round feeling . # UI: we'll use hard plastic . Since that allows us to use two D_ buttons , non-rubber buttons . # UI: Colour changeable . # UI: Well and the backlight thing , the thing that lights up . # UI: We have decided in the channel buttons , there's a little colour around it . # UI: And also in the num-pads , there's also colour light behind it . # PM: And do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ? # UI: So when you pre # PM: How do you want to implement that ? # PM: Just on the Maybe on the second level as well ? # UI: We're going to implement . # UI: Mm just a little # ID: , these are just basic functions , so All the non-basic are in # PM: Okay , just draw the second level , because we need that as well . # ME: Okay , there is one function I use daily , and it's not on the basic functions . # ME: It's to switch to uh your Scart . # ME: Play Station or D_V_D_ player . # ID: Okay , maybe we use this button for the # ME: That function must be Or you can i lay it beneath in the other functions . # UI: To your video device . # PM: Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something . # ID: A second level ? # ID: Like a new blank one or Or just here ? # PM: No no , just on Down there . # ME: And h how does the second level come out ? # ME: it slides along ? # UI: slides I think . # ME: From from the beneath ? # PM: For the bottom . # UI: You can do it that it claps open , but I think that's not solid enough . # PM: No , you gotta slide it . # UI: If that breaks then you're screwed . # UI: So it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open . # ID: So what do we need ? # UI: i the speech functions buttons . # UI: With maybe arrows . # UI: So you can scroll in the , navigate the menu . # UI: I think we can even put a We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit channels . # ME: And so y you keep you keep one , you have one left . Yes . # UI: So you have one left for the Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera . That's used pretty often . # ID: So this is the # UI: If you have a Play Station , mm you use it every day . # ID: Extern or something . # PM: You want to save that file as well ? The drawing ? # ID: So here are multiple speech buttons , I don't know how many . # PM: Doesn't really matter . # UI: It doesn't really matter . # ID: I don't know the functions . # UI: well we don't have any # UI: menu buttons with arrows . # UI: I think it's best if we do . # UI: Mm where do we have Or there . # ID: Like a normal # UI: Like on the normal Like this . # ID: , with in the middle a menu button . # UI: The menu button , yes . # UI: Well we don't have any , anything on how many buttons speech requires . So you can't redesign it . # ME: Maybe one button to switch the colour of your LEDs ? # ME: and you can hold it , you can hold it , and then the colours switch or mm multiple buttons . # UI: Just press it once , the colour should switch . Press again , the colour switch again maybe ? # PM: Or we just make it three buttons , all the colours on it . # PM: Just red , yel red , green and # ME: If we have enough place , then we can do that . # PM: That's that's very easy , . # ID: We can put those here . # ME: Colour buttons . # ME: And then we choose green , blue and red or # ID: So did we miss anything ? # UI: , maybe some text next to the scroll wheel , that it is volume . # ME: Some text buttons . # PM: No , ma on o on the on the # UI: I just The volume logo . # ME: there's one there's one text button I # ME: There's one text button I prefer . # ME: That's the one that you use if you search for a page , like seven hundred , and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text . # UI: , we have that on the text button . # ME: Do you do you Did you think of that ? # ID: , but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext . You just switch it off and then # PM: , just put it on those extra f extra function as well . # ID: Well w we thought of a text button . # ID: And if you press it again , you get the # ME: The sta the state you # PM: Oh just three stages , # ID: through view . # UI: , the three stages . Yes . # ID: , b but if you're in the second stage , the third stage is switch teletext off . # ID: So you can switch back from second to w first . # UI: No , it doesn't have to turn it off . # ME: No . Just remember where it was . # ME: It it doesn't uh clear the page . # ME: If you if you turn teletext on , you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ? # PM: Yes , that's to remember . # ME: But maybe it's not the way # PM: That's a functionality for the television . # UI: , I think as well , but . # ME: Mm . That's maybe one thing we can discuss about . # ID: the remote can send like the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . Th th if you switch it on . # UI: in thi the remote control in the # PM: , but you have to search every time again . # PM: That's what happening if you do it like that . # PM: But it's still the television that has to do that . # UI: do we need to fix that or # PM: No , that's what the television does . # ME: Mm most new T_V_s do collect all the pages . # ID: , those memory functions . # ME: But not every television , so # PM: Okay , it's cool . # ID: Was this logo for volume ? # PM: Is this prich pretty much it , ? # ME: , I thought about one thing . # ME: the buttons ? from which material are they now ? # UI: Just like your telephone , hard plastic . # ID: . Just hard plastic . So # PM: It's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway . # ME: Because if you use it a couple of years , some sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away , And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ? # ME: Or shall we just turn it on the buttons ? # UI: I think just on the buttons . # UI: If you do it abo above or below , it takes more space . # ME: Well . That's too much place . # UI: I don't think the space is worth it . # ME: Okay , just leave it . Just leave it . # ID: I think you have that problem more often with rubber buttons . # ME: The most time , with rubber buttons . , okay . # PM: , I don't know what this means . # PM: But I think we just evela evaluated this one . # ME: , I made some criteria , so we can ev evaluate our model . # PM: Oh okay , you made some criteria . Okay , cool . # ME: I d I don't think if it's right . # ME: That shall show it . # PM: You have some usability criteria or # ME: no , all criterias we just argue about . # ID: In the bottom . # PM: Look-and-feel ? # ID: No , evaluation is # ME: Evaluation crit , evaluation presentation . # ME: d it doesn't matter It only had two pages or something . # ME: well I looked in the reports from the marketing strategy , or of the new needs and the market . # ME: The Italians , how they think about it . # ME: The research about the comp the users and that kind of stuff . # ME: I made some criteria , and we have to test the criteria from one to zero . # ME: We sh we can give it a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our And this These are all I found , or I wrote down . # ME: And we have to discuss about , if we give it a one or a seven . # PM: I think if you have a kind of iPod idea . It quite beautiful . # PM: We are actu We are the # ME: , the difference be between beautiful and fancy look-and-feel is the outside beautiful like the iPod or something . # ME: And fancy's more like the mm f the flashing lights and the colours and that kind of stuff . # UI: Well I think we do # UI: If it's really , if you can if you can get the iPod look , then it's beautiful , I think . # ME: And and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours were you thought of ? # ID: beautiful's is also a matter of taste . # ME: The basic colours are black or green or yellow ? # UI: basic colours , # ME: Or you haven't thought about # UI: Well you didn't say . # ME: Ho how do we make # UI: Maybe company colours ? # ME: Black and yellow . # PM: , yellow light . # UI: A bit a bit of yellow . # PM: Do we have yellow light ? # PM: No , not really , but it's possible . # UI: Not not yellow , but just a bit of light yellow . # ME: Black white , maybe ? # UI: Like white , also ni or always nice . # ID: And what colours should the buttons be ? # PM: , different colours . # PM: This is Oh , the same as th the cover . # PM: But also th the light behind it . # ID: But can you change those too , with the switch ? # PM: Make them No , just make them black or grey or something . # UI: , grey . Just dark grey I think . # ME: Okay , so what number do we give a beautiful ? # ME: Beautiful is really subjective , because it has to do lots with the colours . # UI: Well we have changeable fronts , so # ME: Changeable fronts , so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful . # PM: just give it a one . It's okay . # PM: I think it's just what you want . # UI: It's hard to decide for us , but . # ID: It's ju so subjective . # UI: At least it's a lot better than current remote controls . # PM: Okay , just give it a two . # ME: The fancy look-and-feel . # ME: That's about our flashing lights and the background lights from the buttons . # ME: And we can change the colours , so that's really fancy I think . # ID: One more thing . # ID: Are w are we changing Or are they there backlights on the slide panel too ? # ID: Or n no back light ? # PM: No . No , it's only on the number , behind the numbers # UI: Mm . Not needed . # UI: , not needed I think . # ID: And and the switch channel is There is a back light too ? # ME: Oh , you mean th this here ? # PM: , but that's unnecessary . # UI: What do I think is necessary item ? # ME: It's pretty cool . If you slide it open , it lights up . # ME: That's that's really fancy , but I don't know if it's reachable . # UI: Of course it's reachable . # PM: It doesn't make # UI: Okay , maybe just some light to light it all up . # UI: So you can see what's really there . # UI: Not just not re on the buttons or something . # UI: Just a green light or some blue light . # UI: To light it all up . # PM: But . Mayb Okay . # ID: , just backlight . # ID: Not not the buttons . # ID: And th and the normal backlights also not the buttons , but behind the buttons . # ID: So the buttons are just grey . # UI: Well . semi-transparent . # PM: , just only , that's right . # ME: Okay , fine . So I think it's very fancy . # PM: , that's how I think . # UI: , w we've done a lot of detail in light , so # ME: So I'll give it a , and you can also choose your light , so # PM: , this It is a one . # PM: It's okay . It's cool . # ME: I think it's one . # PM: This is a difficult one , because we don't , we don't know it about the # ME: Learnable ? Easy to use ? # ME: , we shall test it # PM: it's very easy to use , but the second layer is not easy to use . # ID: No , but you don't have to use that . # ID: And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer . # ID: That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it . # UI: So I think it's easy to use , And learnable is a bit # ME: It's not as fast as a usual uh remote control . # ID: Well , I think it is . # ME: Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel . # ME: I think you must seek for it , and up or down or # PM: But the rest of it is very easy , # PM: because there are so n # UI: , I think it's very clear what it all does . # ID: So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function . # UI: But the second parts , like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn . # PM: So it is learnable f i In the first place it's very easy to use . # PM: And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used a different kind of device . # ME: . But we we've got the two so two or three new things , huh ? # ME: And maybe we maybe learnable is in compare of old fashion remote controls . # ME: So we h we have speech , the scroll wheel , and the slide . You must slide it . # ME: And that's not normal at the normal remote controls . # ME: 'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than easy to use . # ME: Because easy to use comes after learnable . # PM: Okay , just Easy to use is very cool , # ME: I think it a three or something . # PM: so just give it a two . # UI: Maybe three then . # PM: No , but definitely better , much better than avera average , . # ID: And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know # ME: New features . Techno technological innovative ? # ID: The speech function and the colour . Colour . # ME: The speech function is new . # UI: And the scrollwheel , backlights , slide . # ME: The scrollwheel and the slide . I think the slide is pretty new . # PM: Slide is not n is not new . No . # PM: I already have a # ME: I only saw it in a telephone , not in an remote control . # PM: I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight . And they all have a slide in it . # PM: So that's not new . # UI: But also slide that buttons come out , as well ? # ME: Okay , and the lightning ? # ME: The lighting's new . # ID: Mm it's pretty new , I think . # ME: Scrollwheel . # ID: Speech is new . # UI: Different colours , so # ME: , different fronts for a remote control , I think that's new too . # ME: So we have a pretty new # PM: There are no games on it , that's It's not a one , it's a two again . # UI: That would And we didn't # ME: It's it's not L_C_D_ or something . # UI: But then we also have the home station . # UI: We are forgetting about that now , but # PM: Oh , that's right . Rechargeable . # ME: Home-station . # ID: , we didn't draw that too , but # UI: But that's more like now . # PM: , just draw it afterwards . # ID: , that's just a normal th s simple thing . # PM: Can you save it on the same , in the same map as the other ones ? In the project map ? # UI: Just save , save as ? # PM: No , that's not in the project . # ID: Well it's a already in the folder . L like number seven . # PM: This one is not yet in the # ID: No , I think it is . # UI: , it doesn't matter . # PM: But you still have to draw the resi the recharger . # ME: all the seven , all the seven . # PM: Okay . And new features , so we give it a two or also again a one ? # PM: No , I think i if you have games on it , then you give you have a one . # ME: No , we are not extraordinary new or something . # PM: No , just so it's still a two . # ID: Mm two , I think . # PM: Targeted audience . # PM: we are the targeted audience ? # ME: we searched for a young group , audience , beneath f forty . # PM: , but l younger than forty . # PM: So we are exactly the targeted group . # ME: , but did we reach , with our style , the targeted audience ? # ME: Th that's my question . # PM: You get the fancy things for younger people . And you get the aesthetic things for older people . # ID: We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel , and that's what attracts the young audience . So think that's a two or a one . # ME: the only point is that we don't have uh That's that's That's this question . # ID: , but s it That's basically not handy . # ID: And I don't thi I don't see # ME: So we targeted it ? # ME: But we didn't follow the latest trends . # ID: , you could make a front # UI: Mm . I think we followed the latest trends . # ID: a front that's like a banana , or something . # ME: Tha these are the only latest trends I get on my computer . # UI: Oh right . Well fruit and vegetables , . # PM: , you get different colours . # UI: You can different front # ME: , th So we had we have a fruit # ID: Like a f banana kind of front . # ME: But spongy will never be . # ME: So we give ourself a three or something . # PM: So that's eleven . # ME: What's the average ? # ID: Eleven divided by six . # PM: , it is one point eight three . # ME: A perfect score . # ME: No , I don't know . # ID: We're not too hard on ourselves . # UI: This is a power indicator . So you can see how far it's charged up . # ME: And and you need n a button to call it , to let it beep . # PM: Oh , that's still # ID: , but we have to make a speaker then too . If you want to make it beep . # PM: , maybe we have to skip that one . # UI: No no , I want that in . # ID: But we can we can do it underneath the logo . # ME: No , we need that . That's usable . That's really usable . # UI: th the speaker is very small as well , # PM: So I just got a financial You s saved it or # PM: Okay , let's have a look at this one here , the production cost of it . # PM: If I forgot anything , just say it to me . # PM: It just is a battery . # PM: , there are some that they didn't mention , because recharge is not on the list . # PM: So I think we are pretty much in the right direction , because it's twelve point three Euros . # PM: So this is a regular chip incl and a sample speaker . # PM: So that's both . # ME: Come on , it's perfect . twelve point three point three . # PM: , and single curved . # ID: But but is it inc Does it include a homestation or # PM: No , that's not on the list . # PM: But that shouldn't be . # ID: Can we make that for h twenty cents ? # PM: The b the button supplements , I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was I'm not sure . # UI: different fronts , but standard front won't be , . # PM: See it's I think it's okay like this . # ME: Special form , . # PM: It's hard to say . # PM: But maybe we have to Special colour , you can skip this one , because it's all quite normal . # PM: We get different ones , that's all . # PM: So you can put a recharger in it as well . # PM: But this is expensive , the sample speaker . # ME: Four . It's four Euros . # UI: Is that included ? In the twelve Euro or # PM: , that's included . # UI: Okay , then we then we need to use it . # ID: It's kind of weird that we get this information now , afterwards . # PM: Okay , so this is pretty much it this . # UI: Damn , solar cells are expensive . # PM: So I just want you , we just made it . # PM: So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for everything together . # PM: We can do some discussion about this . # PM: Was there room for creativity ? # PM: Paul , was there room for crea creativity ? # UI: Mm i , I think so . # UI: I think everyone already . So # ID: m If we got a high mark for innovativeness or innovativity # ME: Or a different style . # ID: then there we probably have been creative . # UI: I think we discussed a lot of things about it . So # ME: We could make a lot of different remote controls . # ME: So it's creativity . # PM: Okay , so the leadership Was there a leadership and # UI: Of course there was . # PM: What do you have to say about that ? # ME: Who was the leader ? # ID: Just normal discussion , I think . Not one leader or something . # UI: One leader to check the time , etcetera . # ID: And make notes . # UI: So more like a secretary . # PM: Okay , next one . # PM: team work the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard . # PM: We were not all We were not agree with every not agree with . # ME: We were not finished . # ID: , w we had so much information , that we get through email and just # PM: We're not finished . # UI: I think we got wrong information at the wrong time . # UI: I think that was the m biggest problem . # UI: Like the prices . # UI: If we knew that before , we could have had discussion really s really quicker . # ID: , th that's weird . # ME: , because the prices could be twenty Euros or something now . # UI: , and if you had fifteen Euros , then we would it . # ID: So we're bacal basically just lucky to get the price right . # PM: But the teamwork was okay . # ME: , everybody could speak their opinion . # UI: I think everyone listen to each other . # UI: Like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design . # PM: , what I have to say about means . # PM: The smart board is okay . # PM: Digital pen is horrible . # PM: I dunno if you use it . # PM: But if you want to download it to your computer , it's doesn't work . # UI: Just doesn't work . # UI: Well smart board would be very nice to work with , if it worked really well . # ME: Digital pen or # UI: Just not work too slow . # ID: , i if it would be faster , it would be great . # ME: , the drawings are hard to make , I think . # UI: , more accurate . # UI: , it's i It should be more accurate . # UI: And I think it would be great if you could edit it from , just with a mouse , from where you're sitting . # UI: Not just pointing out on it . # PM: It's the same for the presenta for the presentations . # PM: You can do it from here . That's much easier than standing there . # ID: , and p just point with a mouse . # UI: No use to draw on the board itself . It's just slows down . # ID: Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style . # ID: But you might as well do it in normal computer style . # UI: , even harder to draw like this than black board style . # ID: And it's far too slow this way . # UI: You cou You could draw on it , but not as main function . # PM: So we made it in time . # PM: And we made a remote control . # PM: In the budget , . # UI: New ideas found . # PM: I don't know what it mean . # UI: I just think if we # ME: To gather , or to work together , or new ideas for # PM: For remote control probably . # PM: No , for the project . # UI: For remote control , a favourite for your text . # ME: No , for the prototype . New ideas . # ID: , but still , you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a prototype out of this . Because we don't have any sizes and # PM: But it's for the next team . # PM: We don't have to do that . # ID: , but it You can't possibly do that in such a short time , I think . # UI: this is just the idea phase , # ID: , just brainstorming basically . # ID: So are we finished ? # PM: I think just I just write a final report . # PM: we have only four minutes left . # UI: Oh , what do we have to do now . # UI: I thought we were done at four o'clock ? # ID: It's now quarter past three . So # ME: I should take some pictures . # UI: Mm we can do it afterwards , so # ME: Let's play minesweeper . # UI: I found it as well . # UI: One two three four five six seven cameras . # UI: So that was it . # ID: Now we can look at this . # ID: We're probably not supposed to look at this , but # UI: The old versions . # ID: , from the previous group . # UI: They went for a universal device . # ID: The touchscreen , . # UI: , but also a different device . # UI: Then an L_C_D_ would be handy . # ID: Here are the basic functions in here , the selecting dev devices . # UI: , and touch screens for all our stuff , . # UI: I do agree with that . # UI: English is not so hard by the way . # ME: I'm breaking a world record here . # UI: Project Manager ? # ME: We've got a problem , Paul . # UI: , you have to make a choice . # ME: No it's your choice . # UI: Wow , that's pretty quick . # ME: Just pick one . # UI: You have to decide . # UI: It's the lower one . # ME: What's this ? A bomb or not a bo # UI: No no , the upper one is the bomb . # ME: This the bomb ? # UI: No . That's too much work . # ME: Is that previous work ? # UI: I challenge you . # ME: Oh , that's so stupid . # ME: No , that doesn't work . # UI: No , you gotta use the magic pen . # UI: What if I put one there ? # ME: That's stupid . # UI: , you had two choices . # UI: That's gonna be draw . # UI: I'll put it here . # UI: You are going to put it there . # ME: , then I put it there . # UI: It's a difficult choice , either here or there . # ID: This is a very interesting design . # ME: It's just the same as normal . # ID: Well it has a L_C_D_ , I think . # UI: Then do it correctly . # ME: Stupid design . Stupid . # ID: And what else do we have ? # UI: Stupid , the L_C_D_ screen . # ME: 'Kay wait , I'm going to draw something and you must y # UI: Okay , I'm going to guess what you're drawing . # UI: No no , the new one . # UI: they just don't save it . # UI: , you have to use the pen s stupid . # PM: You have to save everything , you know that , huh ? # UI: No , not everything . # UI: Pen , select pen . # ID: It wants to know what we do in our spare time . # ME: No , it's Only you can know it . # UI: Oh , I can know it . # ME: It's very hard to draw . # UI: Okay , that makes it easier . # UI: I think I know . # UI: I think I know what you're trying to draw , but it's wrong already . # UI: , you missed the right side . # UI: No , you're wrong , you're wrong # ME: A little bit maybe , but # UI: See where you're wrong now ? # UI: The entrance . # ID: Warning . Finish meeting now . # ME: Okay , the entrance is more to the left . # ID: Warning . Warning . # UI: You're correct . # ME: But but I think this part # UI: , but I think Oh no you made another mistake . # ME: Oh . , there are a lot of mistakes , because the walls are thick like this . # UI: No I w Okay , I'm not that whiny . # UI: But there was a big hole here as well , and there as well . # ME: Oh , that's true . # ME: here . , they're walking behind the walls . # UI: That's a kinda big mistake . # UI: Warning , finish meeting now . # UI: Guys , I think we have to finish the meeting . # ME: 'Kay this is a hard one . # ID: Boom-boa-ring-bing . # UI: What does it say ? # ID: Fill in the questionnaire . # ID: No more chit-chat . # UI: Oh you gotta finish # ME: Che-che-che-che . # UI: In your own room ? # UI: I'm gonna be so lonely . # UI: Mm I'll clean that up later . # ME: This is That's my new interface . # ME: That's a edited smiley .
# ME: We're the first . # UI: Mm . We're the first ones . # ME: Marketing Expert , yes . # PM: So you found your spots . # UI: Move to the meeting room . # ME: where has my screen gone ? # UI: Hello , good day . # ID: we have to talk in English , # ME: My screen is gone . # PM: It's called black . # UI: Kick-off meeting , wow . # UI: It's looks nice . # ID: I'm afraid I'm a bit slow for this stuff . # ID: I'm afraid I'm a bit too slow . # ID: I don't know how much preparation you guys did , but not a lot . # UI: No , it's it was not enough . # PM: You see this beautiful presentation . # PM: let's get started . # PM: I sort of prepared this . # PM: opening acquaintance , tool training , how to use the things here . project plan discussion , and then the rest of the meeting . # PM: we're supposed to develop a new remote control , that's both original , trendy and user-friendly . # PM: hope you have good ideas . # PM: we're work we're working from top to bottom . functional design , # PM: then we do some in individual work , then we have a meeting to discuss the results , etcetera . # PM: And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up . # PM: we have available the smart board and the whiteboard . # PM: we should take some practice . # PM: I have some instructions now to do that . # PM: you know how to the documents work . # PM: this for toolbar . You see it next . # PM: And we can use this pen to perform . # PM: It doesn't always work . # PM: Okay so you can draw . # ME: Draw . Alright . # PM: and in the format menu you can select colour and line width , etcetera . # PM: Each of you can take some practice and you should draw an animal . you should explain with different colours and with different pen widths . # PM: And you should explain why you draw that particular animal . # ME: Don't take up too much space . # ID: Different pen widths , how do you do that ? # PM: with the format menu . # PM: And use different colours etcetera . # UI: It's a giraffe . # PM: And what's that supposed to be ? # ID: Are you serious ? # ME: Should it be one # ME: Giraffe's yellow . # UI: it needs some yellow Oh format . # ME: Can you use one blank sheet per drawing ? Or so y you must save it at the end and then # PM: you can press the next button , which is I'll show you . # UI: That's some spots . # ID: I in the file option menu . # ME: then m make a new one . # ID: How much time do we have to draw anyway ? # ID: 'Cause I can take forever on this . # UI: Do I have to explain why I chose this animal ? # UI: I think it's a it's a great animal . # UI: It's a it's a giraffe . # PM: A giraffe okay . # PM: I see a long neck # ME: It's more like a dinosaur . # UI: I'll will give it an eye . # PM: That's nice of you . # ME: Some leaf to eat . # PM: Okay . pretty good . # PM: could you press the next # ID: Is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other ? # PM: introduction and get acquainted # PM: That's the idea , # ID: Your line broke . # PM: it's a bit slow , # ME: It's not that fast . # ME: It misses the spot . # ID: I'm guessing a turtle . # ME: I say good guess . # ID: Because of its shell . # ME: Because it's slow . # PM: You were slow too # UI: 'cause it's green . # ME: I was a bit slow too . # ID: Dude you're a good drawer . # ME: some other line width # ID: Do you have a turtle pet ? # ME: Does it have legs ? # PM: not exactly legs but More like fins # ID: Stumpy stuff . # ME: It's more like a tank . # ID: They kind of l look like mole legs . With sharp nails on . # ME: but I don't know where . # PM: it's l looks very friendly . # ME: that's a fr friendly turtle I guess . # ME: I think it's fair enough . # ID: A little tail maybe . # ME: I don't know what the position is . # ME: Does it have ears ? # ID: The little holes maybe . # ME: Can you erase ears # ID: And why did you choose this animal ? # PM: He said it was slow . # ME: I it just came into my mind . # ME: So there's no particular reason # ME: I'm guess I'm done . # ME: That's my turtle . # PM: Your turn Niels . # ME: How to select the next or # ID: Colours were under format # PM: Makes new paper . # ID: How am I gonna do this ? # UI: A rabbit I think . # ID: Not quite actually . # ID: Not quite yet through . # ME: A cat who had an accident or # ID: They're my favourite pets . # PM: You have some ? # ID: I have colour already . # ID: I'm not so good at drawing with this kind of # ID: Excuse my language . # ID: I don't know how to draw its face . # ID: But you get the idea . # ID: It's my favourite pet animal , 'cause they're cute , they're independent and cuddly , I dunno . # ID: Or do I need to use more colours # PM: I think it's okay . # PM: we have a financial aspect to this project . # PM: we can sell them at twenty five Euros . # PM: the aim is to reach uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros . # PM: that's quite a big amount of money . # PM: And the production cost should be the half of the selling price . # ID: So we have to s # PM: now it's time for some discussion . # UI: What what do you want to discuss ? # PM: We should get started . # PM: I'm taking notes . # PM: we each have a specific task , as I saw in my mail . # PM: I didn't know if you received the same mail . # PM: Okay so the this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design . # PM: the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions . # PM: And the Marketing Expert should come up with user requirements . # PM: did any of you already do some work on this part # ID: I started making an overview for myself , what I had to do , 'cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever . # ID: So I had to , I dunno , make an overview for myself about what I have to do , and kind of let it work in to get ideas about well how I have to fill it . # PM: And do you have any ideas about the product so far ? # ID: I started I started with the first phase , I think was the functional . # ID: And let's see I had to focus on the working design , which you said . # ID: How does the apparatus work ? # ID: And well I basically had two points . # ID: according to the coffee machine example , I have batteries to supply energy , and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ . # ID: And that's basically all I have so far . # PM: I got another point . # PM: It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo . # UI: Wireless huh . # ME: that's very common . # UI: it's some buttons for the on off function . # UI: You d you already told that . # UI: And for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume . # UI: That are the basic options for a remote control . # ID: I kept it global that it activates or deactivates specific functions , 'cause I wasn't thinking yet about that . # ID: I mean , you wanna ch flip the channel but you might wanna use teletext also . # ID: I dunno what the word is in English . # PM: Same I believe . # PM: and what did the Marketing Expert do ? # ME: from a marketing perspective , well the function des design phase consists out of the user requirements . # ME: what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? # ME: there are a few means to reach that by doing research to see what existing products are there out in the market . # ME: I mean , what functions do they have . # ME: especially what are their shortcomings ? # ME: Are there any new functions which can be added to our product ? # ME: therefore we have to do some internet search . For example for well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of current and future televisions ? # ME: So we can see what needs to be supported . # ME: and we can interview current users and future users . What w what would they like to see on a new remote control ? especially for future users , I'm thinking of early adopters , because they use new technology first , and they play with a lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to add . # PM: And you can get that information ? # ME: I think I can get that information , . # PM: That would be very handy . # PM: but have you any idea so far as what the user requirements are ? # ME: No n not specifically . # ME: More to how to get them # UI: I got some requirements it has it has to be user-friendly . # UI: really easy to use buttons , not very small buttons , but not the also the big buttons , but just normal buttons . # UI: It has to be a small unit . # UI: It has to be you can take it with you everywhere in your house . # UI: So it has n has not to be l , gigantic machine . # UI: and a and a good zapping range . # PM: what do you mean by that ? # UI: the distance from your television to your remote control has to be , yeah , quite a big distance . # UI: It has to be capable for zapping # ME: From the other end of the room or something ? # PM: Okay Well I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment . # PM: I think the best is to go to work . # ID: Is that you alright . # ME: Any more points to discuss ? # PM: I think we can go ahead with what we have . # PM: I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder . # PM: the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design , etcetera . # PM: And it seems you get more information by email . # PM: that was it for me . # UI: Are you going to put the notes on the # PM: , in the project folder . # PM: I'm writing very fast . # PM: Hope it's readable . # PM: anything more you want to add to the discussion ? # ID: I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next session ? # UI: Do we only have to do phase one , the functional design ? # PM: Because then we have a # UI: After that we are going to the conceptual # PM: Y you do some individual work , # ME: We're just working the three phases . # PM: we have meeting , individual work , meeting . # PM: And at the end of the day we have a final meeting . # PM: And then I have to prepare I have to defend our design , so make it good . # ID: okay . We'll do our best . # PM: I depend on you . # ME: Better make it # ID: I am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in . # PM: ? If you can mix it it's okay . # ID: I mean , is it gonna be a multimedia control centre ? # ID: Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ? # ME: . That is my question also because like new functions # PM: I think that is the user requirements part . # ME: Requirements . # PM: As to what they want . do they want all those functions on that small # ID: But but we need good communication about this stuff , 'cause I have to f put the components into the design . # UI: I would first m # ID: So if I don't know what components to put in , it's kind of hard . # PM: I understand . # UI: I think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can expand them . # PM: You can always add a few # ME: like l li like some like some remotes who are out there , which I know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices . # ME: So you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video . # PM: the C_D_ player . # ME: And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre , because that's getting very popular . # ME: And then use your Windows media centre under your T_V_ with the same remote control . So with the switch , one single switch # ID: I know what you mean , but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player . # ID: You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function . # ID: And you don't need that for a T_V_ . # ME: records and stuff like that . # ID: And and for a t teletext you need additional buttons as well , # PM: You need additional # ID: so I kind of need to know what we need . # ID: Whatever , I'll just put my ideas in here and then we can discuss it with the next meeting . # ME: In the project # PM: We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video . # PM: And reserve the possibility to add other features . # PM: So we have a basic starting point and you can always extend that so make sure it's extendible . # UI: it has it has to be user-friendly . # UI: So it's hasn't it's . # PM: Th the least amount of functions possible so it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera . # ID: I understand . # PM: and I'll see you again when the computer tells us to . # PM: , you're di dismissed . # UI: Can we leave now # ME: Alright let's move on . # PM: Let's see what we got to do . # ID: See you later . # ME: see you later .
# PM: You all saw the newsflash ? # PM: Or you got the same message ? # ME: I just saw it one minute ago . # ID: I didn't see it yet I think . # UI: Newsflash ? D did I miss something ? # PM: I received an email so I thought I can't mail you so I thought I'd just drop it in the folder , but # ID: Hey what's wrong with my computer ? # PM: Is it unlocked ? # ME: that's my presentation . # PM: I kind of opened it . # UI: I think you have to change your desktop # PM: 'Kay . Everybody ready ? # UI: computer is not functioning ? # ID: Okay . Where do I find this ? # ID: I'm not so g display huh ? # UI: And then settings ? # UI: Mm I'm not sure I . # ME: You read the newsflash ? # PM: 'Kay . Can we get started # ID: what was it about ? # PM: or is there some pressing issue ? # ID: my computer is not functioning properly . # PM: Oh no pressing . # PM: Did you plug in the power cable when you come back ? # ID: No but my screen is reduced in size . # PM: That's difficult . # ME: So it doesn't draw the attention away . # ID: This is dreadful . # UI: I made uh my own map . # ID: No not this , but the task . # PM: You have Playstation also ? # ID: No that's okay . # ID: No I just flapped it , closed it , took it here and then this happened . # ID: where was it ? In settings ? # ID: Okay . Alright . # ID: Do you guys like your tasks ? # ID: I spent a lot of time thinking about what I was gonna do and then a couple of minutes before this I get my function you know the information that I need . # UI: wa you actually But it it's not clear what you have to type in your presentation . # ID: So frustrating . # ME: I had a whole idea and then just was typing it and then oh . I have to do that so switch . # ID: This presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause I hadn't time to intergrate tha the information yet so Really annoying . # PM: Okay . So there we are again . # ME: By your humble P_M_ . # PM: Okay this is the agenda . # PM: we have three presentations , I heard . # PM: So who wants to start ? # ME: We have to start it right away ? # ME: Functional ? functional requirements . # ME: I'm gonna talk about functional requirements . # ME: Well some research has be done has been done . # ME: observing of one hundred subjects in the usability lab using a remote control . # ME: and they also filled in a questionnaire . # ME: The findings were , well you can see them for yourself . # ME: They disliked the look-and-feel of current remotes controls . # ME: Users think they're ugly . # ME: they do not match the operating behaviour of the users . # ME: So they d they don't match what they want to have on it . # ME: they are often lost somewhere in the room . # ME: it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . # ME: And they're bad for R_S_I_ . # ME: I don't know how a user can reach that but okay . # ME: there is also was also some research on the most relevant and irrelevant f functions . # ME: most irrelevant and less used were audio settings , mono , stereo , pitch , bass . # ME: screen settings for brightness and colour and stuff like that . # ME: but they are used . # ID: So they do need to be in the # ME: they do need to be on the on the remote control . # ME: I mean if you can't control the sound settings I mean if you dislike a very loud bass or something , you need to change that . # ID: By the way my T_V_ doesn't have an equ equaliser but # ME: We c we c I mean w we can't # PM: Next generation does . # ME: but we can leave them away . # ME: most relevant , most used functions , they speak for themselves I guess . # ME: power button , channel , volume selection . # ME: teletext but we can skip that because I saw the newsflash , and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used any more in the future . # PM: N not used anymore . # ME: So forget this one . # ME: channel settings , so for programming your channels in the right order . # ID: By the way where did you guys get that newsflash from ? # UI: . I was wondering # ID: I didn't get anything . # ME: , on the project # PM: I receiv the mail but you don't . So # UI: But you you've got more information than . # ME: No so it's a text file n in the project folder . # ME: So teletext can be skipped . # PM: That's in the presentation , so # ME: there was some research on new features in a remote control . # ME: about an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . # ME: Well we got an update for the for the audience . Or the targeted group . # ME: So it's above forty I guess . # PM: below I believe . # ME: The new product ? # ME: because that's pretty relevant . # ME: I thought I read a # PM: Our current customers are in the age group forty plus . # PM: And the new product should reach new markets , which is the customers below forty . # UI: But where did you get that information ? # PM: That's in a newsflash . # ME: that's in the newsfla okay that's a good to know . # ME: because you see a clear distinction between the age groups , concerning the features . # ME: I mean above forty people are not so interested not so interested in a screen or speech recognition . # ME: but below that age they pretty much are . # ME: So I think we can build that in . # ME: well we can skip this part as well , because I thought I read above forty so we could skip the features , but we just have to build them in because they find it very interesting . # ME: well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible . # ME: and also there's so not only the design of the bus buttons but o how you can push them , and stuff like that . So the physical aspect of it . # ME: And I think and certainly for the for the lower age groups , nice design , which does not make the remote control in your room . # ME: It's it's actually a part of your interior , of your design in your room . # ME: So it's the people can say , well what's that , well that's my remote control , so it's d it has to look nice and feel nice , and have all the functions that # PM: But it also needs to have corporate identity . # ME: so the logo has to be # PM: Present and the colours . # ME: present , and the colours as well . # PM: So we can't change much of that . # ME: so but I don't think that's a problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway , and most of the times there is a brand present on it . # ME: So I think that's not gonna affect it very much . # ME: Well that are the consequences on a marketing part . # PM: It's open already so you can use to find yours . # PM: You pressed alt F_ four ? # UI: No no . I pressed the mouse button . # ID: that's the self-destruct button . # PM: maybe you can do it from your computer so talk us through it . # UI: if you all go stand around Computer # UI: I had two examples . # UI: this one is the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons . # UI: This the easy one I think we have to combine them . And merge the best functions of all examples . # UI: but the age is under forty ? # ME: and marketing research stated that kind of users are not afraid of a lot of functions . # UI: Okay so we have the option for more functions . # ME: So not too much but . # ID: And we do have to integrate the screen and the speech # ME: And the speech recognition . # UI: this one we can remove for kids . # UI: It's just only for adults so we can use some advanced options . # ME: from age of sixteen so . # UI: but I prefer we use the basic options . # UI: We have to make them very easy so for just zapping around the channels you can just push one button . # UI: But if you want to use your video recorder or something else , you should use an advanced option . # ME: but the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device , only your television . # UI: Okay one device . # PM: So n it's very easy . # UI: Okay . I didn't see . # UI: Okay and I also . W . # ME: So there are not extra options in this case , but # UI: We have to make it fashionable . Like you said before . # UI: the basic functions . # UI: only use a extra function if they are really needed . # PM: so maybe you can hide them or something . # ME: well what we can do with the screen is all the configuration options , you can put that in the screen . # PM: you make a screen menu or something . # ME: And the and the screen menu to do that , and then the basic function just on the device itself . # ME: So it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen , with a clear menu . # PM: and the other oth other functionality is the screen . # PM: What does the screen do ? # PM: It's low power . # UI: did I break it ? # PM: So what does the screen do ? # PM: They said they needed it but what does it do ? # PM: What do they want with the screen ? # UI: For for the advanced functions I think . # PM: that's what we make it up . # ME: well it didn't # PM: So but what did the marketing # ME: it didn't say what they want to do with the screen . # ME: Well I , my guess is it's pretty handy for advanced functions . # PM: okay it's handy . # PM: With no predefined # UI: Like searching for channels and # ME: searching for channels , programming them . # ID: We have your oh never mind . # PM: We're back online . # UI: I'm al I'm almost finished so we have to watch out for the i if we make it f very fashionable , it the functional functionality will go down . # UI: So we have to make a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable # PM: Content and form . # UI: content and form . # UI: Now that was the end . # PM: That was the end . # ID: Well my presentation is a bit sucky . # ME: Well you can improvise right ? # PM: which one is it ? Technical functions ? # PM: Functional requirements ? # ID: I think that would be it then . # PM: You didn't put it in ? Or # ID: I have no idea . # ME: So we can go for # PM: it's not really English . # PM: Oh working design I got it . # ME: So we can go for the look-and-feel of the left example , and then a screen on top of it . # ID: Alright how do I skip pages ? # ID: well I was working on this before I got my information . # ID: So I was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about remote controls . # ID: And well the info on the website which came too late . # ID: so I didn't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet . # ID: So uh this is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last meeting . # ID: Those were my starting points . # ID: I was working on a s on a schedule , and I was supposed to do it like this . # ID: But then the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow , so I was trying to organise them for myself . # ID: And then make the # ID: the design , a the actual design , # ID: but I never came around to do that . # ID: So I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say about it . # ID: I mean everything speaks for itself I guess . # ID: Mean you press a button the it tru goes , it sends a signal to a chip , which translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies . # ID: And or temporal fr frequencies actually . # ID: And then through a transformer , it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the to the receiver on the T_V_ # ID: and the T_V_ will translate it into a function . # ID: well this was actually all I got around to do . # ID: I mean I dunno if I'm too slow for this stuff , but # UI: Okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want # ME: we want to incorporate in into it . # PM: for those that didn't see yet the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext , only for T_V_ . # PM: it should be designed for a use g group below forty , but I don't think it's w wrong if we can target the current customer group as well . # PM: And the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control . # PM: And we have to decide on the functions , and on the , let's see what was it , the target group . # PM: We have to make be clear what that is . # ME: group of users , or because it says below forty I mean . # PM: so I think it's easy but # ME: I guess that's the tar or male and female # UI: But it's also for children or just # PM: it's below forty so we can decide where to # ME: the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen . # ME: Sixteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , thirty five to forty five , something like that . # PM: So below forty is okay . # PM: But we need an lower level which to s focus . # ME: How do you mean ? # PM: So is it from sixteen to forty ? Is it from twenty to forty ? Is it from thirty ? # ME: sixteen to forty . # ME: Well I guess people of sixteen are quite used to technology . # ME: So they adapt to it pretty soon I guess . # UI: And if we have a larger public we have more options to sell our product . # ID: so what we might wanna do is cust I have customised the screen functions , if you know what I mean . # ID: The younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines so they can use more advanced functions . # ID: But maybe elderly people don't understand it so well , so they need a simpler remote . # ID: And that you can choose what the design displays , or wha whatever . # UI: that's why I wanted to make two different groups of functions . # UI: The the simple functions for the whole public , and the advanced options for the younger people who are more experienced with # ID: Experienced . # ME: But all incorporated in the screen or just on the remote itself ? # UI: I w I should put the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display . # ME: like you have a visual of the of the brightness with a kind of sliding bar and a bus and stuff like that for sound and vis and visuals ? # PM: So is you should have a menu for all the functions you don't use regular and which are # ME: you can make a if you make a drawing . # ME: And draw it very big . # PM: no , it doesn't have line control , so we get the # ME: well , this is basically it's # ME: alright the remote ? # ME: well usually the power button is on top I guess . # PM: Which should be easy , easily reached with the thumb . # ME: so it should fit right in into your hand . # UI: L left top or right top ? # PM: T I s should said right . # ME: I most people are right-handed so # ME: maybe left-handed special addition , but okay . # ME: If you put it like here . Or something . # ME: then you could put a screen , like on a mobile phone , also on top I guess . # UI: but if you are using the normal functions , the basic functions , you normally press them on the u . # PM: Do the also with the thumb . # PM: So it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your thumb , also reach the middle . # PM: Or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly . # ME: Okay so y you have you have it in your hand , and the screen is below , and the buttons are in the middle . # PM: You you need to be able to hold it so # ME: Okay for example if you put the screen here , it's more about the functions now than the than the layout . # PM: okay that's true . Layout . # PM: That's for the # ME: Doesn't work too well . # PM: I can't help it . # ME: Okay you get it . # ME: for example if y if you put all the # PM: You want the normal piece of paper ? And you have a pen ? # ID: And might be easier huh ? # ME: Maybe this . kind of works . # ME: Like if you have like ten buttons for all the for all the channels , and here one for # PM: And the for flipping up and down . # UI: And volume control . # ME: that usually like here , here , here , here . # ME: So you have up and down for the for the channels , and left and right for the volume # PM: And left to right . # PM: And those can also be used for the menu . # ID: I thought but this is really your department , that we need just the functional display and four cursors . # PM: okay but this is function so if you can use them for multiple things # ME: And you have most of the time you have one button in the middle . It says menu , # ME: and then if you press it you the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into functon and then just mo most of the time this menu button is also like okay , to confirm a kind of action . # ME: So you scroll into it , okay . # ME: You select a function like v like bass . # ME: You just adjust it with these two buttons . # ME: Then okay to confirm , and then on each on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level . # ME: And then finally say okay , exit . # ME: Or or one button to exit it . # ME: in one time I dunno , that's not really my department . # UI: And do we need a logo on our remote control , or # ME: That's more your department to But it should be if the screen is here then the logo should be like on top , # UI: On the left top . # PM: but that depends on where you put the screen . # PM: But it's essential that there is a screen . # ME: I mean the position of the screen is also more essential than I mean we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there . # PM: And for the speech recognition part , if we want to incorporate that , we need a microphone . # ME: so it should be I mean if you have it in your hand here , should be on top somewhere , maybe . # PM: This would be # ID: Why did we wanna put the display in the bottom ? # PM: No that's not s sure so # ME: That's not sure # PM: we need a display . # UI: may maybe because you're # ID: Because if you use the functions your hand will block the display . # UI: okay but only for the basic functi if you're going to use the advanced option , you're going to press the menu button and then . # ME: I mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me . # ID: Normal for logical t # ME: Also because people use m mobile phones and they also have the screen on top . # PM: they're used to it . # UI: Okay the . That's possible . # ME: So you just have to reach a little bit for the power button . # ME: I mean if you grab it . # ID: On once it's on it's on . You don't need the power button . # ME: But most of the times if a if a T_V_'s on standby people just press a channel to put it on . # UI: Okay we put it on top . # ME: So we put this on top , and then make the corporate logo like over here . R_R_ . # ME: And j and the microphone , I mean it can be very small . # ME: If you look at your mobile phones are some stripes , little holes . # ID: Maybe on the top or even on the side . # ME: maybe on the side . I mean if the if the microphone is good . # PM: but then it's possible that you cover it with your hand so # ME: okay . So on the on the top is better . # PM: I think that top is the best option . # ID: But if you if you hold the ma the remote like this , if you put it on the top on the side I dunno . Should be able to work . # PM: Depends on the sensitivity of the microphone , but I think that's okay . # ID: Can we leave this up to you ? # ME: it doesn't matter that much . # ME: but the screen is on top ? # ME: Which functions did we have left ? # ME: I mean this is basically numbers , volume , channel up and down . # PM: Channel up and down , and the control of the advanced options . # ME: Screen is over there . # PM: So maybe it , we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the L_C_D_ screen . # ME: That's that's a good one . # ID: so we needed to integrate the sound and image options right ? # ID: Like bass so we need kind of an equaliser . # ME: So if you have sound But not too advanced . # ME: I mean most T_V_s use only treble and bass . # UI: it it's just a remote control so # ID: treble , middl middle , bass or something . # PM: They're not used often so # ME: It's pretty hard to write . # ME: Okay but you have sound ? # ME: oh y you have digital better write it down over there . # PM: I'm just a secretary . # ME: So you have sound . # ME: sound and then within sound I guess treble and bass ? # ID: the mono stereo option ? # ID: And there was something else also . # PM: Pitch I believe , . # ID: And then pitch . # ME: But pitch , isn't that that's the height of the tone . # ID: The fr the frequency of the tones , . # PM: and mono stereo . # ME: wh why would you use that ? # ID: isn't that depends on the on the signal of the of what program you're watching . # ME: If people like talk like # PM: And also the tuning part ? # ME: Programming part . # PM: programming . # PM: So channel programming ? # ME: so we have sound , ? Channel programming . # ID: And in the functionality of the # UI: Television itself # ID: no of the remote do we want the buttons to make sound when you press them ? As a confirmation or whatever you know ? # ME: I think it g it gets annoying . # ME: I mean most mobile phones used that in the beginning but # UI: We we could make an option for it , but you can disable s # ID: Under the a advanced option menu you can put those things . # UI: But the television itself has also the options brightness and screen colour etcetera . So # ME: but people don't want to sit on their knees on their knees in front of their television with only three buttons then it's very hard to # ME: y contrast and brightness ? # ME: those are the most used I guess . If you look at your monitor . # PM: And the others were in your presentation right ? # PM: So I can just copy those ? # ME: Well well I guess that these were the only ones , I guess . # PM: Okay . It's easy . # ID: But so we have we have T_V_ options , which is all this . # ME: I will look it up . # PM: the button options and the L_C_D_ options . # ID: The sound , sound and image . # ID: And you have in that the indeed the remote control options . # ID: So we need two menus kind of thing . # PM: you have basically a button menu , which you can use directly , according to the old principle . # PM: And the L_C_D_ options are activated by some software options , thats communicates with the infrared decoder . # ME: with the chip and then I mean # PM: You have an additional processor and software part . # ME: Well we have power button , whether that's present . # PM: Compared to o # ME: Channel volume selection present . # ME: numbers present . # ME: a audio settings , mono , stereo , pitch , bass , treble . Screen settings , brightness and colour . # PM: I call it contrast . # ME: con contrast is # PM: I make it c colour . # ME: okay , colour and brightness . # ME: and what you say , channel settings or channel programming ? # ME: So you have an option to start scanning all the frequencies , and when it encounters one , well it shows on your T_V_ . And then you can # PM: and automatically # ME: and then you can select a number in your remote on which you want to save it . # PM: so I've g channel program is autoseek ? # PM: name a channel , or # ME: Well most T_V_s automatically display the name , which they get through the cable . # PM: Oh they get automatic names , okay . # ME: So you only have to choose the position on your It only has to match the channel frequency on your T_V_ , with the with the position on your T_V_ and so your remote . # PM: but can you also say I want f Veronica on the channel number five or # ME: If you already programmed it . # ME: If you want to move it . that should be possible too . # PM: How do you call that ? # ME: how do you call that ? # ME: Wait you should be able to browse through a list or something , which w displays all the all the values , all the channels which are possible . # ME: I mean like one to f thirty of or ninety or whatever . # PM: Ninety nine or something . # ME: Just browse through it and then in some kind of way see if it if it if it is programmed . # PM: S swap channels ? # PM: Can I call it that ? # ME: Swap channels . # PM: Swap's good option . # PM: other functions ? # ME: most of the time if you if you swap it S let's say for example you have R_T_L_ five on channel five . And Veronica on channel eight and you want to move Veronica to channel five , most of the times you override the previous the previous one . # PM: Well that's 's up to Mister User Interface Designer . # ME: It's it's pretty I mean you have to look on the menu # ID: working design . Doch . # ID: He only has to figure out how it has to look . # PM: but also , which buttons you have to press to get a certain result ? # PM: And the working design was to specify how ph the physical interation between the components was , as I believe . # ID: You did your homework . But . Okay . # ME: Or or is it too hard to ju to just do it all on your remote ? To programme the channels ? # PM: No I don't think so . # ID: No no . It should be able to do any remote . # PM: But I think the communication with the television is difficult . # PM: But that's not our part . # PM: We don't have to design a protocol so # ME: That's true . That's true . # ME: So we have a figure a figure out a way to do that easily . # ME: I mean th the autoseek is not a problem . # ME: I mean you current channel and then it just says , on which number do you want to save this , and you just press a number on your remote , and then say confirm , okay , and then it's saved . # ME: It's easier , it's harder to , if you have already programmed it , to swap . # ME: So we have to think of something for that . # PM: The User Interface Designer can design a menu for all these function I put them on the # ME: k kind of structure into layers . # UI: can you i make a map with all the 'cause it's now there are lots and lots of documents # PM: I'll just try to reorganise things . # PM: So you design the basic function menu for the L_C_D_ screen ? # ME: And and the layout of the thing itself . # PM: th I think the layout of the screen # UI: The the layout of the remote control ? # PM: and I think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the screen itself on the # UI: Isn't that more the u the user interface part ? # PM: No I d I think that's more in # ID: all the functional aspects of the remote I think are in my department . # ME: Maybe more on # ID: I have to know what it has to do , so if you wanna you know the changing the channels kind of s thing is , I have to integrate that in the design . # PM: Okay . So he's layout and you're function . # PM: Form function okay . # ID: I think that's a that's a good separation . # UI: But do I have to make the menu layout also ? Or Are you going to do that ? # UI: ? I I'm going to make # PM: I think i that's your department yes , because w he already knows what # ID: we have to kind of work together . # ID: If if I make the menu like , I have to state which function has to be in the menu , # PM: But we're not allowed . # ID: and then you have to decide , it's , in a in a way that b is user-friendly . # UI: Y you are going to make a list of what functions are going to be on the screen , the menu screen . # UI: And I'm going to make a nice menu with pages and . # ME: With with some l with some layers in it . # PM: and also make clear which buttons to press to get certain result , # ME: So some menus . # PM: because that's always the difficulty . # PM: Every device has its own # ME: Well I guess this button , the okay , # ME: Or you can incorporate two difference different buttons . # ME: like for your mobile phone . # ME: so this is only for to get in the menu , or to exit it . # ME: And then one to confirm , and one to go one step back . # ME: So it's like the save button on your mobile phone , if you have a Nokia or like that . # ME: Or the or the no button . # ME: To go one step back you it's only two extra buttons , but if it if it's very clear that they are for the screen # UI: I think we have to group , to make two groups . # UI: the one group for the for the display , and one group for the basic functions , # PM: but they're incorporated ? # PM: Up and down is # UI: but we have a m # ME: because this is used for both . # UI: but maybe that's not if you're if you're z zapping with your remote control , you can press the menu button , and then you are suddenly into the display . # ME: Into your screen . Okay . # ID: You wanna separate # ME: l should leave the menu button out of here . # ME: And and just put it under the screen , the screen # UI: j just group the we make these the advanced functions and these the basic functions . # UI: So we make a line between them . # ME: But we should place the screen on top , right ? # UI: F oh . Okay we swap Okay . # PM: But that's J Jurgen's department . # UI: So we make it a # ME: You just you just find out and . # PM: You just make the layout . # PM: do we do the extra two buttons or not ? # ID: I think you should . # ID: If you put too many functions in one button it gets confusing . # PM: okay . That's true . # UI: So we have a menu button and a s # PM: And to , okay and back , also . # UI: Okay . Okay and back button . # ME: , or confirm and back . Whatever . # PM: And of course the four arrows . # PM: But those are still y doubly used . # ME: Should we save this picture , or you know what it looks like ? # UI: I'm not s clear about the extra two buttons . # UI: We have a menu button and # ME: That that just to activate the screen . So # UI: That's the one with the # PM: Menu button access the menu in the L_C_D_ screen . # ME: And then with these buttons , woa , y you navigate . # PM: You can navigate . # PM: But you can also navigate the channels . And the volume . # UI: so that that's not that Those are # PM: Those are both # UI: multifunctional . # ID: Hey is it interesting for users if we put LED lights under the buttons ? So that if you press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up . # PM: Oh five minutes . # ME: That's very good idea . # ME: that's a good idea because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now , which you can use . # ID: and then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button . # PM: Anything else ? # ME: Those buttons are lit up . # ME: But just one thing . # ME: Should we use those two ? Them ? Or only this to scroll ? # ME: And then use the two functional buttons to confirm , to go into something ? # ME: Oh no we have to use this to adjust some bars ? # ID: keep it optional 'cause maybe you can you know go left to right and up and down in a in one menu . # ME: And maybe we should use this also as an okay button , still . And then just only a back button . # PM: Well we have those buttons . We use all four . # ID: The pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is , # PM: okay go ahead . # ID: sorry , is if you're pressing up and down , you can easily press the okay once you , when you're not already at your choice . # UI: So maybe make one okay button and one navigation button . # PM: that was already decided . # UI: the with the channel and the volume m a multifunctional navigation button . # PM: Okay that's what we decided earlier on . # PM: Right okay . So # ID: You wanna close down huh ? # PM: I wanna close down . # PM: I have to , sorry . # PM: it's not because I don't like you but # PM: yh we have lunch break , # PM: and then we can work for thirty minutes , and I have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes . # PM: And then we'll see # ID: How m how long is the lunchbreak ? # PM: Nobody told me . # ME: We have to ask . # UI: But do we have to write to write down the our stuff now ? Or first lunchbreak ? # PM: No I th believe there's first lunch break . # UI: Because I I've everything in my head now so # PM: Or you can just I think you can put the laptop back in the room and # ME: Time pressure . # PM: it's a lot of pressure . # ID: Sorry for my not finished presentation . # ME: we'll kick your ass later . No . # PM: I don't know if it works but it should be saved . # ME: Y you saved it ? # ME: Does it save automatically in the project folder ? Or Okay . We'll see . # PM: Should be here . Smart board . # ME: Just put back my laptop . # PM: Don't know if you can use it but # ME: you can open it with the picture preview or stuff like that . # UI: And we have to make some maps with the all the data we gathered . # PM: I try to organise it by these three . # UI: . It's it's just my own map so I put everything into the # PM: I don't really mind . # PM: I just put the minutes here and we'll see . # UI: But you got some extra information # PM: that's in the functional design folder . # PM: that's just basically what I just showed . # UI: But where do you did you get the newsflash ? # UI: You're the only one okay . # PM: I'm gonna get kicked if I don't do it so # PM: Make me proud . # ID: So first we have a lunchbreak now ? # ID: I dunno where she .
# ME: English from now on . # PM: just testing . # ID: Just kidding . # PM: Break is over . # ME: Where are all the other presentations ? # ID: I just put it in the in the shared folder so it should be # ME: The conceptual or # ID: I think so . , conceptual design . # ID: What or whatever does it # ME: . Because I see only my own presentation # ID: No no , can you go back one ? # ID: 'cause it has to be PowerPoint pre components design , that's it . # ME: I'll just put it in there . # PM: So , he's coming . # ID: . I did get a bit more done than the last time , # ID: 'cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copy and paste everything into the # ME: I can't cut and paste it into the other folder but # PM: You can look at the final report , 'cause I have to record everything we are deciding and such , so I'm trying to write it down between everything else . # ME: Move to meeting room . # ID: Sometimes I have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there , and also with I don't know how to use PowerPoint , so it takes me forever to get something done with it . # UI: I I've got the same problem as well . # PM: Here we go again . # PM: we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to f the remote control has to support . # PM: So who wants go . # ID: Who wants to start ? # ME: Me first again or # PM: sure . Doesn't matter . # UI: Oh . No . No problem # ME: Did you open it already or So welcome to the marketing presentation once again . # ME: this time about trendwatching . # ME: well there has been inv investigation again , in the in the remote control market . # ME: it shows a number of developments . # ME: I will address them in a moment . # ME: fashion watch watchers have detected the trends for young public , because that's our public . # ME: fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing , shoes and furniture . # ME: And the feel of the material is expected to be spongey . # ME: So the developments I will address them oh well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours . # ME: So to give you an idea . # ME: well the developments ? # ME: development one . # ME: most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel . Instead of the current functional look-and-feel . # ME: well fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and the interface . # ME: And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological innovative . # ME: well it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls . # ME: I think we pretty much covered that with our screen and speech recognition , so I don't expect that to be a problem . # ME: And the third development is that the remote control should be easy to use . # ME: Well the first aspect was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect . # ME: So that kind of gets you this ratios . # ME: So fancy look-and-feel is the most important point of attention . # ME: so the fruits and vegetables in combination with the spongey material . # ME: well technolog technological innovation , we've covered that pretty much I guess . # ME: and easy to use , I don't think that will be problem . # ME: So my point of attention is especially this part . # ME: That this will be a crux . # ME: So that was the marketing presentation . # ME: I had only one document left . # ID: And shall I go first ? # UI: No . I don't mi I don't mind . # ME: So kind of this # UI: Do you want to go first ? Okay . # ME: So a k a small example . # ME: Kind of this look . # ME: nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing , and some fruit and colours I dunno . # ME: Just made a quick design . # PM: you're just the user interface ? # UI: It's better than my drawing . # UI: okay but I have to design the # PM: You probably opened it . # ID: Alright . So I'm dealing with the components design . # ID: I used some design examples we had from similar products . # ID: And I used possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design . # ID: That's why I had to , wanted to go first . # ID: Well they gave me an idea about what people want . # ID: We're f mainly focusing on this group , but I want to make the distinction clear . # ID: I could not drag the pictures into the slides so s so I don't have examples of how it looks like . # ID: But it comes down to what you what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking type . # ID: If you , the young dynamic people want soft primary colours , which looks like fruits you know , you can and shapes that are curved and not solid straight lines anymore . # ID: So this basically goes on to what you were mentioning earlier . # ID: There is a lot of factors involved in choosing the components . # ID: There's a lot of options that we have to discuss . # ID: for example the energy source . we have four types . # ID: The basic battery . # ID: we have a hand dynamo , which we Dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt . # ID: the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing , if you shake it . # ID: Which will be fun for toddlers right , if they wanna use the And of course solar cells . # ID: But I dunno how we would use that into the design of the actual product . # ME: Wi an indoors . # PM: Calculator's can do it . # ID: also in you know countries where there's n isn't much light like in Scandinavia , they wouldn't be y able to use it half of the year you know . # ID: So that's not cool either . # ID: for the a case , there's the traditional uncurved flat hard case . # ID: Single curved , which means that it has curves in one dimension . # ID: Or the double curved . # ID: I wasn't able to finish my personal preferences sheet , but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now . # ID: the case materials . # ID: Well we have all kinds of hard materials like the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium . # ID: I would definitely go for rubber 'cause it fits most in what people wanna see nowadays . # ID: this is a lot of text . # ID: I wasn't able to organise this yet . # ID: We have several interface designs . # ID: we can use a scroll buttons for the menus , but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons , for the arrow buttons . # UI: Pushbuttons . # ID: So that's not really interesting . # ID: Electronics ? # ID: maybe we wanna decide on what electronics to use the advanced chip I think is easiest to implement for the production , 'cause they can print it better . # ID: I think this is about it . # ID: I was working on some per personal preferences . # ID: I first chose for the battery , 'cause I'm traditional and that's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to . # ID: But I really think that we should maybe think about the kinetic energy , where you have to move the thing to be able to use it . # UI: As an optional feature . # UI: Or combine both with a with one # PM: I think you can only fit one source of energy on the # ME: I guess we can only choose one . # ID: I can imagine that the kinetic type energy source would be more expensive to make . # ID: But it is more longlasting , that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again . # ME: And it's more fun . # PM: I didn't receive any info . # ID: And it's also more fun . # ID: I always chuck my remote control around , so # ME: just playing with it and especially when the material's rubber . It can be done , I mean , you can't harm it , # ME: so it's a perfect combination I guess . # ID: You don't have to be scared about bouncing it off the g floor and breaking it or whatever . # ID: So that's the end of it . # ME: So double curved is like this , this , this , or # ID: No it means curved in two dimensions . # ID: So w single curved ? let's say would be a b square box , but then with curves on one dimension . # ID: And double curved would means that it would have curves in every direction . Like three D_ . # ME: Also in height ? # UI: One one very important thing I was thinking about is the speech option . # UI: We were going to use that . # UI: that's one thing which I'm not sure of how to implement it into the remote control . # PM: Well the visual representation is not there with speech # UI: No okay but it has to be combined with the menu for functions and # PM: I think you can just match the speech commands with the functions that are already present . # PM: So I don't think you have to design anything else for that . # ME: with the programme . # UI: But do j do we do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ? # UI: For for everything , also for the advanced options ? Okay . # UI: we have this very basic trendy design . # UI: Everybody says it so that's what's in the in the last meeting we were putting the simple and the advanced options separated . # UI: That's obvious . # UI: Pressing the menu option will disable all other options on your remote control . # UI: And only the L_C_D_ panel will light up and then you can only change the options . # ME: And and the and the buttons that you need to control it , I guess . # UI: design has to be very attractive but that's your op your . # UI: you have to delete this but this is the simple layout . # UI: display on the upper side with the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button . # PM: That would be the back . # PM: Back and okay . # UI: Back and okay . # ME: Back and okay . # PM: You did read the minutes I wrote ? # PM: You did read the minutes I wrote ? # UI: A little bit I think but not everything w # PM: Oh okay 'cause I pretty much summed up all the buttons there were . So # UI: Oh I didn't read that . # PM: I hate doing work for nothing . # UI: But this is the basic design for the for the m for the buttons . # UI: I wanted to categorise everything . # UI: with a speech display , sound , everything you noted in your minutes . # UI: every pushbutton has its own LED light . # UI: So you can change m make it more trendy for younger people . # UI: And if there are older people they wanted more luxurous so that's an a also an option . # PM: Okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use ? # PM: energy source , chip type , case type . And user interface . # PM: But I didn't see a clear distinction between these so I think what we have is okay . # PM: So we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy . # PM: the case would be doubly curved . So # ID: And rubber . Rubber material . # ME: Rubber material . # PM: Rubber material . # PM: And that's the only thing we have left . # ID: we need the chip on print to be able to support the screen and f audio function . # PM: Oh okay . No it's easy . # ME: So that's is that is that the advanced chip ? # PM: Advanced chip . Okay . # ID: Otherwise you would have a simple chip , just for pressing buttons . But we need more . # ID: I'm just thinking , this is not my department , but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost , # ME: Kinetic . Double curved . # ID: to be able to m # PM: I didn't get any info on this . So # ID: So 'cause we need to sell it for twenty five Euro a piece . # ID: That's gonna be difficult huh ? # ME: The cost of making it should be twelve and a half ? # PM: I have total here . # PM: I didn't get any information about that so # UI: We're going to produce it in China so it's no problem . # ID: Child labour man , we love it . # PM: let's see . Is there a new thing ? # ME: well the interface type supplements . # PM: the interface , maybe can # UI: it's quite difficult because we haven't got all the options . # PM: do you have a picture of doubly curved case ? # PM: And could you put that in the group folder ? Of the project folder . # ME: If you go to your homepage or something , you should # ID: I'm going there now . # ME: get your own information . # ID: Inspiration . # ME: I got my fresh and fyoo fruity picture also over there , so # PM: you didn't draw it yourself . # ME: Too less time . # ME: , also the menu . # UI: This is the menu I was looking at . # ME: I was thinking of that also , with a with a arrow . # ID: Maybe it's easier # ME: So that indicates that there's an menu under that menu . # PM: 'S the target group . # ID: Maybe it's easier if you guys come over here . # ID: S see this is the standard traditional type , where the form serves the function , you know . # ID: It's like really basic . # ID: But this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that . # ID: This is what we're looking for . # ID: And th that means curved in both dire dimensions . # ID: Not only like this but it has to be # PM: also like this . So you can hold it . # ID: It has to be kind of instead of the PlayStation , the module . It has to be like the Game Cube , you know , where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold . And # UI: But it has also to it has also to be luxurous for rich people . # UI: Th this looks a little bit like for only for children . So # PM: The children's story . I've got it . # ID: but that's the problem the dilemma actually , # PM: Distinction . # ID: 'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours , and with a lot of shape . # ID: and the and the rubber , it will look cheap always , # UI: The colour Okay but the colours , you can make it make the colours with LEDs beneath the buttons . # ID: you know , with the # UI: If you press a button and you can disable the colour LEDs for people that don't like it . # ID: There is mobile phones , in which you can change the colour also of the lights . # ID: Maybe we should consider this function . # ID: To customise it and so I mean kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours and people who want something , you know , different , or more design , they can go for one colour # ID: like for example this photo th camera . # ME: S underwater # ID: Personally I think it's really ugly . # ID: Just give me the thing that it's inside there # PM: but this the is for the . # UI: Very cheap look . # ID: maybe I'm too old for this stuff . # ID: So those I think are all my # PM: bright colours . # ME: . Also a kind of rubber # ID: And this is , this is with the curved that I mean . # PM: That's singly curved . # ME: That should be nice . # PM: Well we could make a compromise between that . # PM: But I don't know if it's worth the effort . # ID: A compromise between what ? # PM: instead of doubly curved we take a single curved . So to appeal a little more to the all the public . # ID: This , this would be single curved ? # ME: there's only in this dimension . # ME: Like this . So curvy or not . # ID: Exactly . Exactly . # ME: so we keep it singly c single curved then ? # PM: that would be an option . # PM: I don't know what you think . # ID: I think the I mean our aim is to make something different right ? # ID: To make something new . # ID: I would go for the double curved . # ID: And I I'm thinking you know a drawing palette , where you have the shape for your thumb . # ID: So it kind of holds nicely , something like that . # UI: but if you if you make it more curved we can make more and more options for buttons . # ID: Well this is really your decision but # UI: If you have it have it in your hand , you are not only you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the buttons . # ID: You can make a trigger button or something like that . # UI: Something to shoot at your television # ID: or that is the confirmation button or something , that you scroll with your thumb , with the arrows , and then confirm . # ID: That would be a nice way to use it but I mean , I'm thinking big already , and we need something that well that you can able to use in one hand I think . # PM: Oh a one hand solution . # ME: So from top view it looks kinda like this . # ME: But from the side you can have it also in a kind of shape . # PM: can turn it maybe . # ME: Maybe because the screen is on top you can have # PM: To switch from buttons to interface . If you turn it a little . # ME: Maybe you can c have this kind of shape . # ME: A little upwards . So that the screen is more # PM: Oh . Least you can easily see it . # ME: towards yourself , so you can easily see your screen . # ME: Well well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen . # ME: So then you have double curved in some way . # ME: So this is so the screen is positioned over here . # ME: Something like that . # ME: And the buttons are more , well it's very thick now but # ID: I understand what you mean . # ID: How about we do a pop-up screen , like the laptop . # PM: If you can flip . # ID: So that the only the simple functions will be visible at first . # ME: ? That that you can press it and then it comes up ? Or # ID: And then if you want # PM: so you have a the side view . # ID: Something like that . # ME: But then the side view can be straight . If you have a pop-up screen . # ME: But I dunno if that's too expensive . # PM: So and you want to be able to # ME: I mean maybe it's too much # ID: No like I would draw it like this . # ID: Let's say this is the side view . # ID: That you have a screen that will come up here , and can go down that way . # ID: If you know what I mean . # ID: So that it would come up like that . # PM: Okay so the buttons are on top here , and you flip it over that way . # ID: or preferably even keep the simple buttons here , and then under the screen even you could put more advanced buttons . # PM: Oh . yeah . Right . that's good idea . # ME: Oh the advanced buttons . Right . # UI: the more advanced options were for the for the menu . # ID: F for the L_C_D_ menu right ? # UI: okay . You just want to hide them all ? # PM: No not all because you need most of them , the arrow buttons . # PM: But you can hide the okay and the back button . # PM: And the menu button also because when you flip it open and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto uh automatically . # ID: Activate and th the . # ME: So okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open . # PM: You could just make it mechanical . # ID: But you can make a , you can make a trigger here . # ID: You know a simple with a # ME: and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it , in combination with your # UI: it's not very strong if you drop it one time . # ME: True . It c it can go open . # ID: Well the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever . # PM: If you cover it with rubber . # ME: An adv an adv and it will be covered in some kind of thin rubber layer or something like that . # PM: So it can bounce . # ID: Exactly . Exactly . # ID: We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break . # ME: It's very no it's very strong . # ID: Th it's very solid . # PM: okay so that may work . # ID: That actually will offer some extra protection for the # PM: Okay but then we still have the thing of the shape . # ID: I was thinking , if you have your hand , it this is your th # ME: the lower part doesn't work I guess , so maybe you should try it over there . # ID: If this is your thumb , and this is your hand like that . # ID: With your wrist . # ID: That you , that it would be kind of shape like this , you know . # ID: So it's easier to hold in your hand , to y f # UI: But when you are left-handed , that's a problem . # PM: Maybe can design two versions . # ID: then w then you would have to make it like this . # UI: But that's very expensive # ID: Like like you drew here . # ID: And maybe th then make this thicker also than the centre . # PM: And ergonomical shape . # ID: I would give it a female shape but . Anyway . # PM: The female shape . # ID: Obviously . Make it more appealing to guys . # UI: We we could make some rubber some rubber mouse , with which you can change # ME: but that's optional for later I guess . # ME: I mean , we have to make # ID: but we have hardware inside , which is so it has to have some sort of basic shape . # ME: we better so choose one # ID: And also the screen , you cannot mould it . # ID: You know kind of thing . # ME: so okay we should better choose one sh one shape . # ME: But that's the kind of the idea , # ID: And then you can # ME: so it lays good in the hand , and then on the side with your thumb , # ID: You can place the screen here , which can come . # ME: you can you can use , you can use the button option # PM: So the keywords are primary co colours , spongey ? # ID: And but then I w I would # ID: I would do the arrows here , kind of thing . # ME: Spongey can be reached by means of # ID: Those buttons ? And the simple buttons here , so that # ME: And and the and the control thngs in the middle ? The the arrows ? # ID: I y eah that's what I mean . # UI: No the arrow's over here . # ID: The arrows over here , and here the s simple # ME: and then numbers . # PM: I think that it's a nice design . # ME: pretty nice design . # ME: it looks pretty fancy . # ID: or do we wanna make its shape look like a banana or something ? # ME: bananas wierd shape and other fruits also , so it's better to have some sort of basic print and then a fruit print in some primary colours . # ID: we could make # ME: I don't know what colours should the basic print be like ? # ME: Like some soft green or something ? # PM: Orange or something . # UI: Or blue ? Dark blue or # ME: Oh yeah , dark blue # ID: We should use # ME: and then and then very bright , a yellow banana , an orange , a green apple , stuff like that , with very bright tones I guess . # ID: w we need very primary colours , like bright red , bright yellow . # ME: So you have something like # UI: but the primary colours w we can create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control . # UI: If you make it just a bl give it a blue colour , then it's just a neutral colour , also for the for the more for the people . # ME: That doesn't really work . To draw , I guess . # ME: Oh . What's this ? # PM: N no you have to exit . # PM: You could also make line with # ME: Two hours further . # ME: thickness . Oh . # UI: So that's blue . # ME: Oh . Wh why not go for the twenty ? # ME: That's what I call painting . # ME: So that's a dark blue basic colour I guess . # PM: and then on top of that . # ME: It's pretty nice . # ME: with some yellow banana # PM: Banana colour . # ID: And how about some flashing standby lights ? # ID: Like you have on the Samsung , well I don't like to call brands phones , the you know that 'cause I remember from one of our first meetings that people lose their remote controls often . # ID: So it not only in the colours of the LEDs , that we want something to keep it visible at all times , # ME: How do you mean ? # PM: if you if flashing colour so you can't lose it , basically . # PM: Well I think it's a bit too much but # ME: Well alright well this is more like purple I guess , but it's should be more real dark blue , so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is pretty high . # ME: That would be a nice device I guess . # UI: And which colour should I give the display ? # ME: I mean , the colour of the background of the display ? # ME: well I don't guess it s has to be a sixty six five thousand colour , so too expensive . # PM: And then you can use yellow or semething . # ME: So just a blue backlight or something like that . # ME: Green is too old-fashioned . But blue , blue's okay . J # ID: As long as you loo use high contrast between the background and the foreground colour . # UI: maybe a maybe a white a white backlight ? # ID: So that people with # ME: White backlight , and dark . # UI: Dark letters , . # ME: Whatever which is visible . # ME: I know you sh you should test it under a light conditions . # ME: I mean it's hard to tell I dunno . # ID: And also for people who are a bit colourblind . # PM: Colourblind . # PM: No so that's mostly red and green I believe . # ME: Which which colour should the buttons be ? # UI: That's adjustable . # PM: All all buttons ? # ME: Why adjustable ? # UI: That's how we are going to make it more trendy . # UI: Or is it too expensive ? # ME: But maybe I mean they have to they have to have some colour right ? # PM: It's difficult . # ME: And if the background is very dark blue # ID: But don't we wanna make the background the bright colo colours ? So th the total of the thing is very bright ? # ID: Like the pictures I showed you guys . # ID: Those things were all like bright red , bright red , flashy . # ME: So more like Doesn't work very well . # ME: More like this colour . # ID: something like that , something that stands out more . # ME: And then yellow and orange and red objects on it or something . # ME: But then again , which colour should the buttons be ? # ME: The the press buttons . Should they be white or black or # UI: And it looks quite cheap , that colour I think . # ME: but it's pretty fresh , on the other side . # ID: It's actually a pretty trendy colour at the moment . # UI: It's it's trendy okay . # ME: My couch is in that colour . # ME: Well it works pretty well . # ME: And then time was up . # ID: Do you get a pop-up if we # PM: within five minutes . # ME: That you have five minutes left or # PM: Y left and then I have to kick you out . # ME: So something like this . # ME: That should be pretty nice colour . # ME: But maybe the buttons , all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people . # ME: Because the of the green . # UI: But the but the buttons have their own LEDs or not ? # PM: They have LEDs but they have a colour . # ID: Red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate . Even for colourblind . # ID: They will see one of each as grey . # ID: But if you use green on blue , those kind of colours will look the same . # ME: So red buttons are okay ? # PM: You can make them red . # UI: That that's a default setting . The the red buttons . # PM: But I think you need to keep in mind that the LEDs are just extra light . # ME: How do you mean ? # PM: they don't determine the colour that much , I think . # UI: I was think about a red LEDs and blue LEDs and # PM: 'Cause you have to print on them you have a background # ME: No that's too busy I guess . # PM: Each number is transparent . # PM: partly but you have to print on the number . Or the sign . # PM: So you can't change the colour so # ME: You better bet better keep the LED and the button itself in the same colour I guess . # ME: So just an extra # ME: bit of light and attention . # PM: Bit of feedback . # ID: what we should do I think is make kind of a see-through plastic button , with one coloured LED behind it . # ID: So that the whole button will shine as the colour the And if you think about easy to use buttons , we have to , well we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold f for both hands , but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb , if you hold the machine . # PM: Okay with Don't mean to discourage you but basically you two are going to work on the smartboard . # PM: Next thirty minutes to design something so # PM: And the You will do the evaluation . # ME: Of the product ? # ME: Which we don't have yet . # ME: So wh how should I do that ? # PM: You probably get a mail . # ME: Or you or you send it to me . # PM: Once they are finished . # ME: because you are going to design it on this board right ? # PM: but maybe you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow . # ME: I probably get instruction on that , how to do that , so I make another presentation I guess . # ME: I kn I know what's gonna happen in so # PM: About . You have the basic idea . # ME: I've a basic idea . # PM: And you two are going to do this . # PM: Look-and-feel and # ID: So we're gonna work here ? On this sketchboard ? # ME: Alright so that's # PM: make new page and be creative . # UI: But we have to do it at this moment , after th this meeting ? # ID: Thirty minutes . # PM: thirty minutes . # PM: Then we have to see something which we can # PM: show to the management . # UI: so this is basically the what we are thinking about ? # ID: Shall we make a new # UI: l let's just delete all these or # ID: , I just make a new one . # PM: Oh and save this board . # ID: I'll just I'll just keep it there . # PM: but just press save and It'll be fine . # PM: You can also include clip-art . # PM: So if you'll rather draw in paint or something # ID: Current colour ? # ID: Shall we make some outline sketches of the basic shape first ? # UI: And then after that we can make the user inter interface . # ID: 'cause I have to focus on the on the basic look-and-feel design . # ID: So how it's gonna look . # ID: And you have to think how we're gonna put the screen in it and those kind of things . # ME: pretty accurate . # ID: So if I'm drawing and you think okay I'm not gonna be able to put a screen in there , you have to correct . # ME: Oh we skip this I guess . Sound button press . # ID: do you mind if I draw in black then ? For normal sketches . # PM: You can also include it . # PM: It's not much work . # UI: Oh no it's okay . # ME: Light only button user ca user interaction . # ID: so we kind of want the girlish # PM: That's included . # ME: the pl the plastic buttons also help because of they are only lit during interaction . So # ID: I'm not so good at drawing . # ME: Well it's a good thing that the buttons aren't , well that they are plastic , because then you can light up the light on when they are usable . # ME: Maybe you should draw it very large like this . # UI: but this part isn't functioning properly . # ID: How do we uh or insert text ? # PM: Maybe just start typing . # UI: It's a bit large . # ID: Oh that's a bit big . # PM: You also do the other sides . # PM: Not only on the front si the top side but also the side view . # UI: L let's make first the all the views . The the front view , side view and the back view . # ID: I thought for the side view , that the w the basic section would be rather a bit thicker than the middle , where you're holding it with your # PM: What do I write down ? # PM: Why can't I work here ? This is much easier . # ID: 'cause your fingers have to fit underneath and # UI: The middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand . # ME: I don't see a sign that the meeting is over yet but # ID: Exactly but the but the upper side has to be a bit more like that I think . # PM: so I just work here a few minutes . # ID: don't you think ? # UI: we can put a display . # ID: So the display we will put in here , the basic functions in here , where it's most reachable . # UI: The the arrow functions . # ID: Oh . This is hard . # ID: What do don't have to draw it exactly do we ? # ID: Let me try it one more time . # ID: Maybe I've it's easier if I draw it in once . # ID: Okay , of course it will become way more ugly . # UI: You can make it m larger . # UI: Maybe it's easier to draw # ID: This'll take forever . # ID: It's fun to work with this pen . # UI: that's the basic idea . # PM: Five minutes left before the meeting ends . # UI: only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit . # UI: That's the question . # ID: Let's fill i fill in the buttons later . # ID: So this is gonna be from the # ME: I is it if this is from the side # ME: Because there the screen goes up like that right ? # ME: So then it's like this , or that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the it's better to have it somewhat like this . # ME: Or does it flip all the way ? # ID: The the idea is that it has to flip up to here . # UI: May maybe it's easier to integrate the L_C_D_ screen just into this bubble . # UI: Because it do doesn't have to flip then . # UI: Because we have en enough space for making a an L_C_D . # UI: Because here # ME: It's better to have this like this I guess , and then flip it like this . # UI: But why do we need the flipping # ID: you can adjust the angle to which it flips . # ID: So it can also from this angle , it can flip all the way up to there . # ID: You can flip it up to there if you want . # ME: But we still keep the flipping mechanism . # PM: we keep the flip ? # PM: Keep the flip live . # ID: because I think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that I dunno . # UI: the shape is okay but I don't see the why we should use the flipping mechanism . # ID: I thought it would be cool . # UI: Because we Okay . It's it's for more trendy # ME: but maybe but maybe we should then # UI: Because we have enough space . # UI: H here we got the basic functions , the arrow button . # ME: there the middle Sh sh shouldn't we integrate it ? # UI: and then h we sh mm . # ME: And then like i oh th Come on . # ME: So this is the shape . # ID: It doesn't aim so well . # ME: Okay but the screen is a bit lower because if it falls on the other side , it doesn't fall on the screen . # ME: So there's a layer of rubber on the side . # ID: yeah . Definitely . # ME: So no flipping but just # UI: No flipping or # UI: you wanted the flipping so # ID: I guess but I mean most votes count right ? # UI: But if you if you If you drop it just breaks . # UI: And it has to be very strong because of the . kind of # ME: Throwing and the kinetics . # ME: Oh . We better make we better make it like this . Eventually . # PM: just light on top . # UI: And it's also for the for the children , it's for people not sixteen years . # ID: if you if you're going for the kinetics # PM: Mm . okay that the target group . # UI: But there are more # ME: they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone , so also to deal with their remote control . Yes . # UI: okay . That's true . # PM: Well . I just ended the meeting . # ID: I'm just thinking totally different designs also . # PM: You two go design . # ID: Remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a Gameboy . # ID: Maybe we should try something like that . But . # PM: I thought up a name for our product . # PM: It's called the Real Remote . # PM: With a copyright sign after Real . # UI: The Real Remote . # PM: So maybe you can include that somewhere . # ID: Okay . This can go . # ME: We should work in our own room right ? Or not ? # ID: Oh we have to f include that in our design as well . # PM: I don't see any power cables here so # ID: What the hell's that ? # UI: I think it's the sensors . # ME: See you two in half an hour # UI: Okay that's the side . # UI: But do we want options on the on the side with the with the buttons ? # UI: Or just leave it ? # UI: could make an a volume button scroll , volume button . # ID: or j or also scrolling for the m . # ID: We w kind of wanted to stick with the I'm just thinking , if we i we wanna make something different So the with the scroll is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons . # UI: you are going to design it so .
# PM: Okay . first of all I'll start with the costs , because that's going to influence our design . # PM: Don't know if you al already had a look or not ? # UI: No n I already did it . # ID: Did you do your questionnaire already ? # UI: It's just one question . # PM: Because we have a problem . # PM: If you look closely , you can see . # PM: I already took the liberty to make some suggestions . # PM: At the moment we have fifteen buttons , one L_C_D_ screen , one advanced chip-on-print . # PM: We use a sensor , that's for the speech . # PM: we use kinetic energy . # PM: And we wanted the buttons in a special colour . # PM: Okay . What's the first thing we should drop ? # PM: The special colour of the buttons ? # UI: No that's for the trendy feel and look . So # ID: but everything is . # PM: Should we switch to a hand dynamo ? # PM: that's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things . # ME: but young people like that . # ME: So just do normal battery . # UI: I think the battery option . # ID: Just a normal battery then , . # ME: It has to be twelve and a half . # ID: Oh my goodness . # PM: You're going to redesign something . # PM: Okay , so we're at twenty five . # PM: Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved ? # ID: Well I guess i we'll have to go for single curve then . # ID: I mean we have to drop on everything . # ME: But we can keep it single curved with top view still curved , but from the side it's flat , and the screen is just Well you just have to hold it like this then . So # PM: another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine , so you can't directly access a channel , but instead use only the up and down arrows . # PM: That would skip nine buttons and four and a half Euros . # ID: That's what I was thinking . # ME: Let's do it then . # PM: then we have left # UI: But we don't have any basic options any more . # ID: And 'cause then they don't have to n They don't need special colour as well . # PM: They don't need special colours . # PM: Fine . That's more like it . # PM: You were saying something . # ID: That was exactly my point . Like let's drop all the buttons , and just make one I mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway . So we'll just have to use it for everything . # ID: And then you can make an overview of channels in the screen , and select a channel , click # PM: , some more menu options . # PM: Okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons . # PM: Now let's look . # UI: we c could We only need the menu arrow button thing . # UI: Everything you can do with the menu . So With the display . # ID: we need one integrated button for everything then . # ME: The joystick . # ID: I was Because # PM: , scroll-wheel , push-button # ID: If you if you go to # ME: Integrated scroll-wheel push-button , . # ID: If you go to our view , like you if you are in the sound system there , and you wanna adjust the treble for instance , this is just an example , y you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example . # ID: But you want a sound preview of how it's gonna sound , So you wanna click on it , activate it , whe and when you move it , hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound . # ID: So you'll need a kind of a joystick button . # ME: or the integrated scroll-wheel push-button . # ME: So that's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it , adjust it , click again and then you're out of it . # ME: But you still But you then still need to have Well you can use the scroll-wheel as well for maybe for the channels . # ME: But you still You still have to have some button in the menu to go back . # UI: So you do one inte You can do one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . # UI: And then just drop all the other buttons . # UI: But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons . # ME: Not s not sound I guess . # PM: One integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button . # UI: So we have to make it s more It has to be # PM: You could also drop j three more of these , without losing much functionality . # PM: You just drop the Okay and the Back . # ME: Wh wh what is the what is the sample sensor sample speaker ? # PM: Oh , that's for the speech . # ME: Speech recognition . # UI: Could drop the speech recognition . # PM: S s Drop speech recognition ? # PM: that's possible . # ID: it's expensive , but we never considered the possibilities of speech recognition . # ID: 'Cause it can take the function of a lot of uh buttons . # PM: That's not very easy to use . # ME: No , it can be disturbed by noise and # ID: but lets just say that the speech recognition works . # ME: stuff like that . # ME: Let let me see what's more what's more popular . # ME: I guess the screen was more popular than the speech recognition . # ME: I have to look on that . Let me see . # ME: well no I was wrong . # ME: There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen . # PM: Because if you d lose the L_C_D_ screen , we need a lot of # ME: But if it But it it's a it's a both a hypers # UI: We lose our whole concept . # PM: We need a lot of extra buttons . # UI: We keep the L_C_D_ . # ME: Well we keep the screen . # ME: I mean it's about the same . Eight one to ninety one percent , sixty six to seventy six . # ID: We we haven't really integrated this the speech into the system , # PM: so we drop the speech . # ID: so we can might as well s drop that . # ME: Let's drop the speech . # PM: S Fo Four less Euros . # PM: So we still have three and a half Euro to lose . # ME: Sixteen Euros . # ID: We need to lose some buttons . # PM: if you lose the Back , the Okay button v let's say we only have the four arrows , and the Menu button . # ME: And then and then use # PM: Oh and the power button we have also . # ME: The the And the menu button does also does the okay function then . # ME: And then when you in the menu # PM: So that's one Euro . # ME: S so you activate the menu . # UI: If we do two integrated scroll-wheel push-buttons , we can drop all the push-buttons . # UI: With with one integrated button we can do the whole menu thing . # UI: With the other , we can do the channel , the volume , et cetera . # PM: That would save zero point two Euros compared to # UI: No it's three Euros . # PM: To This together is more expensive than Oof , it's almost the same as t keeping this . # PM: And we can drop these two . # ME: For example if you have f four buttons , channel up and down , volume left right # ME: Okay , I've I think we have to keep that . # PM: And the power button . # ME: And then and the power button . So that's five . # PM: That's the basic . # ME: That's basic . That that's what you need anyway . # ME: And then for the menu , you can have a button that activates menu . # ME: Or d or do we just integrate an scroll-wheel with a push-button . # ME: And then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel , the menu gets activated , and then you can scroll , choose an option , click on it , it goes into an feature . # ME: Click on it again , selects features , scroll , adjust it . # ME: Click again , it's okay . # ME: Then you only need one button to move back . # ME: Or or under each option , you set a you set an a screen thing what says back , and you select that one , click again , and you go one step back . # ME: And in that menu , scroll , click , one step back . # ME: So that then you need five buttons , and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . # PM: Okay th that's # ME: But we can't drop three buttons . # ID: Which That's even # ME: But I see that's # PM: that's one Euro more expensive . # ME: So that's not a good idea . # PM: That's not an option . # ME: Because which buttons do we have now ? # ME: Those five which I mentioned , and then menu , and then # ME: F of the four things ? # ID: , if you if you go to eight # ID: I don't know how to # PM: So four arrows ? # PM: power I believe ? # ME: Th that's five . # PM: We have a Back and a Okay button . # ME: okay that's seven , # ME: and one to activate the menu , . # ME: So okay that's eight . # ME: Well we can't reduce that . # ME: We we keep the display . # PM: , and even if we drop three buttons from here , we still have to make some adjustments around here . So # ID: we need the chip for the for the L_C_ display . # UI: Let's make the Let's make the case plastic . # ME: well we need the advanced # PM: Then I rather make it wood . # PM: Because then also it's good in the market with the forty five plus people . # ME: but that's not our market . # PM: No that maybe not . But maybe it's better than plastic anyway . # ME: no , hard plastic . # UI: Plastic with a with a special colour . # UI: A woo wood colour . # ME: , plastic with special colour . # UI: That's an option . # ME: Because we have to use the special colour anyway . # ME: You forgot that . # ME: So let's go for the plastic . # PM: , okay . Plastic . # ME: And since it's not kinetic , it doesn't have to flip around that much ? # PM: that's easy because plastic is free . # ME: We still have problem of two Euros . # PM: if we dropped # UI: No the buttons , those are really needed . # ME: we can't drop them . # UI: An advanced chip-on-print . # PM: You still need that . # ME: Do we really need that advanced chip for an L_C_D_ display ? # ID: So the other option would be to go for the sample speaker , and Which can use a regular chip , wh which is six Euros in total . # ID: That doesn't matter . # ME: Oh . I rather keep I rather keep the display . # PM: No , I keep the re . Because we already designed for it . So # ME: So the only option is an hand dynamo . # PM: and something else . # ME: Oh no tha Oh that's one Euro , right . # ID: can't we f fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push-button ? 'Cause that will save us one and a half Euro already . # ME: And then integrated s but that would make it not so easy to use . # PM: No y you would rec # ME: I mean it's not that important , easy to use , but # PM: Then you have # ID: Th then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want , huh ? # PM: Then you still need two additional buttons I believe . # PM: For the volume . # ID: d at l . At least one for power . # PM: You can use those . # PM: That's three buttons and this would cost # ID: it's just as expensive as what we have now . # UI: But the integrated button ? How many func functions can it have ? # PM: Three . Up , down , Okay . # ID: I mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on . # ID: You can go into you in you main menu , # ME: You you press it for like three seconds . # ID: you can choose flip channel , you can choose sound options , any options . # ME: Then then you should do everything in the menu . On the screen . # PM: , okay . It would save enough # ID: Maybe we should . # ID: 'Cause we don't have money and w we want the screen . # PM: you can choose this , drop these , then we have a half Euro left . # PM: So we can maybe still use power button . # ME: , but we'd Alright . # ID: I guess we have to . # ME: It s it saves us four Euros and it costs us two and a half . # ME: So let's see , we drop the price by one and a half . # ID: We'll we'll be on # ME: But we still have thirteen left . # PM: Oh then I miscalculated . Oh . # ME: Thirteen . So still half . # PM: Drop the special colour . # ME: There goes the special co Well That would make it less appealing . So that's no option . # UI: No no , it has to be curved . # ME: We sure about the advanced chip we need for the display ? # ID: it says right here . # PM: They made it very easy for us . # ME: We made it hard for ourselves with the display , but it's a cool feature . # PM: , I don't think I can s persuade the management to say , this is better for the market so you sell more than # UI: Wh what we could do is drop the special colour , and do the special colour for the buttons . # PM: Oh since we only have one button . # ME: but I mean what is meant by special colour ? # PM: I just m I don't I think # UI: Just something else than black or white I think . # PM: it's I think it's grey , regular . # PM: Grey and rubber . # ID: But we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though . # ME: So I rather have an hand dynamo than drop the colour . # ME: You can still play with it then I guess . # ME: , but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working . So I guess that isn't an option . # ID: Well , you only have to power it up when you wanna use it . # UI: But if you have to power the for ten minutes , then the # PM: No I don't think the current status of chips are pretty energy conserving , no . # ME: Let's let's go for the hand dynamo then . # PM: Do you want an extra button ? # ME: Or or do we Or do we do uncurved and flat ? Instead of # UI: No no it has to be curved . # ME: it has to be curved and has to have that colour . # UI: Just put a special colour of the buttons , or something . # ID: . That's the most import # PM: Instead of an additional power button ? # UI: or spe special form ? # ME: S what is special f Oh , special form . # ME: Maybe that's nicer . # PM: It's for scroll Without # ME: But we don't have any buttons . # UI: . But it's for the integrated button , I think also . Or # ME: d make it a special colour then . # ME: ma make it a special colour then . # PM: but it's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down . So # ME: Okay . Make it a special colour and then it look fancy . # PM: Woah we're within budget . # PM: It's a miracle . # ME: Let's let's save it . # UI: oh ma make it two special colours , but we only have one button . # ME: Let's do it like this , I mean , because it does not lose our identity of the product as we # PM: 'Kay , this was old . # ID: Well we come back to the drawing board then , huh ? # ME: all your designs are pretty much # PM: back to work Did I save it ? # ID: It's silly 'cause we should have had this meeting before we start drawing . # ME: but that but that's the fun part of it . # PM: I wanted to go , but I wasn't allowed . So # PM: I just forgot to save this . # PM: Just a minute . # ME: what's the next phase ? # PM: , this the last phase of course , so # ME: By your humble P_M_ . # ME: Oh f Frustrated . Alright . # PM: Well we first should have had a prototype presentation . # PM: But well as you saw that hadn't made no sense , because we had to drop it . # ID: Drop everything . # ID: We went straight into finance ? # PM: it was more important , so I just pushed up the agenda . # PM: evaluation criteria . # PM: You have t produced something about that ? # ME: that that's . I sure did . # ME: And it combines with product evaluation . # PM: you put it in the . # ME: We all have to keep in mind what has changed now . # ME: So what we have left on the Because evaluation is based on the initial user requirements . # ME: Let's make it big . # ME: Well we evaluate the design with a seven point scale , as following . # ME: Well the remote controls according criteria blah . # ME: True or false , and then on a scale of seven points , a scale , as we all know it . # ME: Well the criteria are based on the user requirements , the trends from the marketing research , and the marketing strategy of the company itself . # ME: well they are in a Word document , which I will open now . # ME: I don't know it's open yet . # ME: And we all have to agree on a certain level . # ME: Oh . I don't know . # ME: Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user . # ME: So that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions . # ME: How do you think about that ? # ID: I think it does . # ID: Because the operating behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of L_C_D_ , # PM: , of course we dropped a little bit of those # ME: the us u it's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions , in this question . # ME: So do you think # ID: Well , we have extended menus , on the on the L_C_D_ screen . So # ME: You can you can ma , you can make a lot of extended menus . That's true . # ME: I mean the possibilities are almost unlimited , to build in menus in the screen . # ME: So on a scale from one to seven , what do you think ? # ME: Two or three ? Something like that ? # ME: Well we have to choose one . # ME: So what do you say ? # PM: y we should fill this in now . # ME: I agree on two . # ME: I say two , personally . But # PM: in the new design I s would say it's three . But now , in original design I say two . # ME: well we have to evaluate I guess what we have now . # PM: Okay then I say three . # ME: You say three , and you said al also three ? # ME: Okay well I say still two , but it has to be three then . # PM: Hey , you're marketing , eh . # ME: So it's made bold . But it's nah , it's not very clear on the sc # PM: M maybe underline . # UI: Or give it a colour . # ME: Maybe other colour , . # ME: That's better . # ME: Oh , it doesn't have to be bold anymore . # ME: well the remote control has Wha # PM: He types everything . # ID: Definitely one . It has to be . # ME: The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions . # ME: For example audio settings and screen settings . # UI: It hides basic functions . # PM: Everything . You don't use anything else . # ME: Well , . So it it's a very true point . I mean it hides all those function . # ID: You're not gonna find them . # ME: But , I mean they're hidden in the screen . # ME: If you don't want to use them , you don't s you s just scroll over them . # ME: And you place them F I don't know where . # ME: So that's very true , I guess , for our case . # ID: the next Not so much so . # ME: the second point . # ME: It shows the relevant and most used functions . # ME: Power button . # ME: Do we ha still have a power button ? # PM: check with the Excel sheet . # ME: Well the button's integrated , huh ? # UI: I think we are # ID: it's integrated . # ME: we dropped it . # ME: You j you just push it in for # UI: Oh it was integrateds . # PM: integrate it . # ME: just push it in for th for three seconds or something , and then # ID: E exactly just like a m mobile . # PM: Just go scrolling and it will activate . # ME: it shows the relevant and most used functions . # ME: on the other on one side I would say yes , and the other side I would say no . # ME: So it's I don't know . # PM: It shows the most used functions and they are relevant , but # UI: Can you change channels directly with just one button ? # UI: No , you have to scroll through the menu , before # ME: With the scroll butt and then say channel . # ID: Well we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something , if When it's on , it's turned on , # PM: You say you double click on the # ID: It automatically has the programme and the volume function , but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some Or you double click it . # ME: But but how do you change from volume to channel ? # ID: No because it has four arrows , # PM: No , not anymore . # PM: Because he's now have a scroll-wheel that you can push in . # PM: Like on the mouse . # ID: I was thinking still about our integrated joystick . # ME: No we have n we have no buttons left . So the joystick was not an option . # ID: that is a bummer . # ME: So so you hav So you have to double-click , I mean , for , I mean , volume , # PM: To get into menu . # ME: and three double click for the menu , or something . # PM: Or hold it ten seconds . # ID: We'll make it a Morse code . # ME: But but ease of use was not very important , may I remind you . # PM: No no . it should be trendy . # ME: So that's but that that's not a question . # ME: the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions . # ME: Well I think it's pretty much in the middle . # ME: You have to search for them in the in the s in the screen , in the menu . So # PM: , im in the menu . # ME: So maybe it's more like a f a five . Or # ID: I would go for five or six , . # ME: Five ? Alright . # ID: Let's not diss our remote . # PM: It's the weirdest remote control I've ever seen . So # ID: Just one button . # PM: Well it's different . # ME: the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . # ME: Well but we dropped the speech recognition . But it has at least one innovation . # PM: , it's still , I say two . # ID: We still have the fruit and vegetable print . # ME: I say two then . # PM: Oh , that's the next . # ME: but that that's not that's not this question . thi that's the other question . # ID: Fr Oh I mean the Oh never mind . # UI: I think a two . No . # ME: I think L_C_D_'s more useful than speech # ME: Oh not the bold one . # ID: It's way more practical , . # ME: Okay , it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints , primary colours and sponge-like material . # ME: It should have been two questions . I realise now , because sponge-like material is dropped . # ME: But the look and feel # PM: You still have rubber d Or no . # ID: So we still we still have the primary colours . But only on the on the outside , not on the button . # UI: No you got a plastic . # ME: The button has also colour . # PM: The one button we have . # ID: still we dropped also on the double curve . # PM: you could check with the Excel sheet . # UI: You only have one . # ME: we have single curve now , # ID: And and colour . # ME: and no and no material . So maybe in the middle or something . # PM: We have something . # ID: Actually we d we didn't do so well on this one . # ID: Because it's basically an old one , with little curve on the side , and in a different colour . # ID: Still , it's still hard . # ID: I mean the sponge-like and the three D_ shape , that would give it something young and fresh . # ME: But then we would have to drop the screen . # PM: You like both . # ME: the remote control displays the corporate logo . # PM: I just couldn't # ME: You just have to draw it . # PM: , just one minute . # UI: It's the white part # ID: be because we couldn't hardly draw on the b s on the lower half of the screen , we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the # UI: We have a we have a # ID: So I mean I wanted to put digits on the buttons as well . But # ME: But there's enough space for the corporate logo . I mean , if there's only one thing . # ID: Hell . If we have only one button . # ME: So I will say that is very true . # ID: And even the shape we have now simulates kind of an R_ and the reversed R_ , doesn't it ? # ME: The remote control is easy to use . # ME: Well I would say Skill , I would say six , or something . I don't think it's easy to use , or not so . # ID: The only e the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers . 'Cause it has only one button . # UI: And that you only have to control one button . # ME: It it has a nice screen . # UI: It gives visual feedback . So # ME: Well I would say a five or a six . # UI: I think a five . Five . # ID: I would say six . # ME: What do you say ? Easy to use ? Five or a six ? # ID: It's really not easy to use . # PM: No not anymore . # ID: 'Cause you're putting everything # ME: , I would go for the six too . So # ID: Most votes count . # ME: well , another question , # UI: that looks great . # ME: the remote control is durable . # ME: I don't know if that's the correct word . # ID: Definitely in casing , 'cause we have a hard plastic # ME: In use , both battery as casing ? # ID: because the batteries , those thingies last forever . # ID: And the casing , hard plastic also lasts forever . # ME: And the casing is plastic , ? # ME: If you don't drop it too much , it's should last pretty long . # ID: So I would go for one . # ME: But I think rubber compared is better . So I think a two is more appropriate Okay I will go for two . # ME: The remote control's a good example for company's motto , we put the fashion in electronics . # UI: No we put the electronics into the fashion . # ME: turn around . But # ID: I would go for four . # ID: Because we kind of tried to but we kind of failed with the budget that we have . # ME: It's not So a four . # ME: It's it g it g goes , it's not the best we could do , I guess . # ME: But it all has to do with the budget , because it's not the bad idea we had , so # ME: So if I understood it right , we have to count these numbers . # ME: Word document , the we have to count them . # ME: just add them and then divide them . # PM: Could somebody start calculator ? # ID: we can do the math . # ME: I all made it po I all made it I all made it possible for a positive questions , so we can count it . # ME: I mean if you have reversed question , you have to reverse the scale , # PM: , . You have to So four and # ID: Did you make this questionnaire or what ? # ID: I wouldn't be able to do it that fast . # ME: Question number four , ? # UI: Oh . Wait a second . Oh . # UI: It's it's gone wrong . # ME: How hard is it ? # UI: Okay . It's your turn . # ID: Pretty difficult . # UI: No it's if you press twice on the plus button , then you get s # ME: Oh there tho there's no n There's no num pads . # UI: No . That's why it's # ME: It's a it's a bit # ID: Just type in the digits . # ID: They're all one digit numbers right ? # ID: And then you can count them together . # ME: I think you can just count them by a # UI: Just count it to . # ME: let's move over . # PM: Okay . Three , four , nine . # ME: Three , plus one , four . Nine . # ME: sixteen plus six . # ID: How hard is this ? # UI: Twenty four . Twenty six . # ID: Twenty four . Twenty eight . # ME: Twenty eight . # PM: That was the last one . That was that . # ID: Twenty eight . # UI: Okay . Twenty eight . # PM: So divided by nine . # ME: That's three Or le less than a three . # ID: the lower the The lower the score the better , right ? # ME: Twenty eight # PM: Divided by nine . # ME: di divided by nine # ME: makes three point one . # PM: So we're better than average . # ID: I Are you sure we this number actually tells us somethings ? # ID: I don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative . # UI: Some questions are . # ID: So if you give a true to a positive , it actually means that the low the lower the better . # ID: But if you give true to a negative question # ME: , but there are no negative questions I guess . # ME: Good example . Durable use . # ID: Durable , that's good . # ME: Easy to use . This is good . # ME: Fancy look and feel , that's good . # ME: Technology innovation was good , because of a marketing requirement . # ME: Re relevant most used function . # ID: I guess you did do it . # ME: And hides these functions . That was also a good thing . # ME: And then matches the opera of the user was also a good thing . # ME: So it were all positive questions , by purpose . So Yes , so the It tells us something , yes . # ME: Becau But the picture would be a lot different if we didn't have to drop those things , I guess . # ID: Because now it's just an average It's remote . # ME: Nah it it's better than average , but # ID: okay because of the L_C_D_ screen . # ID: But it looks and stuff , it still # PM: Has some shortcomings . # ID: it's not , it's not really eye-catching , except for the colour . # ME: The colour and the screen . # PM: Okay so this we had , this we had . # PM: We have to do a product evaluation . # ID: Product evaluation . # PM: prototype presentation we dropped . # PM: So the finance we looked . # PM: We have redesigned . # PM: not on that , but # ME: we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this # PM: So you can just make one big L_C_D_ screen . # UI: Okay it's your turn now . # ME: With some casing around it , . # ID: Okay we're still gonna go for the fancy colours ? # ID: But are we gonna stick with the green or are we gonna do blue ? # UI: we can just use this one . And then over-paint it with uh the green # PM: The the button has a special colour , the frame has a special colour . # UI: he only needs one button . # ID: One scroll button and # PM: It's plastic . And single curved . # UI: Or we have to delete this one or # PM: Oh and you might want to add a infrared LED . # PM: Otherwise it doesn't function so well . # ME: Do we have to do other things ? # PM: Well I have to um make an report of every decision we made so far . # ME: Or just redesign ? # PM: And I try to get chip just before I receive the Excel sheet . # ME: So you made a start , right ? # PM: I'm somewhere , but maybe you can help me . # ID: Should give it some time ? # UI: Okay , but how do we make the scroll button ? # ID: Have to take this away also . # UI: that's the infrared thing . # ME: The the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables , like primary colours , spongy shape . # ID: Current colour red . # ME: The playfulness , we decided to use kinetic energy as a power sour # ID: Oh we did our special colour for the Line widths , now that's a ten . # ME: That's conceptual , yes . # PM: That's enough to get started with , so # UI: . , it's just a scroll # ID: It's gonna be one str scroll . # UI: , is it's horizontal or vertical ? # ME: How many pages ? # PM: , I just took one for every step and then a conclusion . # ME: Y you have you have done the first two . # ID: Horizontal's easier too , 'cause you can # ME: and the look and feel is # ID: Is it more natural than this ? # PM: Well I think I have to make a p an issue called finance . # ID: So let's say Whoops . 'Kay . # UI: It doesn't look like # ME: The items we had to drop . # UI: It's not very fashionable anymore . But it's okay . # ID: It's really ugly . # ME: Where did we start with price ? # UI: Maybe m make it bigger ? Or # ME: Twenty six and a half . # ME: Or twenty six ? # ME: Something like that . # UI: That looks little bit more Maybe that's a s a special colour for it . So we can make it special ? # ID: What do you mean ? # ID: Like a other colour than this one ? # UI: Or or speckles in it ? # ID: can we do it can we do a print ? # PM: I don't think so , if you see the options . But # ID: I think we have to choose , ? # ID: Okay special colour . We do have special colour . # UI: red is already a special colour , I think . So # ID: Does it mean that # UI: It's not very special , but # ID: Shall we just give it some dots to make it look pretty ? # UI: Just put the purple on it . # ME: Some some big dots . # UI: That's trendy . # ID: Oh no my remote has acne . # ME: We have the original balance sheet , or # ID: No . That's why we have that button . # ID: How the We did we do that ? # UI: Oh it's just one computer ? Or # ME: Just dual screen . # UI: But can we delete it , just with delete ? Or # ID: That doesn't respond also to the undo . # ID: It looks like it's # ID: Where do you want some more dots ? # PM: You can't even draw anymore . # PM: Even children can draw . # ME: you push the button or something . # PM: Can you just push pen and then keep on # UI: Oh that's the select button . # ID: Okay , it's not the prettiest , I know . # ID: It's not so random huh ? # ME: Lot of options . # UI: Specially the R_ . # ME: , the R_ and another R_ . # ME: It's called the Real Remote , right ? # ME: Maybe maybe it c it can say that . The Real Remote . # PM: just on the m the L_C_D_ display . # PM: This is your Real Remote . # ID: We can make a l a logo . # ID: Like put it like the shape . # UI: D designed by # ID: Something like that . # ID: I mean it's not too That's not their logo , is it ? # UI: Do they have a lo Oh , the here . # UI: This i this is the logo . # UI: Two R_s and a one # PM: You can just reuse that , because the name is the same . Initials . # ME: You can copy and paste the picture if you want . # ID: Shall we do the logo in black or not ? # ME: What is that ? Look more Looks more like a campfire . # ID: Are you dissing my drawing ? # ID: It looks like a ribbon . # ID: So who wants to draw ? # ID: This is actually quite fun . # ID: Do we need to do anything ? # UI: Are we ready ? Or # ID: I hear you people are typing . # ME: Type in your report . # ME: I don't see any new messages . So # UI: Is this the last assignment ? Or # ID: It's almost four . # ME: What time do we have to deliver the report ? Four o'clock or # ME: Or before that ? # PM: Okay . And copy this . # ME: Just compare # PM: Just a minute . # ID: This is really bizarre . # ID: It looks like there's a It looks like a butterfly . # PM: It's somewhere I d It isn't inside . # UI: No it's in inside the # PM: , and don't know how it's or eject it . # ME: No it's on the on the beamer I guess . # PM: From up there ? # ID: No , but it i It's not a bu a beamer . # ID: B It's a normal T_V_ screen , kind of thing . # PM: it's somewhere in here . # UI: Hey , you've got it read only . # UI: So you have to # ME: This something what's projection from behind , I guess . # ID: there is some kind of projection I think . # ME: it it's a beamer , but then with a # ID: With a with a mirror , huh ? Or something . # ME: within a mirror , . # ME: So it looks like a big screen , but in fact it isn't . # ID: So are we gonna change anything to this ? # ID: I mean is it gonna # ME: Well it's single curved . # UI: It's now single curved . So It's flat . Oh no . # ID: This is gonna be flat . exactly . # ME: Th this is flat . # UI: Okay . It doesn't matter . # ME: But it's better to have in the front , this kind of shape , because it looks nice . # ME: I mean you see more of this than of that . # ME: , more like that . # ID: And this is also gonna be # ME: It's not very ideal . # ID: But sometimes then all of a sudden it does work . # UI: That's the detector for the # ME: But I don't see a detector over there . # ID: I think you only need two points . # ME: I thought it was a kind of thing to put it on , and then draw right lines or something . # UI: Maybe that's why it's not working , because it's more # ME: Or just messed it up . # ID: it matters for the aim of this thing . # ME: but it wasn't good . # UI: You've to make it s ninety degrees . # ME: it has to touch the corners , I guess . # ME: But th this one wasn't good , because if I was drawing here , I drew a line and then it came over here . # PM: now you probably have to recalibrate . # PM: Oh , five minutes to the end of the meeting . # UI: Oh we're always long . # PM: And the recalibration is done using this icon here . # UI: can we t can we get to that @ i Oh it's not working anymore . # ME: , it's okay . It's working again . # UI: Oh yeah , it's working , it's working . # ME: It's better than before . # UI: We're improving . # ME: that's improved pretty much . # ID: it's only a bit like to that side , but that is that one by the way . # ME: but it's better , it's better # ID: 'Cause this one makes the angle either like this . # ID: So i if I change this , it will go there , if I change that , will go there . # ME: No . It's better than it was I guess . # ID: I will take this away 'cause it looks messy . # ME: Works pretty well . # ME: Five minutes before the meeting's over . # PM: Then I have to uh write this , # ME: We have to present # PM: and I don't know if you have to present , because I didn't receive any information about that so far . # ID: Maybe we will . # PM: Maybe we get a final mail . # ME: So it after the after these five minutes , you have to # PM: , I have still ten minutes to finish the report . # ID: What's this anyway ? # ME: After after that five minutes , you have ten minutes to finish it , or # ID: It looks like candle wax . # PM: And you can just relax and have cup of coffee or # PM: oh no , they don't have beer here so you can't celebrate . # PM: You can just if you ma finish my presentation please . # PM: The presentation is still open . # PM: So if you finish that then you'll see # PM: Oh , we have to do the project evaluation . # PM: Just do that quickly . # ME: How do you do it ? # PM: well basically what that says , we discuss it and # PM: So how were did the project process go ? # PM: Did you , were you all pleased with the process as it was ? # ID: th do you mean the interaction between us ? Or # PM: the interaction and the steps we followed , and so forth . # ID: well at first I was really stressed . Because it went a bit fast . # ID: But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on , the second time I think I did a bit better . # ID: And the third time , I mean # ME: And we move more to working together as team , because at first you make your individual contribution , and then come here , and you have no idea what the others have to make . # ME: And then finally you have some idea , okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that , and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own . So The process , I mean , the interaction between us became better and better I guess . # UI: Especially after the first meeting . # ME: , especially if f if you see you se you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting I guess . # PM: Okay and was that due to my leadership ? # ID: Well you did become more assertive the second time round , so that . You were more in charge kind of thing . # PM: was there enough room for creativity ? # UI: but only the financial parts # ME: Li Limiteded afterwards , but If if you don't take that into account , there's plenty of room for creativ creativity . # ME: Also not only the drawing and the making of the thing itself , but also in explaining it to the other people , by means of # ID: We were pretty democratic . # ME: the board and PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that . # PM: So and the about the board digital pen ? # PM: was that helpful or # ME: Mm I think in essence the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard . # ME: Because it just works better . # ME: I mean uh I've made , I've made several notes just to test it , and just put the pen in into it , and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly . # ME: So it it's better a better device than the screen . # ME: But the screen is useful , in essence , but it doesn't work that well . # ID: It's it's The the pen is more intuitive , 'cause we're all used to writing with pen . # ID: And as I said , I have no idea how PowerPoint works , so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation . # ID: But once I get to know the program probably , I mean , it looks better , you know . # ID: Or something like that . # ID: You can give it a kind of a home style , like we have i the logo and everything . # ID: And I don't know . # ME: Warning . Finish meeting now . # UI: Finish meeting . # PM: Okay , are there any new ideas about this ? # PM: I didn't really receive , . # ME: It's use especially useful , I guess , to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff . # ME: the screen and stuff like that . # UI: I think the PowerPoint is too limited . # UI: You can't draw easy in PowerPoint . # UI: The drawing board has to be integrated into PowerPoint , so that you can just easily # ID: the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well . # ID: You know , you can draw something on the sketch-board and then take it there , or whatever . # ME: .
