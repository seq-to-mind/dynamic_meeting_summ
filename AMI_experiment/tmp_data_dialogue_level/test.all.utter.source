# PM: we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that a bit better ? # PM: Okay , that's fine . # PM: Am I supposed to be standing up there ? # ME: So we've got both of these clipped on ? # ME: She gonna answer me or not ? # ME: Right , both of them , okay . # ME: Jesus , it's gonna fall off . # PM: Hello everybody . # UI: Hi , good morning . # PM: I'm Sarah , the Project Manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough . # PM: Okay , this is our agenda , we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . # PM: then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as I can understand . # PM: Now , we're developing a remote control which you probably already know . # PM: , we want it to be original , something that's people haven't thought of , that's not out in the shops , trendy , appealing to a wide market , but you know , not a hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it . # PM: Okay , first is the functional design , this is where we all go off and do our individual work , what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that . # PM: , conceptual design , what we're thinking , how it's gonna go and then the detailed design , how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work . # PM: We're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , I'll go first , and sum up the characteristics of that animal . # PM: Okay , I'll leave space for everyone else . # PM: What's missing ? # PM: We're running out of blue . # PM: I'm not gonna ask you to guess , I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger . # PM: And I see them as majestic , and independent , and proud . # PM: Now , who would like to go next ? # UI: Where did this come from ? # PM: Is that your lapel then ? # UI: , maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make ? # UI: It's actually sitting , so # ID: It's sitting down . # UI: it's sitting , it's not standing . # UI: Okay , I see it as one thing it's very supportive . # UI: It's your best friend and your you can talk to a dog , it can be your best friend , it doesn't discriminate between you , based on what you are . # UI: Second it's loyal and third thing it's got intuition . # UI: dogs can som sometimes can make out between a thief and a person so basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog . # PM: Okay , thank you . # ME: Please , please leave me a space at the bottom , I'm little , # ID: Alright , okay . # ME: you can get to the top , with standing on a chair . # ID: Well since you guys have chosen the ones I wanted to do , I'll have to have to go for something a bit random . # UI: Does it look like a dog actually ? # ID: And also , my drawing skill isn't that great so , . # PM: Well , as you can see , the quality of the work today is # ME: I think it's outstandingly good . # ID: Okay , now I'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be because that looks like a beak now , so . # ID: , it can be a crocodile , it can be a crocodile . # PM: Gonna be a bird . # PM: Is it gonna be # ID: Well it was it was an at first # PM: it's gonna be a bird . # ID: firstly it was an attempt at a T_ Rex and then it sort of changed into a pelican but it can be a crocodile now actually . # PM: That's lovely . # ID: and I'll have to think on the spot of things that it is . # ME: Beauti that's # ID: strong , that's about it I think . # PM: Okay it's fine . # ME: , I'm very impressed with your artistic skills , mine's are dreadful . # ME: Oops this is now coming apart , let me just put the top in . # ME: I hope that clicks in , I'll just I'll hold it on , okay . # ME: Oops , oh dear , what happened there ? # PM: Technical help . # ME: Hopefully that'll stay on , two-handed version . # ME: Again this is off the top of my head , I was gonna do a big cat too , . # ME: Oh dear , it doesn't look what like what I want it to be . # ME: It's not a vampire bat honestly . # ME: and somewhere there's a body behind . # ID: Okay , some sort of bird # ME: That's my dreadful that's the worst yet , it's meant to be an eagle # ID: eagle , right okay . # PM: not a seagull . # ME: you can tell it's a flying animal could have been a seagull , I never thought of a seagull . # ME: An eagle , again I'm thinking on my feet goodness . # ME: I suppose they're all so independent , I'd put that one down again . # ID: They're good at golf . # ME: Indepen independent , right , did you say they're good at golf ? # ME: Oh . Oh right , okay , I'm not good at golf . # ME: I'd say they're quite free-spirited , flying around everywhere , doing their own thing . # ME: And , birds of prey aren't they , oh dear , intrepid . I'll put that , intrepid . # PM: That's lovely . # ME: hope that pen's gonna be okay . # PM: That was fun , finance-wise , we've got a selling price at twenty five Euros , which I don't actually know what that is in Pounds , at all . # UI: One point four or something like that . # UI: One point four Euro would make a Pound or something like that . # ID: , something like that , so that # ID: about seventeen , seventeen Pounds , something like that . # ME: Seventeen Pounds . # PM: Okay , that's expensive . # ME: Should we be making notes of this ? # ME: We can just refer to this later can't we ? # PM: I think so , I think so , I'll be able to pull it up , or I could put it in the shared folder or something . # ID: Havi having said that though , if you wanna get one of those the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway . # ID: So , it'd still be # ID: we had to buy one . # ME: so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option ? # PM: production cost's at twelve fifty , so # UI: pretty huge margin . # PM: half of the selling price is taken up by building it . # PM: , and profit aim is fifty million Euros , which is # ME: In our first year ? # ME: You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a accessible and usable by sort of all age groups just t we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone user-friendly to everyone . # ME: Big target group . # PM: yes , yes , I don't think we have to I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , making that a key point , just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that . # PM: What are your experiences with remote controls ? # PM: I mean I've got we got we had three videos , a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls , that you programme each of your things into , # PM: but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again . # PM: I think it was quite a cheapie as well , so that might have had something to do with it , but that was quite good , the fact that you could You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you . # ID: Use all the ones at the same time . # UI: you wanna integrate everything into one like # ME: My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme T_V_ and uh videos and things . # ME: But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , I don't think I could go any further with it than that , so , I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well . # PM: the main that's the main stuff anyway , I mean and you don't want to I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that . # ME: And symbols that you don't necessarily understand , symbols you're meant to understand that you don't . # UI: So simplification of symbols you could think of . # PM: When they're when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it . # PM: 'Cause it doesn't make when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at , it's obvious what you're doing , . # ME: Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display , # UI: Menu , alright . # ME: I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , so you've got a little L_C_D_ display . # UI: I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , and with menus . # UI: And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe . # PM: What about the older generation ? # PM: What about granny and grandads ? # UI: You mean to save it lesser number . # PM: , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that . # ME: Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ? # PM: I don't think they tape things , # ID: , my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so # PM: I don't think they use # ME: So that's a problem regardless of any design modifications you come up with , that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps , # PM: Mm , the age gap . # ID: , what it just needs to be as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can work out what everything's doing , 'cause I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do . # ID: But I don't know how # PM: I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system . # PM: I find it really confusing , I kept getting lost in the phone , I di I've not got a new one but my friend got a new one and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , but that's just me . # ID: , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get , you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume . # ME: Is it possible that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ? # PM: Teletext has got that option as well . # ME: Obviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing . # PM: Or what about kind of a dual function ? # PM: In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that . # ME: The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the flip over . # PM: I think that's a cost thing , I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about # UI: It might it might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small . # PM: Yes , no that's important . # UI: But it might have its cost implications . # ME: , like smaller . # ME: And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ? # ME: Something that's easily moulded and produced . # ME: Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys . # PM: , right , okay we've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things . # PM: I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation . # ID: Just just a quick thing about the about what you're saying about the does it need to be fashionable ? # ID: The sort of I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the we put the fashion into electronics , so I think the whole design thing might be qui I mean you don't you can still have plastic and it'd look quite good but # ME: But , I mean it doesn't have to be that , you know th that was my main point , we don't have to use metal , I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper , I presume it would . # PM: I would it would probably . # PM: I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything . # PM: They're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter , so I guess that's stuff we can think about . # PM: Okay , so let's break it up there . # PM: So , see you in half an hour . # ME: Do we go back to our room ? Yep ?
# PM: It's up there ? That screen's black . # PM: Alright , okay . Okay , that's fine . # PM: Right , okay , this is our second meeting and I might be a bit all over the place . # PM: , right our agenda for today , do you want us to give you a second ? # ME: no that's okay , # PM: I'll go over what we decided last meeting , we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , T_V_ , video equipment . # PM: , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . # PM: We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know that kind of s thing . # PM: , our budget would have to affect try not to reflect our budget , that we might have a bit of oh you can see it , okay . dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . # PM: want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . # PM: We discussed a flip-open design , reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel for further features like programming , things like that . # PM: three presentations , I've got written here so shall we hear from Marketing first ? # ME: is it okay if I postpone that til later , I just want to get access to a little bit more information , # PM: No that's fine , that's fine . # ID: Okay , I'll go first . # ID: Can I grab the # ID: What do I have to press ? # PM: , F_N_ function F_ eight . # ID: Yep there we go . # ID: Okay this is the working design , presented by me , the Industrial Designer extraordinaire . # ID: 'Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so . # ID: What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design ? # ID: Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel or the volume , everything is just some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . # ID: , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . # ID: But although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that well it wasn't really my area because I'm dealing with the inside really . # ID: So , I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one . # ID: and I found out that most controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of something like the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . # ID: , most of them are powered by some form of battery . # ID: Now our one , I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else so we could shrink down the size of the control . # ME: Could I can I interject to ask a question there , is that appropriate ? # ME: You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the surrounding it ? # ID: if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries , they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in . # ME: the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ? # ID: well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption # ID: and how much you need to send the data across . # ID: , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . # ID: , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . # ID: Now the main components I came up with were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , as I said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from the controller Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . # ID: And then I was just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the interface designer . # ID: And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do . # ID: It's not a proper circuit , I'm not sure if it'd work or not , I'm not even confident that those are the real the real way you'd wire it up but anyway , we've just got the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the U_I_ interface which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using and since that that's another use and reason to use that infrared because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment . # ID: And then finally , we want the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are low in cost so that should be good . # ID: it should be different enough from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about , because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , I th that was just sort of a general point there . # ME: That's a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that , whenever you like me to present . # ID: Alright okay , and , that's what I came up with there , # PM: Okay , thank you very much . # ID: so if you wanna # PM: , would you like to continue on from that ? # PM: Or , maybe move the laptop over . # UI: okay , that's okay with me . # UI: Why's it not working ? # UI: F_ eight , right ? # ID: Function F_ eight . # UI: Mm why's it in the right ? # ME: The plug hasn't come out at the bottom , has it ? No . # UI: , it's connecting . # ME: Meter adjusting . # UI: Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention , but basically my method was like whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll take a feedback from the marketing because , I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . # UI: So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make it as simple as possible . # UI: And to summarise I would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . # UI: But we are to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will this two features together . # UI: So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . # UI: So it's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of audience and we can punch in new f features such as added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . # UI: Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not of no use of punching in the trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . # UI: As we saw we have to make a profit also so we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ? # UI: with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly . # UI: , that's so this is if you ask me personally , I would make flip-top with a trendy uh design and s maybe we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after continuous use usage and all that . # UI: So in overall a simple and user-friendly design . # UI: any comments like , if you want ? # PM: , I think we'll chat about it at the end , okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , Ooh , it's vibrating , that's strange . # UI: I think you'll have to # ME: Have I got to keep this here ? # ME: Does it matter ? # UI: It'll have to this can't be pulled . # ME: I'll have t I'll have to move it won't I ? # PM: We just do the best we can . # UI: You'll have to push it a bit more . # ME: Will it manage ? # ME: Bit more , oh dear . # UI: this is more than enough . # ID: There we go , I've got a bit more of the cable . # UI: I think you can pull it out now . # ME: Thank you , just pull it closer a little bit . # ID: you should be able to and # ME: Get it right over , okay , thank you . # ME: I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . # ME: , so that's where we started , we used our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there . # ME: Our findings , lots of findings , I've just summarised some of them here . # ME: The overall thing which I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . # ME: , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . # ME: Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but that's quite a high proportion of our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . # ME: , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . # ME: For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . # ME: So again there's power implications there . # ME: , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . # ME: and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . # ME: the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were something that you mentioned earlier , remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , fifty percent were particularly frustrated by that . # ME: thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . # ME: , slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for repetitive strain injury . # ME: You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . # ME: the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . # ME: Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . # ME: , that trend reverses in the older age groups . # ME: So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they're not so bothered with this . # ME: I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you , but I think I'll just keep it simple , if there's any more information I can email you extra details , # PM: we have new project requirements , we're not going to be using teletext , apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . # PM: our control is only going to be for T_V_ , it's not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us , but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer . # ME: so can we not programme a video with this remote control ? # PM: It says for T_V_ only , so looks like it's just # ME: Just channel-hopping . # PM: I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but I don't know , what do you think ? # PM: It just said , for T_V_ only . # PM: But I mean , general T_V_ controls do video as well . # ME: Would that imply video use ? # ID: I d well I dunno 'cause the w if you've g # PM: I mean you bu well som you get com you get combined T_V_ and videos don't you ? # ID: and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so . # PM: I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming . # UI: Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ? # ME: we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about ten percent of the buttons , # ME: I think th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video , fast-forwarding , so on and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare # ID: Ju just as an idea on the speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing and they're not that great anyway . # ME: In fact I've just called up that table there , # ID: Alright , okay . # ME: we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we didn't differentiate . # ME: Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen , that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ? # ID: Alright , okay . # ME: So you can see how the yes no sort of varies across the age group there , and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group , I think that's just general fear of new technology . # ID: but on that again I just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is so I thought that could be quite a # PM: We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing because it is something I it needs to be the thing that you use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , you were saying whistling , maybe on the T_V_ you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps and you're like oh okay it's over there , something like that , # ME: That's a super idea . # PM: but that's that sounds a lot cheaper to me . # PM: the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . # PM: so we want logo , we want fashionable , trendy , I mean what you were talking about with the marketing . , people paying more for it to look good . # PM: , we need to focus on that as well . # ME: further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market . # ME: What is attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , I dunno , you get the idea . # ME: It's it's gonna vary around the world . # ME: At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it's the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world . # UI: So are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs ? # ID: Well y you could you could have a number of different designs # ID: I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same . # UI: The features could be same and the body could look slightly different . # PM: What about you were talking about the buttons , the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , I mean , 'cause we got to make it original , what about you know with the touch screen computers # ID: , that's what I was just . # PM: so you it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either , not sure about the # ID: No , well no 'cause you wouldn't have to you don't actually have to press them you just # PM: You don't have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it . # PM: , think that might appeal I'm thinking kind of Japan , I'm thinking young , office people , trendy kind of a thing . # ME: Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def # PM: but quite , easily labelled so that anyone can oh that's obvious what that's for and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations , # ID: But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs , ergonomics there's sort of physically different things 'cause if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big # ID: because they're c just generally Japanese people have smaller hands so they couldn't get round the controller which is so if you I don't know what 'cause you obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others . # UI: , maybe to as it was indicated that uh risk of repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that . # UI: So , a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you're desi dividing it according to the countries also , the market . # UI: Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small , . # PM: I think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , . # ME: Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely . # PM: It's gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different possibilities , . # ME: I'm concerned , when you read the R_S_I_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that . # ME: , R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements . # ME: I'm j I really can't get my head round this one , this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about . # ID: I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel # ME: I know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes I know . # ID: and it becomes # PM: Or a speech recognition , # ID: speech recognition , # PM: which is extremely expensive , I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid that kind of issue . # ME: Do we have to initially , you know looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . # ME: Do we really have to go for everyone right away ? . # UI: We could focus on the biggest market . # UI: If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ? # ME: And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people . # PM: we're talking about the type of company that we're working for as well . # PM: That they want it to be fashionable , they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume associate that with the older generations . # PM: Now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people , but I don't think we're focusing on that , I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range , business kind of class type people . # ME: I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate and you know focus on where the idea will be taken up , first it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this . # PM: Okay , so the remote control functions . # PM: we've got the T_V_ , we've got the video , now there's I can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details , # PM: We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that I always found that really easy when I discovered it , because you've got your general record anyway so if you there's a programme on you want to put record on , that's fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to , you put the number in # ID: Just whack in the number . # PM: and it's just a number , it's not a date , it's not a time , it's not a channel , it's not when it finishes , it's not anything like that , # PM: it's just a number . # ID: And you wouldn't you wouldn't need a whole host of extra buttons for that , you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway , # PM: You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway . # ME: I've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful . # PM: if you look in the newspaper , T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards # PM: and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times , and it has been around for quite a long time . # ID: It's been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things . # PM: No it's not but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that # ID: Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series . # ID: But just to have that function would be would be really good . # ME: Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me , I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with their design features , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it , they'll phone the company , you can use their telephones . # ME: Is it worthwhile with our retail outlets having a similar kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it I press for this ? Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ? # ID: But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they the companies who you deal with have actually they've got an obligation to help you out and also I mean it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having # PM: The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there , you're pressing this button and your T_V_'s not doing it . Taking your T_V_ and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing , it's not working , what should I do ? # ME: If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel , but I mean for if there were any more or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for T_V_ and video , # ME: we're not gonna put any okay , just a thought . # ID: I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that . # PM: Instruction manuals . # PM: But I mean they're there's customer service , there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to # PM: and that way there's no call out charge , there's no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , . # UI: I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that . # ME: Not for such simple functions # ID: , they should be f . # ME: because we're focusing on that , # PM: But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible # PM: because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages . # ME: Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes . # PM: you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about . # PM: , what other functions ? # PM: We need I'm not sure if we need a design decision now , but we should think about c 'cause you've got the dilemma between oh batteries , that's what I was thinking about . # PM: Mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ? # ID: they're specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but # PM: Well they la they last quite a long time , and if you had when you th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something , but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged . # PM: , something like that should reduce the size of it . # ID: if you if you had if you had one of those just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could # PM: it could be on that # ID: on that as well so . # UI: So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ? # ID: some sort of docking station or # PM: Rechargeable with a docking station . # PM: So the rechargeable which would be your field . # ID: th that that'd be fine , and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time . # PM: which it is cheaper in the long run as well . # PM: , th the shape you got trendy . # PM: I don't wanna big box with lots of things , you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either , because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple , # ME: And we don't w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical , # ME: these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . # ME: We definitely an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we don't want that . # PM: Okay so we've got a flip-screen . # UI: What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h came up with almost six or seven years back . # UI: Basically we have a flat one it looks like a box , like a chocolate . # UI: That's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here , and you don't have to you don't bend your thumb too much , so it's like you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat . # ME: Slightly curved , curved . # UI: G so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like . # UI: So it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't # PM: 'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway . # UI: so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your the way you h hold of it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom , something like that . # UI: I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but smooth . # PM: Can you look into the company logo ? # PM: , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product . # PM: I mean for example , if it was a C_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something , something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite obviously into the design , while also making it quite different from anything else that's there . # UI: We could look in at that but Mm . What we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells , # ME: I mean look at the mobile . # UI: logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of the model , rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like . # PM: Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different . # ME: I think that's that sounds a really attractive idea , # ME: I've not come across anything like that before , if it kind of and that opens out into your flip-top . # ME: Then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think . # ME: I think it's a really nice idea # UI: we could look in at that . # ME: and plus you can get you know even though we're using plastic , you can still I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior . # PM: Or you could do different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . # PM: You could have different kind of casings . # PM: So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and # ME: Less chance of it being lost too , it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't not gonna lose it so much either . # ME: It's easier to bit nice to handle . # UI: maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like , that could be the most common design . # UI: But we can like think of five , six designs . # PM: Right , I think we have to round it up , # ME: Can I just quickly go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything . # ME: So it's no teletext , it's only for T_V_ and by implication video , our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , something about Videoplus . # PM: That was in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date # ME: Right , so when they press for programming you it comes up on the L_C_D_ , a reminder about using Videoplus ? # ME: So that they have a look at the guide and Or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just that was an add-on feature ? # PM: It's kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that . # ME: Right , so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature ? # PM: it could be it c it could be adv advertisement feature , rather than design feature , you know , drawing attention to that . # PM: And it also paid lip service in the instruction manual , 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful . # ME: Mm , and the rechargeable batteries . # ME: Was there anything else there that we in the new project requirements ? # PM: We've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it , . # ME: That's not at the moment a requirement , it's something we're looking at , # ME: what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like . # PM: And we've talked about there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , . # UI: For detection , right . # PM: Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . # PM: But there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the I the instruction manual , I don't know if we deal with that , . # PM: and different from what's out there . # PM: Yep , I think that's us . # ME: What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? # ME: Or shall I just sort of generally look at all the issues involved ? # PM: I think you might get guidance , Instruction manuals , 'cause there tends to be a demonised thing , u , they're everyone's got like a big pile of them , but no one really uses them . # ME: Whoops , questionnaire four . # PM: Yes , right . Okay . # UI: I think it's time for us to get back to # ME: 'Cause we're at lunchtime now I think . # PM: I think you can email me , if there's any more questions . # PM: and I'll be able to not answer them .
# PM: I'll wait until you're all hooked up . # ME: Oh good grief . # PM: Put it on in that way . # PM: Welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . # PM: Right this is our conceptual design meeting , I think we're slightly ahead of ourselves from the last meeting , # ID: , I was getting that impression as well . # PM: This is where we talk about properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching . # PM: So I think we've touched on a few things to do with that already , but we'll just go over it . # PM: the minutes from the last time . # PM: we had a couple of changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . # PM: we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being a flip design and a different shape from what's normal . # PM: We were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what's normal , . # PM: You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , things like that , and our market was going to be young , business , kind of range . # PM: Okay , so shall we start with the first presentation ? # PM: Yes if you feel # ME: We just connect up . # ME: so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . # ME: the methods we used to decide on current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional our usual market research study with a hundred subjects and the general feedback from them is that the most im w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , # ME: sorry Project Manager . # ME: we decided on the most important aspect i required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later . # ME: So that was one of the first things we did . # ME: Also with our company being forerunners in putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan . # ME: so the general findings from that was in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the current functional look and feel of remote controls . # ME: They also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . # ME: Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . # ME: So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the subject group we looked at . # ME: now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , we found from our consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . # ME: So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? # ME: There also seems to be a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , again in contrast to last year . # ME: So a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan . # ME: Be interesting to see what our design people make of that . # PM: Okay thank you very much . # PM: let's start from the inside and work our way out . # UI: Fine . It's okay with me . # ME: Unless anyone has any questions about that ? # PM: I don't think so , not yet . # PM: , yes , thank you . # ID: That screwed in ? # PM: I hate those little things especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them . # ID: this is all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . # ID: Okay , first the Into the method . # ID: The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . # ID: also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available . # ID: , findings , I've got my nice little picture there . # ID: This is the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and it's pretty much used for all T_V_ remotes at the moment . # ID: and then we we're loo looking into battery options . # ID: There's actually no rechargeable option available , I saw the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , I thought that might be a bit silly to be to be honest , # PM: can you explain that ? # ID: people won't it's basically like wind-up radio . # ID: So you wind up your remote control before you use it . # PM: what kind of how l long can you get out of that , # PM: I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ? Or # ID: , oh I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when you got T_V_ . # PM: That doesn't count though does it ? # ME: Does does light charge as sunlight does ? # PM: I thought it was U_V_ like # ME: Artificial light ? # ME: Has to be solar . # UI: Regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space . # ID: it would the d the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up . # PM: I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun . # PM: , I don't think it counts electric lights # ME: Artificial light , no . # PM: but I mean not many you don't want to limit your market . # ME: That's going to # PM: I mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people , but there are people . # ME: different parts of the world too , if we're if we're marketing internationally . # ID: and most people most people also watch T_V_ in the in the night anyway . # PM: Mm , but then it would be charging through the day , I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening . # ID: But I think I think the next one's the best anyway . # ID: The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches # ID: and you d you don't even notice it . # ID: I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would charge it up , I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work . # UI: And are these like what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ? # ID: it charges into some form of it's a smaller cell which it charges into and the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery , 'cause they use them quite frequently in watches . # ID: And that'll that would l would last for well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out . # PM: But then if you think about a watch , it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time so you're walking around , you're doing things , it is moving a lot of the time . If you'd I mean you switch the T_V_ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side . # ID: but then again # PM: Is it really gonna be enough ? # ID: I think it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it's only a tiny amount it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side . # ID: And th for the same the same reason , you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it # PM: So it's not the draw on it isn't # ID: and you put it no I do I don't think the draw on it would be # ME: Could I just ask referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with standard batteries ? # ME: I mean , could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging # ID: Ye I think I th g y you could have a dual power thing # ME: or the two things not compatible ? # PM: Like a dual kind of . # ID: but the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because , if you lie on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical . # ME: So that affects the exterior design . # UI: Solar would be slightly expensives . # PM: Expensive as well . # PM: What kind of price are we looking at for # ID: They're they're expensive , they don't # UI: It's twelve point f # PM: I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ? # ID: the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the solar charging ones , but the It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping , 'cause if you drop stuff if you if you have y # PM: Well they're not designed # ID: the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if remotes always get thrown around and stuff , so . # PM: Practical-wise okay . # ID: Y I think , practically . # ID: I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do , # PM: You do get a bit of wear # PM: but don't calculators have a battery in them as well ? # ID: they do , they've got dual things , but they're the batteries are smaller I think . # UI: Another question is like # UI: W w which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day . # UI: A remote control , like , so we have to s look at the life also . # ID: the s if you if you had something du using the standard batteries and the solar charging , I don't think you'd I think the it would d well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in or triple A_s would last . # ME: It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature , # ID: I think i I think it would , . # ME: i it's not gonna add anything , okay . # PM: Okay , can we add in an attachment to closing feature ? # PM: Can we think about that ? # PM: 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's # ME: Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I personally # PM: Well add it in to think about # PM: because , where am I ? # PM: If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of we're doing something original and different but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you wouldn't lose it so much . # PM: But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than the eternal battle for control of the controls . # ME: It's not something that's come up in any of our focus groups and market research , it's not a thing that people are looking for when we threw it open to the field . # ME: But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe . # ID: well I'll move on . # ID: , my second part of my findings most current remotes use this silicone P_C_B_ board which pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each switch is connected to two different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts . # PM: What kind of things do we have to consider there ? # PM: what kind of size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of # ID: well this the thi the thing about is they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that it's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . # ID: If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , if you if you wanted to but the there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit so that And then to , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . # ID: Now what I was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote , but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up . # ID: , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case housing the main problems with the well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical . # ID: Titanium very expensive just to process , which to make it is expensive , and rubber , well you're saying that people like this spongy feel this year , so perhaps some something made of rubber , but I was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've said that they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_ . # ID: I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said . # ID: the problem with the casing is that there's quite there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case . # ID: If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes . # ID: But whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units # UI: Second thing is # ID: for the flip phone . # UI: and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever . # UI: So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that . # UI: So is that feature available in like titanium , or it's like only specific to plastic or # ID: in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really , the ju just it w well you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for a remote . # ME: It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . # ME: I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . # ME: I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , # ME: that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone . # ID: And you can peel them off . # PM: So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber , # ME: Like a rubber sleeve almost , . # UI: Something like # PM: like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can you can pull that off . # UI: That could be a good idea . # UI: It could it would be comfortable to hold on also . # ME: Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to . # PM: Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not . # ID: Also the just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen . # ID: Now what I was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection over if you had them close enough , that would be one option . # ID: the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen 'cause one they're incredibly thin and don't take up much space , two they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch # UI: Sorry I didn't get the last part , you're talking of # UI: Just what you said I didn't get the meaning of it completely , you're saying like # ID: Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could becau you could fit it the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve curved things with it , but you can you wouldn't have with the L_C_D_ you'd have the wires coming off , you wouldn't have that with the with the L_C_D_ , you'd only have that with the printed circuit board . # ID: W also with the # ME: s sorry to interrupt , I don't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we for example had a shell , once we open that # PM: Oh it would be flat inside . # ID: You could have a flat screen inside , # ID: but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside . # ME: Have I misunderstood you ? # ID: It wouldn't be like full colour , it would just be black and white , but there'd be touch buttons , so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_ . # PM: I think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside . # PM: Now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , I mean # ID: I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest . # ME: I just had another idea , I don't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the R_S_I_ . # ME: Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to . # ID: you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out # PM: Like one of the palm pop thing . # ID: but I think they could get a bit easily lost , # UI: Absolutely , f for somebody who very often , if he would # PM: It would have to be attached . # ME: They're easy to replace as well , cheap . # UI: a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever . # ME: just a thought they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got , couldn't they ? # ME: A pencil or a pen , so they wouldn't really need a # PM: Okay , we'll talk about that so if you finish your and we'll come back to that . # ID: that that's the end of m my # PM: That's you , right okay . # UI: And just one small question before like you are , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know . # ID: that would be fairly simple , I mean you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking . # ME: I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so I'm not sure how it would fit in . # ME: If we flip open , now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ? # ME: And they kind of respond to the turn of your body . # ME: Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th the remote control display thing . # PM: We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women . # ME: They don't look at themselves ? # ME: Just a thought . # PM: Well it's a remote control , you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_ # ME: I know what you mean , it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think , okay . # ME: trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much but maybe we'll leave that one on the side . # ID: I mean you can you could do it , you could have a 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out , but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , I'm not sure about # ME: Oh I think forget about the mirror # ME: that was just a very quick passing thought . # UI: would like to share something which I did here . # UI: First thing is basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . # UI: Second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . # UI: So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white . # UI: So you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here . # UI: And second thing is there's too much of confusion here . # UI: No particular remote is standard . # UI: Like , some people have a Here you see this ? # UI: This is on a I found th that only common feature is the ch channel control and volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all . # UI: Okay , and second as already discussed with William , we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top and g graphic user interface # ME: Sorry what does that stand for ? # UI: basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , which is # ID: If you if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this L_C_D_ screen . # UI: Like you have on a l icons or something y you have is a good example of G_U_I_ graphic user interface . # UI: So basically not point or click Press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify . # UI: And on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . # UI: So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer . # UI: So we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels . # PM: Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ? # PM: 'Cause if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone . # ME: No you'd hold it you don't if you flip it open then you'd be Wouldn't you ? # ME: Isn't that the idea ? # ME: if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you've got your L_C_D_ display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand , . # PM: That's what I was just saying , # ID: , but you can do it with your thumb li # PM: and then have the and then have the L_C_D_ at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls , # UI: and you mean to the # PM: so have the volume and the programme , things like that , # UI: And the lower distance . # PM: on the lower side . # UI: So the findings are too many cluttered buttons . # UI: Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons . # UI: All are confusing and in inconsistent . # UI: Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . # UI: We have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost , but for like we had g s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it . # UI: So it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers I am here . # UI: Some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more you can say trendy also ? # UI: And technologically innovative also . # UI: So we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this . # UI: My personal preferences would be like , as already marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit , but we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , red chilli tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like for example , i if you see the previous slide # UI: I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we would not change h that particular pattern because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls . # PM: I can't see that , is that play and stop and things ? # UI: This is central one , the one you # PM: Or is that volume and channel ? # UI: volume and channel . # UI: So keep that m that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models , if you look at all the models , it's here . # UI: This and voice recognition . # PM: I'm not sure how long we've got left , but we need to make a decision about the things we've discussed . # PM: So , we agree on Do we agree on the battery ? # PM: , that means that there's no function for li the port , you know that it sits in , then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . # PM: It's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget , it's a # ID: I mean if it is it is qui it's quite a cool feature to have # PM: selling point . # ID: and also if they've got it if they've got these parts already in stock , then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them , or it will be cheap sorry to re-manufacture them . # ID: So do you reckon that's a good idea that , where's the remote , I'm here thing ? # ID: I think that would be quite fun . # PM: I think the only I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , but I think pretty much we've used cheap relatively cheap and simple things . # PM: The L_C_D_'s not cheap . # ID: to s th well it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one , I mean they use them in calculators so . # UI: Maybe we could start with the black and white . # UI: That that way we could upgrade later . # PM: And you could # ME: , we talked about kinetic charging , we've deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries ? # PM: Do you want like a back-up ? # ME: one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A_ or triple A_ batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they ? # ID: the kinetic ones come with a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch . # ME: Right , okay , got you . # ID: So it's a lot smaller , so it would # ME: Got you on that okay , didn't realise . # PM: , okay so we've got battery . # PM: The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it ? # PM: So there's not a really a decision to be made there , . # PM: The buttons what did you give us as our The bare-board L_C_D_ or # ID: the well I think were we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one , on the buttons , on the on the on the top one we're gonna # PM: On the top one okay you've got the touch and then # ID: On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti-R_S_I_ ones . # ME: Sorry could you repeat that last part ? # ID: , okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons . # UI: For the body design I think plastic , # UI: we could use the body , # PM: For the inside . # UI: for the inside and rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design . # ME: so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs , # PM: Oh I think so , I think so . # ME: and it is just although it's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours , we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed , # ME: just go for the colours . # PM: we don't wanna be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it psychedelic , you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , but that's not really what we're focusing on , what we're focusing on is the m you know # PM: So we could just pick anything . # ME: Is that going to be this image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that's spongy . # ME: Is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research , # UI: I it's different . # PM: It's just different # ME: is that fancy ? # PM: it's just different from everything else and I mean , I'm trying to imagine clean looking houses , sort of beige and black so you either want something that goes with that , which is what's on the market anyway , or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and # ME: I'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , but I mean I totally agree . # ME: We looked at those remotes , I mean they are kind of anonymous , very similar looking things . # ME: This would definitely be different enough , I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more # PM: And you would just have an across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little # ME: Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year's time we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming I mean it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on , # PM: And ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes # ME: which is another beauty of it . # PM: y you know , you could just go so far with it , # ID: You can you can just # UI: Acupressure , you could talk of acupressures . # PM: like a puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever , so I think that's quite a flexible thing . # UI: And finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside , it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time . # ID: j with these rubber these rubberised ca not the actual plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside . # UI: Okay . The rubber . # PM: Okay we've got five minutes , or that might've been up for a while . # ME: Mm , so can I just recap Sarah , for the decisions that we've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries , L_C_D_ display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . # ME: That's how far we've got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ? # UI: Fine , we were talking of voice recognition also because that we are not for how to look it remote control if it's lost . # UI: So , are we looking at voice ? # ME: Yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost , # UI: Or maybe like William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains . # ME: is that right ? # UI: For l , the whistle . # ID: the whistle ones , . # UI: So we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle . # ME: And incorporating the company logo ? # UI: I didn't mention this , but we'll be incorporating in the design . # ME: 'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it's our product # PM: but I think we can you could # ME: Since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours . # PM: well it is , it is , I think you just address that with advertising . # PM: , you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you . # PM: Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . # PM: The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but I think it does , without that so I'm not worried about that . # ME: I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ? # PM: Depending on how i # ID: , depending on the expense of it . # PM: I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into , so # ID: And they've got in stock , # PM: that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it's worth thinking about . # PM: But I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards . # PM: Right I'm going to wrap it up there . # PM: I got a end meeting now message on my mo # UI: Again a questionnaire huh ? # PM: so I think we've probably got it says , closing we have forty minutes # ME: You got to go through . # PM: so I think we've probably got about that time before we come back . # PM: It's either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and don't know how long that took . # UI: I think we are pretty going in a clear direction now . # PM: Is everyone happy ? .
# PM: If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time . # ME: Is that someone's ? # PM: three , apparently . # PM: you all switched on . # PM: I presume we're good to go . # PM: minutes we decided to use a kinetic charger , standard chip , 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't uh gonna be a problem factor . # PM: We wanted a stand-by function . # PM: The case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . # PM: buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design . # PM: bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel . # PM: and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . # PM: and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_ . # PM: Prototype presentation . # ID: Is that for us ? # PM: I think that would be you . # UI: Me and William worked on a prototype , and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that . # ID: Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it # UI: I can hold it like # PM: Make sure the camera's # ID: and I'll show you the presentation . # ID: Can I just nick your # PM: Yes , yes you can . # PM: Wait a second , I'll get it out . # ID: Going a bit crazy over here . # PM: You should have one of those things and you can just take it off . # UI: where are the hinges ? # ID: Okay , so this is our look and feel presentation , the final our final presentation . # ID: And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've come up with over there . # UI: You able to look ? # ID: It's gonna have a plastic body with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a white or a light blue or something . # ID: This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised outer casing which there'd be sort of a wide choice they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that . # ID: the wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it . # ID: it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design and the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of how do you say , it's yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top # UI: The black and white touch screen wherein people can # PM: Mm . So it's flush . # ID: and the buttons at the bottom would d so it'll fully close flat . # PM: Oh right , okay , . # ID: And working on the inside we've already said d decided on the kinetic batteries , which actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , so that you could probably get a bit of # PM: So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections , 'cause it's the top part that's # ID: we decided that the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . # ID: So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where is the remote and it'll shout back , I'm here , or something . # ME: Or something . # ID: And then It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something . # ID: It'll just shout out I'm here , or something to similar effect . # PM: I'm under the sofa . # PM: Or , that would be too complicated . # ID: if it was going like I d tha that could be something for next time , maybe . # ID: You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is . # ID: the standard , there's be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using all the standard chips that we've talked about . # ID: it would it would have obviously 'cause it's split over two different layers , it would need two separate P_C_B_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling . # ID: And because , obviously , all T_V_s use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using the same thing to transmit the data . # ID: And the infrared sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the we haven't I don't think we actually put it on . # ID: , something like that . # UI: Infrared could be here also . , here . # PM: Actually , no , it would be it would have to be on the on the front . # ID: , on the front on the front side of that , . # UI: So when it's even if it's open here , the signals would go . # PM: Oh right , okay , I've got you . # PM: It's still pointing , # ID: So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ . # PM: , that would make sense . # ID: And then finally on to the interface . # ID: The top screen , as we said , is would be an inset black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen # UI: This one right here . # ID: which would have all of all of the available functions for the remote on it , whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and things to that effect . # ID: And now we've we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have some kind of sort of bezzled logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top . # PM: But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product # ID: No d not actually . No , not interfering with l the whole look of the product when it's on the thing . # ID: And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics , # PM: Thank you very much . # ID: as that is that's the company logo . # PM: Wrapping it all up , # PM: I've now got evaluation criteria . # UI: this is the one . # PM: It's to be presented . # UI: Mm I think this is chip . # PM: It's quite similar to what it was before , though . # ME: This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the criteria that we got from our market research . # ME: So this is the first stage of the evaluation . # ME: the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . # ME: So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ? # ME: the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . # ME: The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours . # ME: The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function . # ME: Okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you don't have a note of those . # ME: I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . # ME: We're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false . # ME: We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned , I'll call that slide back up , and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here . # ME: Does that seem clear ? # ME: Any questions there ? # ME: we're going to look at these crite # UI: Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market # ME: we're going to come to w we'll discuss each one and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven . # ME: One is true , seven is false . # ME: Right . So I won't write all of that out again . # ME: It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , or A_ , B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ to confuse it with the number rating . # ME: This is where I realise how tiny I actually am . # PM: Just write small . # ME: Criteria and rating . # ME: Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . # ME: How about that ? # ME: So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who . # ME: Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel . # ME: How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel . # ME: One is true , seven is false . # ME: My own rating for that would be a two . # ME: One is true and seven is false . # PM: I would agree . # ID: I'd probably put it two , # ME: I'll just go this way . # PM: I would say two . # UI: I would say four . # ME: Adding those up , we've got a six and a five , eleven divided by four is what ? # ME: two and three quarters , it that right . # UI: Almost three . # ME: Two and three quarters ? # ME: Okay . Two point seven five , there we go . # ME: criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative . # ME: I would give that a three . # ID: I'd give it a one . # ME: Not that you're biased in that it the designer . # ID: No , no , not at all . # UI: I got it wrong . The first one rating , I'm sorry . # UI: Can you just make it two ? The first . # UI: I just it the other way . # ME: oh , for you ? You want your rating to be a two ? Is that what you're saying ? # ME: I'll work out the average for that again at the end . # ME: It's a very slightly altered # ME: and we're just waiting for your rating # PM: It's just two point five for that one . # ME: Two point five , okay . # ME: Losing one decimal place , that's okay . # UI: One is a , seven is false , # ME: So what are you rating for this one , Paw ? # ME: So that is eight . # ME: That brings it down to two , nice and simple , ease of use . # ME: Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true . # PM: I would say a two . I would say a two . # ME: I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy , shouldn't I ? # ME: We'll just put almost two , # PM: One point seven f five . # ME: because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places . # ME: Or we or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later . # ME: mm now we're looking at it incorporates current fashion trends , now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours . # ME: Right . So I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here . # ME: Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ? # ID: the base colour was white or like or l sort of a light blue , # UI: for the plastic ? blue . # ID: but the changeable fa faces would allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that th it's full sort of customised . # ME: So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do . # ME: And the spongy feel is no problem with that . # UI: because you'll be having a Because of the rubber case . # ID: 'cause th that's the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic . # ME: In that case it's got to be a one for me . # ID: , I'll give it a one as well . # ME: That part was nice and easy . # ME: moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury . # ME: I don't think we've really touched on that a lot . # ME: We've we've discussed it , we haven't really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that . # ME: We've talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ? # PM: the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_ # ID: It's meant to be . # PM: maybe because it's slightl with the size that we've got it's quite small , but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much . # PM: So maybe because there's more space , it's not kind of moving around trying to hit accurately the buttons in between . # PM: It's quite obvious just big buttons . # ME: I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four . # ID: I'd f I'd go for a five , actually , # ME: and a four okay . # ME: Twenty one is that twenty one ? # ME: So that's four point two five . # ME: And finally , last but not least , easy to locate . # ME: Now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , have we really have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ? # ID: it was it was a voice recognition , # UI: Voice r recognition . # ME: It was the I'm here thing , And are we happy with the costs on that ? That is going to be feasible , cost-wise . # ID: , that , that's feasible . # ME: That sounds good then . # ME: I'd go for a I ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on T_V_ . So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms , or . # ID: I think it would r I think it would probably be a stand it would be a stand # ID: it would be quite loud . # ID: So it would be s p # ME: You built into the feature . # PM: And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room . # ME: That's a one for me . # ID: I do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 'cause it is our product , # ME: how do we feel about this ? # ME: We've got our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the six criteria there . That is for incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . # ME: The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , i it's close around neutral is for the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . # ME: Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ? # PM: I don't think so . # ID: W I thin I think # ME: We happy to go ahead ? # PM: I think we . I think we're set . # ME: I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that . # PM: Do much apart from having a huge big # ME: Okay . Well , I hope that's clear to the team . # ME: Is there anything you would like to ask me about the findings before I sum up ? # PM: Don't think so . # ME: Good . Fine then . # ME: I'll just leave it there . # PM: I've got finance here now . # PM: I'm gonna plug this in so you can all see it , if that's okay . # UI: You want me to b unplug that ? # UI: That's all . Yes . # PM: I presume that the screen will go blank , We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value . # PM: So are we still on for kinetic ? # PM: See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . # PM: it might have influenced our choice . # PM: what's happening with the electronics ? # ID: It was a regular chip on print # UI: Chip on print . # PM: Double-curved . # ID: no , no , no , you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one . # ID: In the top , it's the number # PM: Oh , right , Thanks . # PM: So , would there be two ? # ID: one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker . # ID: And they're double curved . # UI: Single-curved . # PM: One double curve . # ID: 'cause it's two . # ME: But it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit . So it can rest . # PM: what's a single curve then ? # ID: I'd say I'd say it was w # ME: It would just be a flat bottom with one curve . like a domed thing . # ID: I think I think it's # PM: just one double # ID: One double-curved . # UI: Plastic and rubber . # ID: 'cause one , one's double-curved , and then the other one's # ME: The other curves at the sides , but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over . # PM: we've got plastic and rubber , # UI: Plastic one and maybe rubber point five . # ID: And special colour . # UI: I think rubber , since it's being used just as a casing , we can put point five . # UI: I think it allows the point five , We can use that . # ME: What does it mean if you put point five for that ? # UI: It means we are not using a lot of rubber actually . # UI: We're using just a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic . # PM: It would be like saying we're using See , it says case material . # PM: we're not actually using plastic in the case , # ID: that's it's as an extra . # PM: It's including , it's including . # ID: So that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there , because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get . # ME: But it is gonna be part of the total cost , and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in , is there ? # ME: There's nowhere else we can code for the rubber used in the casing . # ME: So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ? # PM: Okay , we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half . # PM: Or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway . # PM: No , we don't step on anyone's toes . # PM: special colour , do we need that ? # ME: Might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours . # ID: the push-button's one and L_C_ display one . # UI: I think we could change the battery also . # UI: Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery . # ME: Has that not made any d if you click off that square now , has that not made any difference ? # PM: Has that not gone up ? # ME: it's brought it slightly down . # PM: it was seven five it's changed not a lot . # ME: is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing , is that going to make a difference ? # UI: Uncurved , flat . # ME: it's not made any difference , # UI: it just surprises one . # ME: It's gone up again . # PM: it's not calculated it . # ID: you've got to click off to calculate it again . # PM: Okay , there we go . # ME: It's brought it down slightly . # PM: It's not a lot though . # UI: I don't think so . # ID: it might you might you might be assuming that is in Euros . # ID: It could be in Dollars . # ID: And then it would be fine , because the exchange range would make it about twelve . # PM: We haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though , # ME: Is there anything on the menu # UI: I think it's in Euro . # PM: so the highest we've got is the electronics here . and the interface . # ME: If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ? # UI: And going to a regular bat # ID: the standard , it would make one difference . # ID: The biggest one would be taking away if you took away # UI: What I feel is , customers never said anything about the battery . # UI: It's internal , nobody looks into the battery . # UI: But shape and colours , that's something we shouldn't comprimi # ME: And people are used to buying batteries , # ID: If if you take away the voice , # ME: they're not gonna say I'm not getting this , 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control . # ID: I do I don't like to say it , but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it . # UI: Where's that special form ? Mm mm . # ME: Should we see what difference it makes ? # PM: Where's the where's the voice recognition ? # ID: 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker . # ID: If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five . # PM: the kinetic is three . # PM: If we change it to the battery it's that's minus three . # ID: They n but you p minus three plus two . # PM: I keep seeing zero . # PM: We can do it some other way , we can do it doesn't have to be voice recognition . # PM: We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version . # PM: You could choose to have that or not . # ID: But they but I mean in I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product . # ME: But we're still working to head o # PM: So should we just change the design specification then ? # UI: Make it costly . # ME: We can put in our recommendations . # ME: If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings . # ID: We c we could s # ME: But we need to work to that specification to start with . # ME: And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful , but our object is so distinctive that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance . # ME: as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers # PM: we can make the price fit , and then say if we'd had our budget , we would've had this , # ID: And then say we recommend # PM: because it also sets it apart from the crowd . # ME: 'Cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it . # PM: They like their gadgets , they like something that's completely different . # PM: It's s something completely different associated with your company . # PM: Right , okay , so # ME: So if we take voice recognition out # ID: That'll do it . Twelve point three five . # UI: we are close to the budget . # ID: Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ? # PM: It's two point five . # PM: it's twelve point two five . # ME: Sorry , not meaning to doubt your words there . # PM: two , twelve point two five times two is twenty five , # ME: Are they really going to quibble about ten P_ ? Or point zero one of a Euro ? # UI: It's twelve point five maybe , then . # ME: Which is less than ten P_ . # UI: I don't know what it said fifty percent of the cost . # UI: So half of the price would be # PM: I think the agenda one was where the price was , wasn't it ? # UI: I think it is the first one . # ME: That's today's kick off meeting , . # PM: Twelve point five . # ME: Mm . I thought that's what it was . # UI: So we are under the budget . # PM: Well done , people . # PM: that got us covered for the electronics then ? # PM: We don't need something else to take that place ? # ID: 'Cause that was just a bought-on extra , you could just take that out and that would be fine , . # ID: I think that's brilliant . # UI: Except voice recognition , everything is # PM: so we've done that . # PM: Product evaluation . # PM: We've done room for creativity , haven't we ? # PM: Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make . # PM: I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork . # PM: in the sense that did you feel like a team ? # PM: Or did you feel like autonomy ? # ID: , I'd say , as a team . # UI: I think we had a nice time . # ME: Although we had our separate tasks , there was so much interaction , so much that we needed to bounce off each other . # ID: Find out from each other , # ME: And I've certainly felt heard , listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to , you know , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary . # UI: , I think there was very constructive feedback by everybody . # UI: It's not like people trying to cut each other . # UI: There is more of true cohesive teamwork . # UI: We came to a very predic creative design , . # UI: And Sarah , you coordinated the work very well . # PM: How did you find it ? # ID: I thought it went really well , I feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out , although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there , but that's good . # ID: I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , I think maybe it would've come out a d little different , # PM: I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , you know , it didn't matter it saying what you thought , because if it wasn't something that was that relevant , then it didn't matter , 'cause it was just another idea in the field . # PM: you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model . # UI: I think that was the best part # PM: I'm still not caught up . # PM: But that's nothing to do with the teamwork at all . # ME: Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line . And fake R_C_s . # PM: that was quite fun . # PM: means , whiteboard , digital pens , etcetera , what does that mean ? Any ideas ? # ID: Discuss which ones # ME: How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ? # ME: Could it've been better , was it adequate ? # ID: I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more , had we actually had more time and if we'd been separated more . # PM: Had time to kind of 'cause we could just sort of say , sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that , rather than having to email it , But it was nice having it there . like the whole picture of the thing . # UI: moving around the room . # UI: But I think it's good , like we spent times individually . # UI: I never thought of a remote control with a flip top . # PM: I think it's new ideas in general , # ME: It's really borrowing from other areas , it's , you know , bringing things from other areas in , # ME: it so it's I mean nothing is new , but it's applying it to a d in a different area . # PM: , no . Well they have to come from somewhere , don't they ? # UI: Yep , sorry , go on Sarah . # PM: as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls , remote controls , no one's thought about it particularly . # PM: I mean they're slightly different , so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's , 'cause it's w something we should think about , but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it . # ID: I don't think the companies are really concerned . # ID: They're just like we've got a D_V_D_ player , does anyone remember the remote control ? # ID: Can't you get the one that we used for the last one ? # ID: just jazz it up a bit . # ID: d they don't really think about it , because normally , the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship . # ID: They're trying to ship the D_V_D_ player , the video player , the T_V_ . # ME: , the focus isn't on to that , . # PM: But then when it everything is really smart , and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table , it doesn't go , I mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing , a funky item that's individual , individual to you , I mean they could even go into you go in with an idea and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic , you would pray you would pay a lot extra , because it's individually being a plastic was being made for you . # PM: But people could have anything that they wanted . # UI: Surprising to me is like people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like a real want to see a new launch or something like that . # PM: Because of the produ # UI: And new f television products coming up , but nobody giving much idea to this . # UI: Like Sarah was telling , everything's # ME: I think it's really good that this has been very market research based , because just going back to mobile phones , I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really , you know , say is obvious and visible . # ME: We see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from . # ME: There are innovations in that people don't really want . # ME: I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with , and they can't get it anymore and it's innovation for innovation's sake , and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based . # PM: it's innovation for money's sake . # PM: The the people have to keep buying . # ME: But forcing it onto people , It's things that , you know , they might want to buy the thing they really want . # PM: And you can't get you've got your handset that works fine , but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone , because the phones have moved on , things like that . # ME: Or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever , # PM: In closing There we go . # PM: our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased , but I think I don't know , what do you think ? # PM: Do you think that's takes into account overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing ? And the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ? # ME: I think it was just the produc just the production cost of the phone . # ID: I think that was just the physical . # PM: So it looks well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit , you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that . # PM: So maybe increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at . # UI: Maybe fifty percent more . # PM: But I think but you were saying that that's quite # ID: I think I don't from the market research . # ME: But I think in the remit that we were given , it was very specific . # ME: I think we've done what we were required to do , and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at those kind of things . # ME: I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for . # ME: I think we've done very well to get within budget and it still makes such an innovative item that I think people are really gonna want . # PM: It's a shame it won't ever get made . # PM: Maybe it will . # ME: Maybe it will . # ME: Maybe they are gonna steal our ideas # PM: Maybe someone'll r run down and patent it . # ID: I it's top secret . it's it is it's a conspiracy going on here . That's what it is . # PM: the project has been evaluated well and truly . # PM: and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire . # UI: There's a final questionnaire . # PM: we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that I fell behind with , # PM: so I'll be delegating in my role as Project Supervisor , so good luck . # UI: Celebration , you didn't talk about that . # PM: I think the celebration is the twenty five pounds . # PM: Either that or we'll be dancing on the desks . # ME: Questionnaire . # ID: Is that it then ? # PM: , just the last , I think . # PM: I think I've got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy . # ME: Questionnaire done . # ME: I didn't have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time . # ID: Was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you'd done in your thing ? # ME: But do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too ? # ID: the s I think , questionnaire seven was the one I did just before the meeting . # PM: I just got con .
# PM: Right , so start of the first meeting . # PM: Right , so agenda of the first meeting . # PM: Where we We have twenty five minutes for this meeting . # PM: We are to get acquainted . # PM: So does everyone want to say who they are ? # PM: that seem sensible ? # ME: I'm the Marketing Manager . # UI: I'm the User Interface Designer . # ID: I am the Industrial Designer . # PM: And I'm Alastair and I'm the project leader . # PM: Alright okay , so tool training . # PM: Project plan . # PM: So does anyone have any thoughts as to the tool training that is required ? # ID: Tool training # UI: I'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training . # PM: Oh I see , so we shouldn't really be Oh right okay , so . # PM: So we have the project team , which is to basically to come up with a new r remote control device . # PM: we have the starting base was the original which has been in existence now for a period of time . # PM: And our idea is to make the new remote control device more user friendly than the previous one , and to be trendier , to be with it , and therefore to get a bigger market share and bigger audience . # PM: method of doing this is split up as you can see into the functional design , the conceptional design , and the detailed design in each of these phases we'll basically be handing over to yourselves , the designers of this device . # PM: And having meetings so that we can during the course of the day come up with a better inst implement than we had before . # PM: And therefore have a successful conclusion to the day . # PM: and you'll be doing various designs throughout the day to meet this end . # PM: So we've got tool training . # PM: Try out whiteboard . # PM: Right so everyone's to supposedly draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there . # PM: I guess this is make sure the whiteboard works . # PM: So I don't know who wishes to go first . # PM: Do you wish to go f Have a first bash at whatever . # UI: Good job I got pockets today . # PM: But now you you'll move out from the microphone and the camera . # ME: Your microphone's just # PM: I take it that # UI: Are we supposed to do this right now , do you think , or ? # PM: I would I would guess so . # ID: You've lost your microphone there . # PM: Technical problems . # UI: Right here we go . # PM: I mean you designers are meant to come up with these sort of things . # UI: I think that I would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat . # UI: Little smiley cat there . # UI: and this would be because they're very independent , they're very intelligent , compared to dogs maybe . # UI: and they can be very affectionate . # UI: Some people don't think so but I know very affectionate cats . # UI: and they can look after themselves . # UI: Shall I rub that out , actually ? # PM: I don't see as there's any need to . # PM: There's plenty of space . # PM: I mean whatever . # ME: We can have a whole menagerie . # ID: Shall I see if I can get across without just tangling everything . # PM: We've had more time to prepare over this side , # PM: so we've all stuck our bits and pieces in our pockets . # ID: Didn't think of that . # PM: The three pens are underneath . # ID: pens are over here . # ID: I'll try the red pen . # ID: I'm gonna go for the bear which I'm be able to draw very well , # PM: You get marks for artistic impression . # ID: but I'll have a bash at it . # ID: Ooh ooh I lost it there . # ID: I think I've just knocked the microphone . # PM: So you're just doing the face . # ID: We'll g then we'll go for a s small bear . # ID: and I like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because I dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear like the jungle book characters and stuff like that . # ME: I'm gonna go for the dog , and I'm gonna draw one badly as well . # ME: looks like it's going to be a dachshund or something . # UI: That's quite good . # ME: Right . There's my dog . # ME: I like dogs because they're very loyal . # ME: And they're always happy , so whenever you're feeling sort of a bit a bit down or tired , they're always coming up and they're always quite excited . # ME: So you can always have a lot of fun with a dog . # ME: And they're also good for exercise as well . # ME: You can sorta get out and they sorta never get tired . # ME: And and when they're tired they're quite cute as well , so . # ME: Okay , that's why I like dogs . # PM: Well I've not actually had too many pets over my time 'cause to be honest with you I'm not too keen on them anyway . # PM: So what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got a few fish and so hopefully won't prove too difficult to draw . # PM: As you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as well . # PM: And one of the best things about fish is that they don't really take too much looking after because with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever , you've gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you . # PM: Whereas if you got fish , you just gotta put the food in a dripper feed which feeds them over the couple of weeks that you're away and change the water every couple of months , and buy in a few plants , so . # PM: Other than the fact that they keep dying , fish are not are reasonable pets in that they're low maintenance . # PM: if we're still all with us . # PM: Right okay , so . # PM: Work has been done on this project where by twenty five Euros is the expected selling price . # PM: That information has come from our marketing manager here . # PM: So we're looking to sell internationally , not just in Europe . # PM: We're looking at having our production costs limited to twelve and an half Euro per unit . # PM: And therefore making a profit margin of well not actually a profit margin it's because obviously you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to take from that to give you your profit margin per unit . # PM: And so depending what the overhead costs are will determine how many units we're looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time . # PM: Experience with remote control , first ideas . New remote . # PM: So I guess we're looking at having a discussion at this point in time to help you folks design our new model as it were . # PM: So any thoughts ? # ID: I with some remote controls the buttons were a little small so they're quite hard to press so maybe we make something with easy to press buttons . # ID: As that is the main function . # PM: Okay , so basically we're looking for some we're looking for a device that is robust and therefore won't get damaged too easily . # PM: we're looking for a device that is What was the other things you said there ? # ID: sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible . # ID: is easy to use and see . # UI: Can I just check ? # UI: Is this just a television remote ? # UI: Because a lot of systems are kind of T_V_ video combined now , or T_V_ D_V_D_ combined . # UI: And one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house . # UI: So if you've got a combined system , it could be a combined remote . # UI: Or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing ? # PM: basically I'll get back to you on that . # PM: But it seems to me sensible , 'cause as you rightly said , there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the about the room . # PM: So a device for all remotes . # ME: one of the things we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well . # ME: 'Cause there's quite often lots and lots . # ME: And sometimes they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room . # ME: So whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel , now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote . # ME: So so I don't we need to sort of maybe think about how we could maybe develop a remote control which moves around the room . # UI: Comes to your whistle . # ME: That's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television , but # PM: But is it in a sense it's r mutually exclusive . # PM: You can't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to 'cause you want you want simplicity as well , you want any idiot to be able to use it . # PM: Whilst at the same time you want , as you rightly said , one remote for all . # PM: And so these are probably mutually exclusive options you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes , therefore they're more with handling them , therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on . # ID: Maybe we could have better instructions with the remote . # ID: Or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself , or sort of the instructions that would come with it ? # PM: Better instructions . # ME: I mean we've done some research about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are , and a lot of them sort of use you know they're like they're like mini laptops . # ME: So it's possible that we could devise a system where you're basically sort of holding a miniature computer which is controlling all your sort of your television , your stereo , and where you know if you buy a new thing then it sort of you can link it to that as well , maybe . # PM: well we've got five minutes before the end of the meeting . # PM: So we have to start winding up . # PM: is there Next meeting in thirty minutes . # PM: Right , so we've got I_D_ the Come on , where's my # ME: If you just click return it should be okay . # ME: It'll get rid of the message . # ME: If you hit just hit return and it should get rid of the message . # PM: Oh there we go . # PM: That's what I was looking for . # PM: Right . So we've got function Oh what happened to the # UI: I think that might be back to the start . # UI: if you grab the kind of slide to the left and pull it down ? # PM: Sorry about that . # PM: Okay , so we've got the working design for I_D_ . # PM: For U_I_D_ the technical functions design . # PM: Marketing , the user requirement specification . # PM: Specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach . # PM: Are we all clear what objectives we're looking to meet in the next thirty minutes ? # PM: And I guess I'll try and write up some minutes of this meeting to give it to you for the next meeting . # UI: I'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for . # UI: Is this a mun multi-functional one or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it ? # ID: I think you just said at the start it was a television remote control , # PM: Television remote control . # ID: so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise . # PM: That's true , 'cause during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we're going . # PM: But at this point in time I think you're right that shall we make it just a T_V_ . # PM: So we will depart . # PM: We will stay here and break off . # PM: And I'll do minutes and we'll see you in half and hour . # ID: Okay , that's great .
# PM: So where's the PowerPoint presentation ? # PM: Microsoft PowerPoint , right . # PM: Right , okay . So . # PM: Okay , so we've got so we've got new project requirements . # PM: So basically we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to for this meeting to discuss the various options . # PM: Three presentations . # ID: We have a I guess we have a presentation each , 'cause I've got one . # ME: I've got one too . # PM: That's nice to know , one from each of you . # PM: new project requirements . # PM: so do we want to do the presentation first , or do we want to W I got or three things basically , relating to the remote being only for T_V_ . # PM: We discussed that last time and in actual fact that was pr pretty well what we came up with anyway . # PM: So in fact it actually f we won't be forestalled in a sense . # PM: we've got teletext outdated . # PM: did you get any information on that ? # PM: Right and the corporate image was the final thing . # ID: I d I didn't personally . # PM: So I got that in email form . # PM: Right okay . So I guess if we go ahead with the with the three presentations . # PM: So we'll start with yourself on the basis that # ID: Okay that's fine . # ID: I'll just I'll grab the wire out the back of this one . # ID: I'm not quite sure how it # UI: I think you've got to do control F_ eight . # ID: Control Doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment . # UI: Shift F_ eight . # ID: Alt function F_ eight . # ID: Again not doing anything . # ME: There's usually a little thing in the top right for the Oh hang on , # UI: it's doing something . # ME: it's just coming on . # ID: pressed about five times now . # ID: Okay , that's me . # ID: Okay , I have to go again . # ID: Hopefully that should be it this time . # ID: Okay , I think we're there . # ID: Okay I'm gonna be looking at the working design . # ID: of the of the remote control . # ID: I've just got three sections , first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself . # ID: And then that involves the components required in it and the systems design of the actual the actual remote . # ID: so having researched the existing models within the market , I found my research off the internet . I've established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are . # ID: And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television . # ID: the basic components are an energy source which I guess in most existing models would be a battery supply . # ID: Whether that'll be sort of two batteries , four batteries , it may vary . # ID: We then have the user interface , which is basically the like the buttons on the actual remote . # ID: the various functions used for changing channel , channel up and down , volume , things like that . # ID: there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things . # ID: And then the sender , which is usually , I've found , an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television . # ID: and the last part is receiver which is important in the system but is not actually part of the remote itself , because that's obviously found in the television . # ID: I'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working , so . I'll just go through there . # ID: S um do we have a cloth to wipe this down with , or ? # PM: there's the rubber on the right , I think . # UI: I think it's that little # ID: I'll get rid of the bear.$ # ID: Okay that's great . # ID: Okay , so we start off with a battery suppl a power supply which we'd probably get it's probably gonna be the battery . # ID: we then have a particular button , which may be that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons . # ID: but this is how the basic system works . # ID: that sends after you press that sends the message to the chip , which then sends It sort of interprets which button you've pressed and then sends the appropriate message to the sender . # ID: So that's . That's the remote in itself , that's the components of the remote and how they work together . # ID: So this is the user interface . # ID: this is the chip itself , which then , and that's the that's the infra-red sender . # ID: And then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a receiver . # ID: And the sender sends a message to the receiver . # PM: So the top bit's the power source , yes ? . # ID: yes , that's the power source . # ID: going on to personal preferences , I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote , just because of the size . # ID: You don't want a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not it's not really a remote . # ID: and then the sender , and infra-red has been used quite successfully . # ID: If the battery's on reasonable power , they always seem to work fairly well . # ID: You don't have to be point directly at the television itself . # PM: So the battery is the in the sender . # ID: 'Kay and that's it for the moment . # PM: So , now more design . # UI: Mine's not quite as complicated as all that . # PM: That's what we like to hear . # UI: Did I press function ? # PM: Is it control function ei Oh , th there you go . # UI: Okay so I'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design . # UI: I'm Louisa , the User Interface Designer , as you know . # UI: so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed . # UI: an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down , so obviously you need two different buttons for that . # UI: to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down . # UI: to switch the television on or off , maybe a standby button . # UI: here are two example remotes . # UI: by the look of it they both have kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions , so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about . # UI: but as you can see , the left remote is quite busy looking , quite complicated . # UI: whereas the right remote is much simpler , it looks much more user friendly . # UI: so my personal preference would be the right remote . # UI: So , it's got nice big buttons , it's got a very limited number of buttons . # UI: they're nice , kinda clearly labelled . # UI: I like the use of the kind of symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the kind of play functions and all that . # UI: So it's very user friendly , and it's got a little splash of colour . # UI: Could maybe do with some more colour . # PM: Well there's a couple of things there . # PM: we have to remember that we have our own logo and colour scheme . # PM: So basically we'd have to we'd have to be putting that on the product . # UI: Do we get to see that ? # PM: I haven't as yet , no . # UI: Will you be presenting that in a bit ? # PM: But I got I got an email that basically said to make sure that whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate the corporate colour and slogan . # PM: So I'm guessing that uh I notice on the bottom there it's got what's that ? # PM: A_P_O_G_E_E_ that might be the corporate colour scheme , although the only the only colour I can see in that is the red . # ID: Would you be able to get rid of the extra buttons here , the sort of circular section , because that seems to be for a video as well . # ID: So we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume . # UI: What do you mean by the circular section ? # UI: Like all of that bottom bit ? # ID: just this little bit is that I think that's still a video remote part , so maybe we could get rid of that as well . # UI: And I don't really think that you need nine numbers . # UI: I mean how often do you use seven , eight and nine ? # UI: I think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough . # PM: Well th the on the # UI: Like how often do you hit nine ? # PM: Well for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time , and we'd have to have some room for future such channels . # ID: It's just people are used to seeing that , so if we didn't have them then they might think it's # PM: well possibly but the other thing is that with the current expansion of channels in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down , but I mean how many channels do we have to actual television channels do we have to prepare for ? # PM: I would have thought that it's forever expanding and at the moment we've got although you've onl you've got the five standard , you've got the B_B_C_ have come up with a further six and there's I don't know exactly how many channels there are on when you take into account Sky and various other various others . # PM: So I would've thought that we wouldn't , you know , rather Okay , if the time of flicking from one to other , but presumably it'll take a second 'cause you have to be able to stop it . # PM: Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels and then you could dispense with more otherwise . # PM: Y you'd want you'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted . # UI: some remotes have kind of favourite options where if you always flick from channel one to channel six , if that's a favourite you just like by-pass two to five . # PM: , I s I suppose in a sense you could have if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want and that would cut down your time . # UI: But I think a lot of like Cable and Sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel , and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels . # UI: Like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers # PM: Limit the number of buttons , user friendly . # UI: But I suppose nine's not really excessive . # ID: I suppose with nine you've got the like the last one which makes the tenth means you it's like multiples you can put them together so you can make any number . # UI: I suppose it does make a good pattern . # ID: So with that we'd kind of by-pass any problems with # PM: Well that's true , you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever , that makes sense . # ID: 'Cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need . # PM: So w so what was the circular thing that you were # UI: I think that's just for a video , so we wouldn't need any of that at all . # ID: So we could get it down to what ? # PM: If it's just for T_V_ , which is what it is at the moment . # ID: So we get to How many buttons have we got ? # ID: We've just got ten , eleven twelve th We got fourteen that we need . I guess . # ID: which isn't really too many . # ID: That'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote . # PM: Well we've got that it's remote for T_V_ only otherwise project would become too complex with which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations . # PM: I'm I don't know d did you have that information behind the marketing , or was I meant to give you that information ? # ME: I had I've had some market information , but not from the company , no . # PM: Right , okay , so basically time to market seems to be important , therefore speed of delivery . # PM: We've only got about another four hours left . # UI: Okay , so is everyone happy with that ? # ID: yes , that seems good . # UI: Right well that's the end of my presentation . # ME: I'm gonna pull this off . # ID: I think if you just give it a second to maybe catch up . # PM: I think she said twenty seconds to # ID: I'm sure we'll have by the end of today . # ME: I'll give it another go . # ME: we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . # ME: And first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the T_V_ and how do people use it ? # ME: We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them . # ME: how d how does a remote control look and feel for them , and what improvements would they like to remote control . # ME: And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers . # ME: And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s a fancier remote control And that of all the buttons on the remote control , the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture and brightness and the audio settings , they weren't used very often at all . # ME: People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons . # ME: we also asked them about speech recognition for remote control . # ME: And young people were quite receptive to this , but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older , people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition . # ME: There's a lot more th there's a lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well . # ME: we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it . # ME: And the second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it . # ME: Okay , so My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech A design which looks high-tech , basically . # ME: and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as Louisa said . # ME: we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control . # ME: That's worth thinking about . # ME: and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well , because sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design . # ME: That that might be the market that we're looking for . # ME: And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than sort of having it to speech recognition to change the channels . # ME: 'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise , so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel . # ME: and that's the end of the slide show . # PM: What was that last wee bit there ? # ME: about speech recognition ? # PM: Speech recognition , But that was only for young people that preferred it , older people didn't . # ME: Youn young people pref they s they said that they'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in sort of a remote control that you could talk to , so . # ID: No what I maybe think is it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for the speech recognition . # PM: Well that's right . # ID: And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have You know with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it . # ID: Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two . # ID: So you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is . # ME: we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well , # ID: That is true , yes . # ME: which again would probably be a bit expensive , but # UI: There's key rings that you kind of whistle at or clap at , I can't remember , and then they whistle back , or something like that . # PM: Sounds reasonable . # UI: That'd probably be really simple , they're cheap . # ID: So I guess it'd be something we could like attach to the or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote . # PM: Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition . # PM: But if you I was gonna say a sharp noise , you know a clapping of hand or whatever . # PM: You'd want to try and av just have the one product that if # ID: if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one device . # PM: I dunno talking about vo I mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it'll recognise the voice and you can give it a command , a set command whatever that happened to be . # PM: But you've then got the point if you're not going with voice recognition then # ID: you could have an option to turn it off . Or Perhaps , . # ID: So that would solve the problems with the T_V_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels . # PM: Any sugges Well , any conclusions ? # ME: would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ? # PM: Well if it does then we can't . # PM: It's that simple , because we've got th three primary requisites from and email that was sent to me whereby we had The design logo was one , which we've already mentioned . # PM: We've got the remote was only for the television and not for because that would make it too complex and we have to get it market quickly . # PM: And the third thing was that teletext as far as the management is concerned , is becoming dated due to the popularity of the internet . # PM: So that means that so these are the sort of three extra parameters that have been put on this project . # PM: So we're being focused effectively directly at a television and it seems to me that the management is wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out . # PM: So anything that is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick # ID: Has to be simple enough to # PM: because time to market is critical . S # ID: I suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes . # PM: But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras . # PM: Added extras would be nice , but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within this short time window , which effectively now is sort of four hours . # PM: So and if and we've gotta get to the end . # PM: d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with added extras if possible . # PM: Right okay , so I need to Right . So I don't know how long we have left of our time . # PM: But we have to make the decisions on the remote control functions # ME: About five minutes . # PM: and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next meeting each person that's got a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is . # PM: We'll also know w when the next meeting is I so we'll know how long we've got to complete that task . # PM: And then we can report back at the next meeting and say right okay yes , we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this , this is how far we've progressed . # PM: Does that make reasonable sense ? # ID: Yes that seems right . # PM: So we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you're gonna be doing . # PM: And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting . # PM: Do it via the email # PM: so that rather than coming you know If you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine . # PM: Come along with it in the next meeting , we can discuss it then and take whatever action is appropriate . # PM: But if you get it well before the next meeting , let everybody else know 'cause that might have an impact on their on what they come up with effectively at the next meeting . # PM: Right , is there # ME: So do we need to decide on the functions now ? S # PM: I would guess so . # UI: Well I think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of kind of whistle back kind of function . # UI: 'Cause that'll solve kind of the frustration of losing it . # ME: and that was that was the number one sort of frustration that people said , so . # ME: I don't think there's anything else on the market that does that , so . # UI: I don't really know about the voice recognition thing . # ID: Maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment , # PM: Something simple . # PM: if our primary consideration is to get it there in time , time's short , # ID: and if something comes back # PM: you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point for the product , something that's quick and simple . # UI: And that wouldn't put off the kind of older generation either , 'cause everyone can whistle or clap , and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology . # PM: Well , so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be On the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range , you want something that's easy to do , now something that doesn't like whis # ME: No not everyone can whistle , can they , though ? # PM: Well I don't know . # PM: Well If you think that more people can whistle than clap then that's fine , then go for that option , I would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle , # ME: clapping , I think clapping , # ID: f more for clap . # PM: so clap option . # UI: 'Kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button , haven't we ? # PM: Ef effectively that's what the that's what they're saying , # UI: Is that one of the # PM: that if people are now using the internet then you don't need teletext , so take out teletext . # ME: Taking out teletext , okay . # ID: Did we decide on having the ten the ten numbers and then the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together . # UI: , I think so , so zero to nine . # ME: I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number , so you can press any two and it'll sort of put them together . # ID: Okay , ten numbers and then some kind of device to allow I'll put delay to allow multiple numbers . # ID: Or multiple digits . # ID: Did we decide anything about the other functions ? # ID: As in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that ? # ID: You had an had an idea about the menu ? # ME: we could possibly put an L_ a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in , but that again is probably an expense that # ID: But just thinking people probably I mean you don't have you only have to probably tune in the T_V_ once , but you have to be able to tune it that once . # ID: So and if finally the T_V_ breaks , you get a new one , you're gonna have to be able to tune it . # ID: You can't really avoid that . # ID: Except the new digital markets which do it by themselves . # PM: But the but that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic # ID: So that'll be in # PM: and if it is at the moment , that's fine . # PM: But at the moment it's not , so it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters , 'cause otherwise it would make it your device would become inoperable , or only operable in certain circumstances and the idea is to have an international market which is And it's also m it's the product we've got is something that's at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale , so we're not really going for something that's terribly high-tech . # ME: I s I suppose if people are buying remotes , then they're probably buying it to replace another remote # ME: 'cause all most tellies come with remotes , so . # ME: I mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions , so we maybe need to keep the tuning function in . # ID: So how would this menu function work ? # ID: Would you maybe have like one menu button , then you'd use the other buttons , maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions . # UI: like the volume or something . # ME: that would be a good idea , . # UI: , 'cause you do need kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well . # UI: My dad was watching a film the other week and it was too dark , so I had to go through it and turn the brightness up . # ID: we're gonna have the individual numbers and then a menu function and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced instruction booklet to come with it , to guide I think it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp just off like the menu use different buttons you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work . # ME: I'm not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet 'cause one the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one . # ME: So maybe next to each of the buttons , you know each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it , so you're basically pressing # ID: that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two , and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and stuff which kind of looked too busy and had too much on it , so . # UI: Well , if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well , have you seen those remotes where kind of the bottom bit slides down , so there's kind of everything else revealed ? # PM: That's a very good idea . # UI: So you don't use it that much , you don't have to see it all the time . # UI: But it's all there if you need it . # ID: That is that is a good idea actually . # ID: Sor sort of a second . # UI: Like a hidden panel . # PM: Right we've got five minutes before we wind up this meeting , so I've been told . # PM: I don't know if you've got the same . # ID: not quite , but I guess . # PM: So so keep detailed functions hidden at the back . # ID: Keep the other buttons but hide them away . # UI: And that'll be better for the older generation as well 'cause , well my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu , but he can pretty much read a button if it's displayed properly . # ID: So we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as well . # ID: So we're gonna have like two separate two separate lists , I guess . # PM: data functions hidden at back . # PM: Can bring out when needed . # ME: So th the The detailed ones would be sort of brightness , # PM: That's right so we're dis So you've got which ones are gonna be on the front and which ones are gonna be on the back . # PM: We have to decide . # ID: Should we decide in the next couple of minutes , and then # ID: about the number . # ID: the volume up and down . # UI: And the volume ? # ID: Shall we have a mute button as well ? # ID: A mute button as well . # UI: I think they're handy . # ME: And probably a power one as well . # UI: I know it's probably like not an issue to raise here , but the whole thing about not using your standby because of the like waste of electricity . # UI: Have you seen the adverts ? # UI: Like if you boil the kettle that's full that's a waste . # UI: If you leave your telly on standby it powers Blackpool for a certain amount of time . # UI: Like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby . # ID: But then they might not buy it if they haven't got one . # ID: 'Cause people might just be too fickle and not want to change . # UI: , it's maybe too much of a big issue for here . # PM: So so are you having the stand-by on the front , then ? # ID: We can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand-by . # UI: Uh-oh danger sign . # ID: I think you probably should . # UI: but a little bit smaller . # ID: are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons ? # ME: 'cause the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , so . # ID: Okay , so we'll have So we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ? # PM: Channel up and down . # PM: What else have we got ? # PM: What was that , sixteen ? # ME: Numbers is ten , volume is twelve , # PM: Volume button . How many volumes ? # ME: One up , one down . # ME: That's sixteen isn't it , . # ID: Is there anything else ? # ME: I don't think so , no . # PM: Power button , stand-by , channel , up and down . # PM: That's sixteen buttons , you reckon . # PM: And then at the back ? # ME: You've got brightness and contrast . # ID: Maybe if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be . # PM: So on the back it'll have brightness , contrast , anything else ? # PM: You're also gonna have the channel tuner , as it were . # UI: there's audio functions . # ID: So tuner up and down , I guess . # PM: Tuner , would that have up and down ? . # ID: up Tune one way , tune the o # UI: I think they normally do . # ID: I dunno I dunno possibly . # ME: And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in . # ME: So you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it , . # ID: and th and a enter button just to select . # ID: I guess we're keeping s it simple . # ID: We don't really need any other audio funct functions because it's just volume up , volume down . # PM: up volume , I would have thought so . # UI: So I think there's quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio , surround sort of things . # ID: Do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products , then , # UI: maybe for the younger market . # ID: or do you have to do it via the remote ? # UI: I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel . # ID: I suppose if we've got their if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple . # UI: Oh no , I mean like there's kind of individual buttons for them , like on the T_V_ remote . # UI: But I don't really know what they're for , I've never used them . # UI: I just know they're something to do with Dolby . # ID: Maybe unless something comes up then we should I think # PM: Well you might get some research . # ID: Well shall we look into that and just get back together . # PM: Right so I'll do the minutes of this meeting . # PM: And we'll meet back at I'm not sure . # PM: forty minutes , I believe is the time .
# PM: Conceptual design meeting . # PM: Right . Okay , so Right well from the last meeting I was trying to send you the minutes , but it didn't work out too well , so maybe in sort of quick summary of the last meeting , I can quickly give you what we what we had . # PM: right , so Wishing I hadn't closed the damn Right so we had the fact that we're gonna have the logo the company logo in its colour scheme incorporated onto the device the remote device . # PM: We had made our decisions about made our decisions about the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it enable us to complete the project in time . # PM: We're gonna have effectively two pages , a front page which had the features that the customers most wanted , and then the backup features on the second page so that it could meet the technical requirements . # PM: And the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , only as and when required . # PM: So basically what decisions have we made ? # PM: have there been any changes ? # ID: I think we all have a presentation again , so if we go through those and then # PM: Three presentation , . # ID: Shall I go first again ? # ID: I see this a little more smoothly than the last one . # ID: Okay right , let's get started . # ID: basically the for the I'll back actually . # ID: For the components design , next step is basically the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . # ID: We still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate . # ID: Then there is a chip and still the sender . # ID: So yes including the power s supply as well . # ID: I'll go on to my findings in each of these areas . # ID: first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , There's a dynamo . # ID: Any of you think of kind of like the old torches which you wind up There's a kinetic option , which if any of you've seen those new watches which you kind of you power up by waving around , it just requires a small amount of movement which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced . # ID: that's one option , but I think that was gonna cost a little more . # ID: And then there's solar cells . as a final option . # ID: For the buttons , we have an integrated push button , which is Oh just to say all these are supplied by Real Reaction . # ID: So I guess for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options . # ID: so for the buttons there's an integrated push button , which I guess is just the same as the standard ones . # ID: This says it's similar to the button on the mouse for a normal for like modern computer . # ID: there's a scroll wheel which is you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down , which may be for the volume . # ID: You could do that . # ID: one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use , if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case , so we have to take that into consideration . # ID: moving on to the printed s # PM: What would be the cost do we know ? # ID: that's on the next I th I think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost , that related to the actual buttons , but it does affect the printed circuit board . # ID: which is the next section . # ID: Basically for the circuit board which is the middle , it's just see it down there the chips like the like the workings of the actual of the remote . # ID: The firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced circuit board . # ID: And there's different prices according to each . # ID: So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard push button . # ID: one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition . # ID: There's a small unit available through the company which obviously would be an extra cost , but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much . # ID: and I guess that would require a more advanced circuit board , so there is an extra price in that sense . # ID: There is th sorry an extra cost in that sense . # ID: going to my personal preferences , I thought possibly for power we could use kinetic which is the idea of the watches that you move you move the remote around to power it up . # ID: And this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like . # ID: for the buttons , I thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard push buttons rather than the scroll wheel . # ID: and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote . # ID: So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , then we'd have to get a more costly circuit board . # PM: with the printed circuit boards you were going for the # ID: i it kind of depends if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one . I'm guessing . # ID: but I don't know , so that is something I'll have to look into . # PM: But are we going f R # ID: that's a that's a decision for all of us . # PM: So are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue , # PM: so would it not be best to rather than I mean one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were . # PM: The other way would be to do the presentation and then make the decision at that point in time . # UI: that's probably a better one , to discuss it straight away . # PM: 'Cause at that point then you've got the details up there , so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance . Then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time and then that would be the end of that issue . # PM: Does that make sense ? # UI: I have a lot of the information there . # UI: It might not be very clear . # UI: Unless you want to plug it back in to yours . # ID: As I say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel , it didn't The voice recognition came as a separate piece of information . # PM: the scroll wheel required the regular , # ID: if you down . It's just this bit at the bottom which I've highlighted , but the scroll wheel requires a mini m minimally a regular chip , which is in the higher price range . # PM: The display requires an advanced chip # UI: I think the scroll wheel # PM: the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense . # ID: Also the display's for something else which we decided against . # ID: but that bit And note that the push button just requires a simple chip , so that would keep the price down . # UI: , and if we're going for sleek and sexy , I think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky ? # UI: I I've got pictures well I've seen pictures with it kind of sticking off the side of it , # UI: and they don't really look great . # ID: So maybe just a simple push button , and that would cut costs on the # PM: So . So we're going for p Okay . # ME: So are we going for the w are we going for the simple one , are we ? # UI: , a simple pushbuttons . # PM: Simple push button . # ID: Did everyone get this on the speech recognition ? # ID: it was basically what we said before , the idea that you record in a set message , and then it picks up that message and replies to you . # ID: So it is basically the concept we discussed before . # ID: but then we don't know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board . # ID: I'm guessing it would , but got like the definite information . # ID: Maybe we should go on what we're certain of rather than # PM: So if we go for the simple push button , so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we ? # PM: Or are we going for the regular ? # ID: if it's just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board . # PM: But is there any other I mean okay , that's true for the for that element , but we have to take all el elements into consideration . # PM: And so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one , or say the regular one , or the more advanced , then that would have to be the same for all of them . S # ME: I suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires , maybe before we m make a decision . # UI: But the way that I interpret that it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly , it just it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message . # ME: Oh , I suppose so , . # ID: So maybe that would be something separate , . # UI: So I don't think it would effect our circuit board . # ID: so we'd have a simple circuit board and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it . # ID: Oh that makes sense . # UI: And I don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it . # UI: 'Cause the example that they've given there is good morning coffee machine , good morning Jo . # UI: It might be useful to say like where are you remote . Here I am , Jo . # UI: But I think that's maybe as far as that one could go ? # ID: that makes sense , so we'd stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra an extra possibility . # UI: just as a fun way to find it . # PM: Simple circuit board . # PM: Simple push button . # UI: And it says that # PM: You were you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply . # UI: I think it said the cost of that isn't too much . # ID: I thought so just for just for ease of not having to replace the batteries . # PM: And how does it get charged up ? # ID: It's I think it works on the basis they have some kind of ball bearings inside . # ID: It's it's some on watches which you kind of you shake to power it up . # ID: Somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement . # ID: So you'd move the remote around a little bit and then that powers it up to use it . # PM: So the speech recognition was Are we going for speech recognition ? # PM: 'Cause that required the advanced # UI: I think it would be helpful to find it , but I don't think it'd # ID: I think did we decide it didn't affect the circuit board , it just affected # ME: Just just for the call and find thing . # PM: I had speech recognition requires advanced req require # ID: th that's what that's what I thought , but maybe it doesn't . # ID: I think I might have got that wrong . # ME: 'Cause it's s it's separate isn't it , # PM: Speech recognition you reckon then is s simple . # ME: it's not part of the # ID: It's it's just an addition thing # PM: And so we would want it in as an extra because it doesn't appear to cost too much . # PM: Would that be # ID: 'Kay shall I pass on to you now ? # PM: In fact , it wouldn't really cost anymore , would it ? # UI: I'll just check what it said . # UI: Actually I don't think it really says anything about the cost , but it says that it's already in the coffee machines , so like it's already kind of # ID: I assume it would cost extra , but Maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later . # PM: And then have to change all change everything at the last minute . # UI: Oh , that was quick . # UI: okay , so very brief presentation , . # UI: From looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute , none of them are particularly sleek and sexy . # UI: I haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there , but there's some curved cases that you can see , a range of sizes . # UI: All of them have a lot of buttons there they seem to just have the rubber buttons . # UI: Does that move it ? # UI: It just seems to be skipping on without us doing anything . # PM: I've found that try and get it back . # ID: If you right click and then go onto a previous slide . # UI: There wasn't much more to say about that , just rambling . # UI: some of the remotes that I looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could where it was connected to the remote control functions . # UI: And it was quite a swish model , where it can control four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , video , D_V_D_ , audio . # UI: so that's a bit of competition there . # UI: I mean maybe it's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing and just to market it as a completely different like different viewpoint as a kind of finding your lost control rather than trying to compete with the functions . # UI: the scroll buttons , as you've already mentioned , there's examples of those , but they don't look as sleek as other models . # UI: And there's no real advantage and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it's not great . # PM: So you were saying the scroll buttons # UI: Th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about , . # UI: There was children's remote , where they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b bright and colourful and you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels . # UI: but I don't know if that's really in our field ? # ID: I guess I guess we're going for the biggest market , maybe not , # UI: But that's something that's out there . # ID: but Was it was it specified that we went for the biggest ? # PM: Well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market but that wouldn't necessarily preclude The one thing that you can often do with products is you can make small modifications . # PM: So you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever , and then you could have additional features in you know like a You'd have model one , model two and model three , and therefore you can sub-divide your market up . # PM: But that's really where your field is . # ID: So maybe the children's remote should be like a next step , but maybe I dunno for ours , maybe we should # PM: Anyway you could add on for an extra package , but on this basic one I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments . # UI: Right well that's something that we can be aware of . # PM: So so what are we deciding to do here ? # UI: I think because there's already very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be a good idea to market it as a finder function . # PM: the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote . # ID: So you also said for going for the international market that some maybe older people might not like the speech recognition . # UI: Different languages might not be compatible . # ID: It w it would make it quite complicated , where ours at least keeps it fairly simple and then the # UI: , 'cause I think you program this one yourself , like to say like whatever you want to your question . # ME: and ours is quite a cheap device , so I don't know how much we'll be able to put into it . # PM: So you'd have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature . # PM: And you were talking # UI: unless something else comes up . # PM: And you were talking about scroll buttons ? # UI: I think I think we've decided that it's gonna increase the cost and give no real kinda extra benefit and it's gonna decrease from the sleekness of it . # PM: Alright , so we're just gonna have the rubber buttons , was that right ? # UI: and just to be aware that there are kind of specialist functions and specialist remotes but we probably don't want to focus on those like such as the children's remote . # PM: Okay . So not to be focused on . # UI: there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design . # UI: just to avoid ambiguity . # UI: So it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down , they might both have a V_ on for volume , let's think how they did this . # PM: Good in Flip it round in ninety degree a hundred and eighty degrees and have it up and down . # UI: I'm just gonna check so I do this right . # PM: An upside-down V_ . # PM: So that would show that volume was going up , whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down . # UI: . What did they say ? # UI: I think the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up , and that's the first thing that they see Actually that can't be right , can it ? # UI: Oh well , no , they might see , they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down , whereas the actual button's pointing up , so the function is to turn the button up . # UI: So , be careful what you put on the buttons # ID: So maybe we could have like # UI: and be careful of the shape that you make them , because they might be kind of two contradicting kind of shapes . # ID: I know what you mean . # ID: So maybe we could have volume written on the side and then up and down on the on the buttons themselves . # PM: You could have volume up and volume # PM: Volume up , down and Like that . # PM: And 'cause the idea was to have limited it was to have sizable amount of information on it . # PM: Limited number of buttons . # PM: 'Cause it was sixteen buttons , wasn't it that were # ID: we got it down to not too many . # UI: and I think that's all I had to say for that . # UI: so what was the decision on the design of the volume button ? # ID: Are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment , or are we gonna t # ME: I've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching . # ID: , maybe we should see yours first . # ME: Right , I've been looking at some trends in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the research into the remote control market the one that's the one I talked about last time , that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what was good about them , what was bad , what they used . # ME: And we've also been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment . # ME: So we've had people in Paris and Milan watching the fashion trends . # PM: You know yourself . # ME: So just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation . # ME: The most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional . # ME: And second , there should be some technological innovation . # ME: And then third and l less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as well . # ME: And apparently , the fashion trends are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme . # ME: but the feel of the material should be spongy , which is contrary to last year , apparently . # ME: I presume it must have been not spongy last year . # ME: we need to emphasise the fancy design with on our remote control above all else . # ME: And then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap . # ME: And then we need to ma sort of make it easy to use that's as a third priority , so perhaps fewer buttons and functions as we've as we've discussed . # ME: And then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations . # ME: So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg , or the buttons could be spongy , somehow . # ME: Maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic . # ME: And then sort of even wackier than that , we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote , say in the shape of a banana or something like that . # ME: Right , so that'll be it . # ME: Maybe a banana or courgette or something . # ME: How how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends , do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget , or you know , do they not matter that much ? # UI: I think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use . # PM: Well you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons , 'cause you're can mis-direct people . # PM: And I would've thought the functionality 'cause the people get cheesed off by things by having to read instructions et cetera , so . # UI: Maybe just one button , say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions . # UI: Maybe that could be a little apple . # UI: And then that wouldn't get in the way of like kinda one to nine , and it wouldn't confuse the numbers . # PM: Stand-by button . # PM: th that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people , if you're looking for functionality . # ID: Well I dunno I guess maybe fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment , but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are , # PM: But what are they gonna be next What are they gonna be next year . # PM: But but th but okay but you can incorporate the tr If y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg , next year's I was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever . # PM: That means you're constantly changing your production schedule , and you've gotta make different moulds and everything else , so that's not a good idea I would I would suggest . # ME: I'm not I'm not sure what the sort of timescale we're thinking of selling the product over is . # ID: I mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends . # ID: to something which is maybe more universal . # UI: But I suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design , even if the design kind of changes , # ID: We c maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly . # ID: Maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about , . # ID: Maybe still with a rubber design we could # PM: Was that in the sort of fashion sense that this Or was the spongy feel was that sort of fashion ? # PM: It was , wasn't it ? # UI: It seems like you're gonna have rubber cases , as well as buttons . # UI: And that you can make them curved or double-curved and that would be the kind of sleek and sexy look . # ID: Oh yeah one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have a rubber case . # UI: Oh right , that fits , doesn't it ? # ID: it's if you use the rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons . # ID: That's the way round . # ID: If you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it . # ID: Which makes sense . # PM: Rubber buttons require rubber case . # UI: And that would fit in with what we want , wouldn't it , for the spongy feel , to have everything rubber . # PM: The m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change ? # PM: 'Cause in essence in the production you want things to stay you want to basically mint them out 'cause if you've got fashion changes and that you're incorporating , then it means that your stock is last year's stock and therefore you're selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate which you wouldn't want to do . # PM: Whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year , it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like , rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle . # PM: You're just changing one aspect like the standby button or something like that , and especially 'cause then you could make it something that # ID: I suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual # PM: Well , you might be limited in space , that yes . # PM: Well you two are obviously gonna find that out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to how much pl how much how much how pliable is Plasticine . # ID: Maybe we could think of the cases like changing with the fashions like the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside . # ID: But whether that would be too much to incorporate in production , whether that would just increase the costs , make it more complicated . # PM: So you're talking there about changing the casing . # ME: That's possibly it . # ID: the a the actual the sort of the look from the outside , so where the buttons would stay the same , and the general function of the remote would stay the same , but you could change the way it looked . # UI: and then you could have Oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case , # UI: but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that . # PM: you could do a colour change , so therefore you would I mean that's effectively what they did with the with the mobile phones , was to have some in blue , some in red , some in rather than all in black or , you know , which four do you want , as long as it's black ? # ID: So it is a possibility , . # UI: But we are supposed to use the company colour scheme , aren't we ? # PM: Yes oh that's true # UI: We haven't really seen that yet # PM: that might no # UI: It might and we might be able to do both but it might clash with certain things . # PM: Well not necessarily , because you could have your company We're we're meant to be finishing up . # PM: You could have your company badge and logo . # PM: I mean a lot of computers for instance like on the one you've got there , it actually has a sort of stick on badge so what you would al all you would really need , whether it , you know , whether the casing be w any colour , could be any colour , but that badge would then have to stick out on top of it so that in a sense , with a with a logo like that , because it's on a white background , the only colour that it might not stick out so well on would be a white casing . # PM: 'Cause you know you're sort of you're badging it . # PM: And in fact a lot of companies get somebody else to make them and literally just badge them themselves with their own badge over the top . # PM: And in fact the way they've got that there even if you had that on a white , which is the predominant colour of the Windows badge , you'd still be able to see it clearly from you know a white casing product . # ID: And whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider . # UI: Well if it's for young people , like the phone generation , that sort of thing'd probably go down well , and the market research has been on that side of things , hasn't it ? # ME: I mean it's people say that it's the look , they want the fancy looking thing I'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into . # ME: I think with the mobiles , it's the , you know it's a communication device , people see you with it all about and # ID: I suppose , where you keep the remote hidden under the sofa most of the time . # PM: It's in the house , isn't it , I suppose . # UI: Okay , so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case # PM: So don't change case . # PM: Change case colour . # PM: And we're sort of saying no to that . # UI: Did we decide on the rubber case ? # UI: The spongy feel , or did we think that might go as a trend ? # ME: Well , it was different last year . # ME: The trend was different last year apparently . # ME: It was not spongy feel . # ME: I don't know whether the trend will change . # ME: I don't know whether it's one of those things that like sort of having all fruit shaped keys , that probably would go out of fashion very quickly , whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a year , you know . # ID: , less likely to # PM: Sounds reasonable . # PM: If you're going for fashion trends like that they'll need t you'd have to have interchangeable cases # ID: So then th that would # PM: so that you could or 'cause otherwise someone's gonna have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case . # ID: it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case , and then have the standard rubber buttons as well . # UI: we haven't really talked about the curvature of the case . # UI: There's flat , there's single-curved and there's double-curved . # UI: I'm not exactly sure what these things look like . # ID: Maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel ? # ID: But the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the Plasticine . # UI: Well it says that # ME: When you say d when you say double-curved , what exactly does that mean ? # UI: I'm not exactly sure . # UI: I'll show you the remotes that I've got . # UI: See how Let's just get that bigger . # UI: See how the one Oh I'm not plugged in , am I ? # ME: you're not connected to me anymore . # UI: That doesn't help . # PM: One one thing to cons # UI: Shall I just turn it round for time ? # PM: one thing to consider is that in some ways you want by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other # ME: That should come up . # PM: therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can if you can store them up on top of each other . # PM: Whereas if you do fancy things with it , you then gotta put it in a ca a packaging box that does that . # PM: And the cost of packaging could be quite important vis-a-vis the total cost of the product . # ID: So shall we go through quickly and just work out what we've decide on , if we have to kind of # UI: it's not very clear up there , but you can see some of them have got kind of bulges , like the second one and the end one where there's a curve there . # UI: I'm not exactl I don't know if a double curve is maybe it comes up slightly , or ? # ME: That's what I was trying to work out . # UI: But it is a kinda sleeker look if you've got curves in there . # PM: S so do you wanna go for curves , more curves ? # PM: We're meant to be f we're meant to be finishing this meeting in about a minute or so . # UI: Definitely a single , maybe a double . # ID: so shall we quickly # UI: Shall we go for single curve , just to compromise ? # ID: We'll go for single curve , . # ID: Single curve . # PM: curved or double curved ? So it's single curved . # ID: So did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply ? # ID: The one you move around ? # ME: I think that think that's a good idea . # UI: And the rubber push buttons , rubber case . # ME: Rubber buttons and case . # UI: and we don't really know much about the colour scheme or logo yet do we , # UI: but possibly a sticker . # ID: we'll still have the Are we gonna go for the simple circuit board just to keep the cost down ? # ID: I th I think we can by not having anything too complicated . # UI: and the voice recognition , we can use that can't we , just to find it . Without affecting the circuit board . # ID: And see we could always decide against it if something comes up that's just something to that we seemed to leave out . # ME: And then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit . Or veg . # UI: that sounds like it wouldn't do too much harm in a couple of years . # UI: what sort of shape do we want ? # PM: So we've got spongy feel buttons as well , have we ? # ME: Don't know , maybe just # PM: As well as or w or was that # ME: That's ru rubber buttons , . # PM: So it's rubber buttons , # PM: so it's not really spongy feel buttons , it's just rubber buttons . # PM: With a rubber case right ? # UI: so it's not too wacky . # ME: Reasonably spongy I guess , . # PM: And the standby button is gonna be different . # UI: I think an apple would be a good recognisable shape . # UI: If you start getting into kinda aubergines and things , it gets a bit weird . # PM: Okay so what shape are we making the standby button ? # UI: Shall we vote on it ? # ID: We will go for the a apples . # UI: Anyone got any suggestions ? # ME: Apple apple a qu Quite a big one , as well . # UI: Well it could be red . # ME: Could be a red apple , . # ME: Either , don't mind . # UI: 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can , once we find out # ID: And then we're gonna are you gonna work on keeping the button design quite simple ? # ID: Just like the Just working out what we're gonna do for the next time . # UI: that seems pretty straight forward . # UI: 'Cause most of them will just be kind of mainly circular or like very plain . # PM: what was that last thing again there ? # UI: just to keep the shape of the buttons simple . # PM: Right much option on that . # PM: I thought you were going for a single curve and # UI: just the shape of the buttons . # ID: And j , just keeping the sort of the labelling them labelling of them fairly simple as well . # ID: Fairly sort of self explanatory . # PM: Right , so shape of buttons simple . # PM: So that's that , I guess . # PM: We should now go away and get these things sorted out . # PM: I guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever . # ID: Is that the end ? # ME: Looks like it .
# PM: Why not save that . # ME: No , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere . # PM: Do you want to replace existing file , no . # PM: I actually tried to transfer it to My Documents , but # ME: , you have to you have to close that window . # ME: 'Cause that's the save one isn't it , so And then find it . # PM: spreadsheet . # PM: , but I've ta right , I'll just re-do it . # PM: That's the easiest way . # UI: Well we've made our prototype anyway . # UI: We can have a good look at that . # ME: You pass it round to have a look . # UI: Y no , it's a slightly curved around the sides . # UI: , it's almost curved like up to the main display as well . # UI: And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down . # UI: And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . # UI: And we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on . # ID: We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top . # ME: Cherry would be alright actually . # UI: it's a bit more fun , isn't it ? # UI: And it's kinda not really at a kind of you think apple , you think computers , like Apple Mac . # ID: we might get a # ME: What's this one ? # UI: , and cherries are fun , summery . # ME: What's that one there ? # UI: , that's the mute . # ME: Oh , okay . Right . # UI: It it'd probably have to be labelled mute . # ID: They're thinking # UI: But , we didn't have anything small enough to write . # ID: For the first time , well it was hard to get the h the actual labelling on the individual buttons . # UI: , we just chose simple shapes for all them . # UI: , the important ones are the volume ones . # UI: So we made them a bit bigger . # UI: The mute could possibly be a bit smaller . # ID: Hum , you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you've got the volume in orange on design there , and the channel is in blue . # UI: , and we chose a V_ plus and V_ minus . # PM: all these things have cost implications . # PM: And so when I done my thing on cost a I had assumed that the only button that would be a different colour would be the red apple button . # PM: So However , I've now . But , so but there would be a cost implication on that , # ME: I'll see if I can find them . # PM: and as I suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours , would be open to debate , I suppose . # UI: Well the colours wouldn't like that's they wouldn't be too important , but we didn't have any white Play-Doh . # UI: So that's where the colour buttons came from . # PM: An important consideration . # PM: Right , okay so And the second one underneath would be the idea for the # ID: Yes , we'll have the slide-away . # PM: So we've got detail design meeting . # PM: So , we've got prototype presentation , which we've just done , evaluation criteria , and finance , so I guess w we have to evaluate if that meets the various aspects that we're looking for from our previous meeting . # PM: So other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer , but obviously it would . # PM: But other than that , we got the red apple . # PM: We got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the is the colouration of the buttons , # PM: and the bit after the evaluation criteria is the finance . And the and the cost implication . # PM: The only snag about this is that the cost is probably kind of important . # PM: So , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to manufacture . # PM: , and whether it would # ME: So if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype ? # ID: This this is a # ID: this is our presentation of the prototype . # PM: Right , so as far as the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first considerations was to be in d under twelve fifty or two and a half twelve and a half Euros . # PM: So , there's no redesign . # PM: So that should Right , so , seems to me that the thing that I have to do is quickly find that # ID: Could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there ? # ME: we should plug it in . # ME: Do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the back of that one . # ME: We could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype . # ID: 'Kay this should be then . # PM: Okay , so , by the fact that we've got the simple chip and the kinetic energy source , we've got a single curved case . We've got a rubber case materials supplements . # PM: So , we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and # ID: Have a push button interface . # PM: Okay . W the button supplements . # PM: Well , originally , I thought there would just be one in there because it was the one red apple . # PM: So the so the real w the real question then would come in . # PM: Do you make all the buttons # ME: Well do we'll do it on the prototype , so do two , see how much it is . # PM: Well , so we've got one special button form , which was the apple . # PM: Everything else is gonna be a standard . # PM: We've got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that , # ID: And then we'd have # PM: so , I was originally , I was thinking rubber wasn't special , but according to this , maybe it is . # PM: And the r I mean effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there . # ME: I think you just do one , don't you , for the # PM: W I don't know is the sort of answer , is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , and therefore I mean , what's the op The option was maybe not to have rubber buttons , but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , and therefore # ME: I think I think it's just it's just a one . Else # PM: Whereas it would be the special colour would be for the So you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic . # ME: I thi I think I think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material , rather than per button . # ME: I don't know though . # PM: I would Every design change is sound] I dunno , if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , I guess . # PM: We'd have one special colour and one special button form . # PM: And when I plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half . As far as I know , that took care of the of the various supplements . # PM: What happened ? # ME: You've just gone off the window into another one . # ME: It's on the bottom row . # UI: Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box . # PM: Okay , so , but the point would be that if we if we just did special you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there . # ID: So that's nine point one there so we've got some # PM: Well , is it s is it's nine point seven I've got . # ID: Just give us a bit of # PM: So , that would that would work out fine if uh as assuming your correction are assuming that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine . # PM: And there's nothing else as far as I can see that we had planned to put on . # ID: I switching around those th on the electronics we got the sample sensor . # ID: At the moment we've just got the simple chip , which costs one . # ID: , I guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ? # ID: We should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech # PM: Okay , that gives us twelve point seven # ID: So maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition # PM: But remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the # PM: Oh , I see , so just take out the special colour for the apple and # UI: wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as well ? # UI: You know how you turn that one to a zero , wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things , # ME: we have to have it # ID: Oh possibly , maybe . # UI: so you need both of them ? # ID: Maybe we'd be giving up on the kinetic . # PM: And go for battery instead . # PM: That would give you one less . # ID: We should that would save us one , though we'd still be slightly ov # PM: But you reckon that i I mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries . # ID: Well , since it's the through the whole technology type thing , you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them . # ID: , whether they would figure the s sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have . # ID: And then still have the batteries , or whatever they would prefer not You know what I mean ? # ID: The the problem was the battery's running out and losing the losing the remote . # ID: So you gotta decide which of those is more important to them . # PM: But which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options ? # PM: In a sense , at the moment , we've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two . # UI: I think the voice recognition . # PM: Remember that was a minimum requirement . # PM: The other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to make it originally , we're gonna make it a simple product . # ME: Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first , and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ? # ME: Okay . Right , I have a little thing . # ME: So , we've all got a note of it's thirteen point seven , isn't it , with everything we want on . # PM: do you want that back up ? # ME: I just had a presentation to do . # UI: But I do think the v voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery . # PM: but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost . # ME: Right okay , This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the prototype we've got here . # ME: And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated . # ME: And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research , and also finance , I guess . # ME: And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it's neither true nor false , then that's four . # ME: So , I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end . # ME: so , We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . # ME: The whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . # ME: Whether it's easy to use . # ME: Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer . # ME: And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product . # ME: And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently , so I'll go over here . # ME: So the first one is , does the product look and feel fancy . # ME: So if we do a sort of a one # ID: Okay , well we have a single curve , which was maybe like the feel of the product's quite good . # ID: , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time . # ID: , sorry that'd be considered fancy . # UI: , I'd maybe give it a two . # ME: Of but I think What Is one false , or is t one true ? # ME: One's true , and okay . Seven's fal # UI: And a four is neutral . # ME: Four is neutral , okay . # ID: So maybe a two . # UI: 'cause we haven't got the double curve , so we can't like say it's completely true . # PM: Go for one . Yep . # UI: But it's pretty close . # UI: We've got almost everything we can . # ME: I gonna put underneath so I've got some more space . # ME: So , false is seven , true is one , and So say about a two for fancy , you think ? # PM: , why not , m maybe nearer three . # ME: Okay , well d you do an average at the end , I don't know . # PM: Well , it's just that saying something remember that when you look down , we've got solar power , we've got various other things you could have , and we're not going for these options . # ME: This this is just this is just for like the look . # ME: Does it sort of look fancy rather than functional . So # UI: , I suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit . # ME: so that so sh should we go for a two on that ? # ME: And I mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ? # ID: , deciding between the kinetic power or the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition . # ME: So , what about the pr The prototype as it is , we've got we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we . # ID: But not the kinetic . # ME: But not the kinetic . # ID: Like the power . # PM: 'Cause you can't afford that w we took that out too . # ID: we can't afford both . # ME: So it doesn't It's pretty The prototype as it is isn't sort of fulfilling the # ID: may is maybe about neutral # UI: Maybe a three . # ID: plus it it's got something , but it hasn't got # PM: Well , wait a minute . # PM: In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic . # UI: I would give it more than a four . # PM: The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five . # PM: And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . # PM: So , it's very much dependant on what you do with your options . # PM: And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then because that # PM: the other functions we've got in are more at the The special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six , whereas down at just special colours is point two . # PM: Now you're trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors speaker , you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else . # PM: And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your sample sensor speaker , and then you're looking to take out point two , # ME: I'm just gonna check my email . # PM: which would be come from the button supplements category . # ME: I'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for the product . # UI: How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? # UI: Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much . # UI: If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough . # PM: interface type , # UI: And then it stand the test of time better . # PM: well plastic rather than rubber . # PM: That that would make the significant difference . # PM: You could either you could have it If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you'd be looking to take out point two . # PM: So you could fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom . # PM: And that would enable you to do it . # ID: So it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so # ME: , I just read the email again and it sort of says it's evaluate the design sort of as it is , I think , so I think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design . # ME: I don't know whether we're doing it in the wrong order or something or . # PM: Well , okay , but # UI: Well , I suppose it's rubber as it is , isn't it . # PM: It's rubber as it is , yes . # ME: So , I mean does this need to go up a bit or something , 'cause we've got both the both the speech # PM: We got we've got thirteen point seven and we've got it in at the moment and if and basically , we're going to reduce down from that . # PM: But the current one , you'd say would be fancy , would be too # ME: . , for innovation , so we've got the speech the speech thing , and # PM: I would've said about a two as well . # ME: Do you reckon a two ? # UI: I'd be happy with a two . # ME: And the next one is I'll have to get it back up now . # PM: The next on Well , I can just sing about . # PM: I would've said yes . # PM: I would go for a one on that at this point in time . # UI: I would say so as well . # PM: , incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . # PM: Well , it certainly has some . # UI: it's got the cherry and the sponginess . # ME: Say about a three maybe ? # ID: it was just doing it quite well . # ID: , I think we're gonna have to lose some of these , but the moment , as it stands , it's # PM: I woulda said two would seem reasonable . # PM: The product is a recognisable real r reaction product ? # ID: the sensor using all of its all of its products , all of its buttons , and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from . # UI: that's a bit rough at the minute . # ME: So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing , as well as having the logo on and all that . # ME: So sort of Is it sort of a recognisable product . # ME: Does it fit in with our other products , which are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft . # UI: , well it's got the same speech feature as the coffee machine . # ID: Also it's kind of spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age . # ID: , it depends which way you look at it . # PM: So we're going for a two , # ID: Maybe a kind of three ? # UI: Well , the logo would be more recognisable on the actual thing . # UI: It's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper . # UI: But , I think the logo would definitely be recognisable . # UI: And it does have attributes that other products do . # PM: Right , come on . # PM: That's that decided . # PM: Right . So we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , and then # UI: What does what do all them numbers mean then ? # UI: Do we add them up and rate or anything ? # ME: I think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be I'm just gonna do this in my head . # ME: One point eight isn't it or something . # ME: I think , anyway . # ME: So , pretty close to a two . # ME: So it's I mean it's pretty good at the moment , but it's gonna get worse , isn't it . # ME: But we've gotta try and make sure it doesn't get too bad . # PM: Two b two b two , . # ID: So should we get So are definite Was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has . # ID: Okay , so we need to # PM: Well , you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements . # ME: Do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the finances # PM: Okay , well I put it back on . # ID: So I guess this Is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ? # UI: we'll probably have to re-rate it . # PM: Yes , I would've thought so . # ID: we'll make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going . # PM: Okay , so what was it , control F_ eight , wasn't it ? # ME: it's come on already . # PM: Oh . Oh . How kind . # PM: Right , okay . So , you can see there that the If you want to keep kinetic , right , you've got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . # PM: You've got the sample sensor and sample speaker , which is your big item . # ID: Oh actually we just have a plastic case , then we lose two points , # ID: which gets us In right within the budget range . # PM: Which gets you # UI: , I think that'd be fine . # UI: Because that was just a trend , and we do have rubber buttons anyway . # ID: So that's eleven point seven , and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements . # ME: Different different colours , . # ME: , I was I was thinking that because maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case . # ID: And that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . # ID: So we'd lose a little bit on the maybe kind of # PM: So we're going for plastic , yes ? # ME: Lose a little bit on the fashion , but # ID: Oh , and that would now be # ID: , that's within the budget . # ID: Do we actually have Do we just have one special forms down here ? # PM: Well , w there was debate as to how you would count them . # PM: You got special colour . # PM: Well originally I was assuming we had the red apple , and therefore , that was the special colour . # ID: And we we've got we've got enough for another # UI: , I think we should just imagine white buttons . # ID: we've got nought point eight left , so we've got enough for another # PM: Well , we've got special form . # PM: Now that would be one button , and the question was that all buttons or is that just one button . # PM: 'Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special So so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same . # ID: But the but the # PM: The other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium . # ID: I think maybe the special colour , we've got three now just because the volume buttons are different , I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would just be the standard colour . # PM: So , special colour , you want three in there . # ID: which I think we should they'll still be fine for the for the price . # ME: Well I thin I think you just need two for the special colour 'cause it's just two supplements , you know . # ME: One original colour and then sort of two supplements , I think maybe . # PM: That makes sense . # ID: Okay , that's probably it . # ME: So we only ne we only need two for that . # ME: 'Cause I mean these are moulded . # ME: The one colour's gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas of rubber , isn't it . # PM: Okay . , I would agree with that , I think . # PM: And we've got special form is the one apple . # PM: The rest are all standard , although you could argue that should maybe be You were making these buttons down the bottom , I was presuming , bigger than the other ones , or were you ? # PM: Was that the idea ? # UI: the volume ones should stand out a bit . # ID: Maybe that'll be a second supplement . # ID: Then there's a spe a second special form . # PM: I would have thought that's probably about r well . # ID: Well you got you got twelve . # ID: So I think that should still be okay . # ID: , that's twelve point three , so we're still within budget on that . # PM: Yep , that makes sense . # ID: So decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it , but generally speaking , we've kept the other attributes to the # PM: I woulda said so . # PM: So you'd maybe put fash fan fashion at three rather than two . # ID: That's without # ME: So shall we do a Well , # ID: And specially it definitely could fits the real product What was the what's the company name ? # PM: Real Reaction produ # UI: Real Reactions ? # PM: I'm not quite sure , what does that mean ? # ID: I mean it still seems definitely fit that p so that's like if that's the new age kind of inno innovative c type company , then having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on # ME: So it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button , then maybe they could be a different shape . # ME: Like we got a cherry one . # ME: Maybe other ones could be something else shaped . # ME: That would be poss seeing as seeing as it's cheaper to make them a different seeing as we've got , you know , we've made it a special form , so # ME: And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one . # ME: And it would sort of , you know , keep it quite fancy as well , # PM: Well you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change , # PM: because at the moment you're making a red apple . # PM: So next year you could make next year's model the same , but have it as a whate whatever , a lemon . # ME: Well you could # ID: Whatever fruit was in fashion next year . # PM: , l a lemon or something . # ME: , I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something , maybe . # PM: And that amount # ME: So , we've what have we what have we rid of . # ME: We got rid of the plastic . # PM: we've the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it ? # ID: That , that was # ID: that was just about all . # ID: I think we've saved quite a bit because we've just got the push-button interface , which is by far the cheapest . # ID: So maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we've lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side ? # ID: And that is like the most standard type of button . # ME: So I mean , we've got we got rid of the rubber case , but we've now s we now sort of got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . # ME: So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability , we're pretty much the same , maybe . # ME: So , I mean we could maybe put two again on them . # ID: And everything else has stayed pretty much the same , so # PM: Well , ease has certainly stayed . # ID: plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to use . # ME: And what about the sort of innovation ? # ID: , well we've still got the kinetic energy . # PM: And the speech feature . # ID: , the speech feature . # ME: And then , the corporate identity . # ID: I think we've cut just about the same . # ID: We've maybe lost Hasn't it It's hard to tell how the rubber the rubber casing would really affect # PM: How it would play out , . # ME: Whether whether that's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity , I don't know . # ME: I mean , it's maybe not . I mean # ID: But I think more the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the actual aesthetics , but But either way , I think we've made it fairly close to what # ME: . Okay , well I mean # UI: I don't see how we could make it any more . # UI: , apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing . # UI: But then what colour would you make the R_s ? # ID: just the company logo . # ID: So maybe there's like a set design which we get printed off . # PM: Well , but you've got the company logo on there , which would effectively be a stick-on badge . # PM: So you're in a sense , you're comparing the product without the company logo . # PM: And then y but you've got the space for it to stick it on . # ME: Hey , what what's the company colour ? # ME: Did you get told what the company colour is or # ID: I'm still not quite sure we've established that . # PM: Don't think so . # PM: But but i but in the sense that , as you saw with the Windows logo badge , it doesn't really matter . # UI: We got the logo off the web browser . # PM: There's virtually n The way that you frame , you know , the Windows badge on there , it really doesn't matter what colour it is , so long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline . # PM: Fact , they've got black and white or black and silver . # PM: So basically , even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display , because you've got effectively a double edging on the on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product . # PM: And that's actually quite a sneaky way of doing it . # ME: 'Cause you've got sort of we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to . # PM: You could put in another # ME: Another colour . # PM: Well , in this one , you've actually got three colours of buttons . # ME: Or would that be t # PM: Well , we decided that the blue ones were the standard colour . # PM: So you were talking about We're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard . # PM: Which m may or may not be the case . # ME: Shall we save the point two for profitability then ? # PM: Bu but was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the on the other opt you know , on the second page , as it were , that you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ? # UI: , I don't think they would really need to be . # UI: I think if they were just all small round blue buttons , it'd be fine . # UI: Needs to be an enter button , but could just be the same as well . # ID: Maybe for the one they're gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and , fit the kind of idea of what they want . # ID: And then for the more functional buttons , we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like a plus it's hidden away anyway , you're not gonna see it at the start . # ME: I mean it's the sort of thing that , I mean , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume . # ME: So , if it's dead obvious , then that's fine . # ME: But if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning , then you're paying a bit more attention . # ME: So it may be sort of different colour buttons isn't so important . # PM: Alright . Okay . # PM: So we just add that to profitability in effect . # ME: I mean so we've dropped the cost , but # PM: Right , so we're meant to finish up in five minutes . # ME: Same sort of function ? The criteria ? # ME: Just made a load of money . # UI: Shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion , go to a three ? # UI: 'Cause we've lost the overall spongy feel . # UI: 'Cause it doesn't seem right that it just hasn't changed at all . # ME: Well , but I think we said that w Because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra an extra sort of fruit shape on one of the buttons . # UI: Did we decide what that was , which button it was ? # UI: On the volume ones ? # ME: I think well , we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something . # ME: Or something like that . # ID: Definitely lemon shaped . # ME: Did did you have to have a rubber case , though , for rubber buttons ? # ME: Or was it the other way around ? # ID: You had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case . # ID: So I think we can we're okay . # PM: So we're okay this way around . # PM: Until the design team comes in and says , get off . # ME: so we've saved # PM: But you are the design team . # ID: Then we say it's fine , so it's all good . # ME: Saved two Euros on that . # PM: So what bit are we on to ? # UI: , can I just check if that's a cherry or an apple ? # UI: Did we decide against the apple because of Apple Mac ? # UI: And did we make it a cherry officially ? # PM: I th I th Oh . Right , okay . # ID: Just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like . # PM: Oh drats , I've botched that , haven't I . # UI: So were we aiming for a certain target on that scale ? # ME: Well , we're aiming for one for all of them . # ME: M but it really has to fit into the budget , so I guess we just have to adjust things to get it i in the Which is fair enough . # ID: And we seem to have least something in each criteria . # ID: We haven't completely left anything out , so # ID: As an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we've just about achieved everything . # UI: So do we have anything else to discuss ? # ME: What's on the agenda ? # PM: Right , okay What's happened here ? # PM: Right , okay Right , okay , Right . So we got So we've done the finance bit and the Excel project and the We've done the redesign . # ID: We've got the closing . # PM: So we're now on to project process . # PM: Now satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . # PM: So , we're actually now , in a sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it . # PM: So what did you and remembering that nobody's just over the curtain . # ME: Finish your meeting now . # ID: We should just go through this quickly and then # PM: I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which I will do . # PM: So , I think I have to finish that page . # PM: Right , okay , so Project evaluation . # PM: Did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves well enough ? # ME: I thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary . # PM: Individual meetings . How do you mean ? # ME: Well , we were finding out various things in be in-between the meetings , # PM: In you on your own . # ME: and they didn't the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one , you know , sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you know , you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons , and I don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that . # ME: You know , you'd sort of you'd probably present it at one or something like that . # PM: The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that , you do that . # PM: Then you go away . # PM: You find out information . # PM: You then come back . # PM: You then discuss it . # PM: You then go and change things around , and then go back . # ID: , I suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time # PM: Whereas , this time , you're really getting it from a database source , # ID: and then diff things will be relevant . # PM: so it's not well Anyway , so , what do you want to put down ? # PM: I've put , seemed okay . # PM: Creativity , seemed okay . # PM: flow of information on any given subject given subject sometimes disjointed . # UI: I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . # UI: I mean a remote control isn't the most kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing . # ME: , the thing itself . # UI: I can't think of a better example at the minute . # PM: Have could have used a different example pel to increase create Creativity . # ID: Is this go It kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on . # PM: You have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing , so # ME: But think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . # ME: I mean it depends what sort of business you're in , I guess . # ME: I mean this one seems . From the website it looks it's quite innovative , but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we that's , you know , fifteen quid . # ID: one of those things . # ID: Like , companies can have like a range of products and I don't know how it works but I guess that something got sent out and have like a brief to kind of # PM: But the other thing is that they're I'm guessing that they're trying to use this software to demonstrate how you could do a project . # PM: I mean , m my wife at the moment , for instance , is acting as a computer you normally , you got a problem , so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed . # PM: So what she's doing is she's having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can ask whatever question . # PM: And then you or the idea is that the whichever person's at the other end can point them in the right direction , show them where to either give them directly give them help , or secondly , point them in the right direction , either at the library , or come back , or go and see Joe Bloggs , or whatever . # PM: So , and that was a project I suspect similar to this , because they were actually trying to debug the computer software to enable to enable it to work . # PM: And of course , you had the machine crashing and various things going wrong . So # ID: Well , sh we look at the last slide , see if it's got anything else . # ID: I think there's one more to go . # ME: I mean if you look at their products on their website here , Real Reaction , I mean it's all pretty high-tech and cutting edge . # PM: New ideas found , did we find any , # ID: It was quite good with this the white board , having that and the digital pens . # ID: Like , that's something that made it a little easier . # PM: Leadership , teamwork . # ME: we did find a new idea , I mean sort of a kinetic remote control . # ME: I've never seen one of them before . # ME: batteries , I think . So # ID: voice recognition , especially not could # PM: You've got voice recognition computers , that's not remote controls . # UI: Well it's a different application of it . # ID: , so it's just like the same products , but just put together in a different way . # PM: so how do you reckon teamwork went ? # ME: That went okay , . # ID: I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them . # PM: To go reasonably well . # ME: I don't think sort of the budget allowed us to do anything # PM: Bit bit arbitrary . # ME: Well , I mean I don't think it I just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products . # ME: I mean , they've got all these sort of , you know , high definition D_V_D_ and portable seven inch d lightweight computer screens , and I'm thinking , do you know , one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in . # PM: So , we're m we're meant to comment on leadership and the means , E_ G_ whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . # ME: Surely they should produ # PM: And and new i new ideas found was the other thing . # UI: Well leadership's a bit of a funny one , isn't it . # UI: But we can't really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the Project Manager . # UI: You were the leader . # UI: So our experience of leadership wasn't really as much as yours . # PM: Now , I'd much rather be in marketing I certainly didn't get this computer to work as well as I would have liked . # PM: However , Alright means , so whiteboard so really , it's equipment . Oh . # ME: Comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but # UI: But I mean , I d I don't I'm not sure I see the value in these . # UI: I mean , they record what you're writing , and then what do you do with it ? # UI: Where do you get the recording ? # UI: Do you plug the computer or something ? # ME: I think there's a little there's a little chi # ID: So it's not just for us , it's for the experiment as a whole , so # ME: There's a little there's a little chip , I think you must plug it into something # ID: Should we quickly look at the last slide ? # ME: and it produces a # UI: I think you watch a video of it kind of . # ME: Whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you've written or something , and Page after page . # PM: New ideas found , so one or two . # ME: Kinetic powered remote control . , what was the other one ? # UI: Voice recognition thing . # PM: and voice , was it voice activated # ME: Voice recognition , . S # PM: recognition . # ME: To fill in these fill in these questionnaires # PM: Right , so , are the costs within budget , Is the project evaluated , don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . # PM: Then celebration . # ID: . Is that everything ? # ME: I think that we've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting . # PM: , so we don't re So really I tried to save this the last time at twelve point three , and it didn't seem to have saved anywhere . # PM: Mind you , the figure last was different , but it should be poss .
# PM: Everybody ready ? # PM: I think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves # PM: and everybody's name and what your function is ? # ME: , that's a good plan . # PM: So maybe we start with you ? # UI: , my name is Francina . # UI: And I'm an user interface my role is the main responsibility is user interface . # UI: And my role is to design a television remote control . # ME: And I'm a marketing person . # ME: I wanna figure out how to sell them . # PM: And your name is ? # ME: My name is Eileen . # ID: I'm Jeanne-Oui . # ID: my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are uh deal with the technical-functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design . # PM: And as you already know I am Betty . # PM: I am the project manager for today . # PM: So why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do . # PM: Yes y opening , acquaintance , tool training well , the tools are , I think , we already I guess the tool is really our the computer , as far as I can see . # PM: we get ins each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there . # PM: Project plan , that falls under the same heading pretty much . # PM: , I don't think we have any great discussion at this point . # PM: Here is what this thing should be . # PM: This thing we are gonna design is a new remote control . # PM: should be original , trendy , and , of course , user friendly . # PM: So maybe you wanna make some notes of that . # PM: Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve . # PM: That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what we have come up with . # PM: The same goes for the conceptual design , there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards . # PM: Detailed design , same thing basically . # ME: Mm 'kay so Three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay . # ME: Functional , conception and detailed . # PM: I can't write with this thing . # ME: Maybe we should redesign it . # ME: After we've finished the remote control we'll get to that . # PM: Then , tool training try out the white board , participant can draw their favourite animal . # PM: Does anybody want to go and see how the white board works ? # PM: So that in case we have to , in the next meeting , present something on the white board . # PM: You wanna go Eileen and # ME: Okay , I'll see what I can do . # PM: Whether you without hanging yourself . # ME: See if I r See if I remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something . # PM: And remember you have to press so it works . # ME: So that it will record okay . # ME: traditional kitty cat . # ME: I've a very fat cat . # ME: And it likes to sit like that . # PM: And you're Francine , right ? # PM: Would you like s like just to see how it feels , so that you have a little idea ? # UI: Yes , I'm Francina . # ME: Am I supposed to wipe off that or # PM: No , no . No , that's okay . # PM: I don't know , we'll get to that later . # UI: What should I draw ? # UI: I'm going to draw a snake . # UI: How does it look like ? # ME: I hope the kitty cat is hungry 'cause I don't like snakes . # PM: Here's the project finance which , of course , we all have to think about when we design this thing . # PM: selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro . # PM: profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro , the market range unlimited meaning international and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro . # ME: Mm 'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged . # PM: So these are all things , of course , to remember with the budget and when you design to materials , cost , etcetera . # PM: Now , the discussion I guess is does anyone of you have experience with remote control ? # PM: I exp I s 'cause we use 'em we use 'em , right , everyday . # ID: , of course , using remote control . # PM: now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas ? # PM: Would you like it to be smaller , bigger , have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons , you know , things like that ? # UI: Yes , I feel that all the remote should be very compact . # UI: those which we get here nowadays it's very long . # UI: And and it should have multi-purpose . # UI: Like the remote control which we use for T_V_ , it shou it should be used f for some other purpose also , like controlling the temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system . # ID: Audio player . # PM: So it should be a multi-functional gadget that would control all your household uh machines basically . # ME: At twelve fifty Euros per Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that . # ME: We certainly can try to I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things . # PM: It should be something new it should be s it should do something different than just what we have . # PM: Now , of course , the other thing to think there is maybe the design . # UI: , design should be , it should be different . # UI: All the almost all the remotes # PM: Like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know . # PM: Maybe it should different colours or materials or you know . # ID: maybe ten I do , colours # UI: Are different shapes . # ID: and al shapes also . # PM: so shapes right , you know , like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something , you know . # ME: okay , friendly shape , that would help . # ME: I think another thing that would help is if it beeps when you clap , because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them . They can't find it . # PM: That is true , because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or , we you know , whatever . # PM: And and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the T_V_ off and they say , where the hell is my remote control ? # PM: Well or if it's really , if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a sound or a signal . # ID: some beep or something like that , # ME: so , so it's really the beep or , or a light should blink . # ID: so that we can go # PM: So if lost If lost signal with b throw signal , you know . # UI: Should ha A fluorescent signal , . # ID: maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is . # PM: Exactly , I mean just that's what I'm saying . # ID: May not be beep . # PM: I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beep or whether a light or # ID: Beep or it's a light , maybe it's a light . # ME: And do you think a good c clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ? # PM: Okay , my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden , in other words if it's like in a dark spot , meaning you know like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant , at that moment it's like , it's like , what you call it a light s sensors , you know ? # PM: In in that moment it has a sensor , i it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep , # PM: I mean , that we can discuss that later , you know . # ID: , probably , probably it's a # ME: So the light sensor would activate the signal . # PM: You know there would be right you have to have some kind of sensor and I think voice or clapping it's not specific enough . # PM: I know there are the lamps and stuff , you know , you can clap on and off , but I think they only work to certain degree and # ME: But it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it . # ID: , of course , that didn't # UI: Then , in that case # ME: Well , because you're s because you're silly . Because people are silly . # ID: I i we can't do it . # PM: Oh well , but then those people we can't help everybody . # ME: I mean it could be on well , i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table # ME: you know , well maybe we have to move along , okay . # PM: , we have to move along , but I think we have some good points to start with here . # PM: Okay , the next meeting will be in thirty minutes . # PM: I think you all did you get notices on your computer for this ? # PM: Okay so well , you got the notice . The working design , I guess that's the function I_D_ who is this ? # PM: The industrial designer That's you . # ID: , it's functional de , exactly , technical . # PM: So , we looking for a working design when we come back . # ID: working design , it's mainly technical-functional design . # PM: And then the technical funct you are the technical function , # ID: functional design , # PM: so you are the working design . # PM: So you have a working design and then a functional design . # PM: And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification , like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general . # PM: That would be your idea . # PM: And , of course , price . # PM: That it , that it , that the price is a good price . # PM: I mean , the price is given , but , that was # ME: We have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price . # PM: And , you know , specifi you will get specific instructions for that . # PM: I think that's the end of the show . # PM: So we have well , we have a twen two three minutes . # PM: any questions at this point ? # PM: Or suggestions ? # PM: I think basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions , I guess , you can # ME: Okay , I think I have enough to think about 'til our next meeting . # ME: How about you people ? # ID: , even I have , I think , . # ME: Alright , well # PM: Then we see you in about thirty minutes . # PM: And see what we can come up with . # ME: Okay , very good .
# PM: Okay , is everybody ready ? # ME: I'd to just put on my microphone here and I'll be right with you . # PM: I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do I think the Marketing Manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires . # ME: you want me to start right now ? # ME: Well , could you put my slides up 'cause I think it might be helpful if we looked at the slides at the same time . # PM: You're participant four . # ME: I'm participant four I believe . Yes uh-huh . # PM: Okay , and now I can full screen . # ME: Okay well I think we have introduced ourselves , # ID: And then full screen . # ME: so the functional requirements are is part of my goal but why don't we pass right to the second slide . # ME: Cause that's where m my discussion starts . # ME: Right well since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it . # ME: I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and th the reason I just put that there like that is that in the init in the initial stage I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions . # ME: You know you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run your car , it should heat up your motor if should turn on your C_D_ whatever you want it to do and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to design and budget feasibility . # ME: So I'll be coming to you frequently as the Industrial Expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do . # ME: So in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another , and then the things that seem the most attractive that to a customer we'll try to then prioritise those . # ME: So that was what I meant there , and as I said on the slide there consulting the Industrial Engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money , because if we're gonna sell this thing , I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present . # ME: Twenty five Euros makes a nice little present , and we want it to be an impulse purchase , we want somebody to see it and think it's , gee I just gotta have that . # ME: And take out their wallet and buy it . # ME: So it's gotta be really attractive but it's gotta go to market by September , 'cause anything that you don't already have out there in September showing it around , isn't gonna sell for Christmas . # ME: and then I'll be coming to you as the User Interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of the features and of the look and the colour and I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view . # ME: So I'll be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you , and I'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know , # UI: What features . # ME: what what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle , # UI: S sellable . Yes . # ME: 'cause we gotta sell this sizzle . # ME: A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for their child or for their husband or whatever . # ME: Okay can we go to the next slide please ? # ME: Alright I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible . # ME: So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we could suggest anything . # ME: I'd like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off , not something like you know whole house control what'll be And then I found on the internet from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . # ME: At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at , we should be able to make it work the T_V_ , the V_C_R_ , the stereo set maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp . # PM: okay , can I at this point interject something ? # ME: I have to wind up ? # PM: we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be considered . # PM: the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext , because that's sort of outdated with the internet , and according to higher management the it should only control the T_V_ , mostly because they feel that it's too comp complex a task to include other things , # ID: Complicated , of course . # PM: and they are concerned with the time to market . # ME: Okay , so that's something # PM: and the third thing that they wanna make sure that their that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product , so that it's easy that they can be easily identified as a product of the company , and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out . # PM: So I just wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much off track here with the things we wanna look at . # PM: These were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate these things , so it's only gonna be T_V_ , but the one thing maybe that could be eliminated is the teletext idea . # ME: Alright , thanks for that . # ME: alright now other things that I found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now . # ME: 'Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room . # ME: so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address , we wanna s make it as simple as possible , we wanna make it obvious and intuitive to use , and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as maybe a beep , and I think that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate . # ME: 'Kay can we go to the next slide please ? # ME: Okay , so , my personal preferences in this project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle . # ME: That is the selling point , the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase . # ME: because once there's no be-back , well in sales they always say you know , be-backs don't come back . # ME: If somebody says , oh I'll come back and get it next week you're dead . # ME: They're never gonna come back and buy it . # ME: You've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now w now is a big word in my book for selling this thing . # ME: And , in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve , make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use . # ME: We have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , so that's why I'm saying , simplicity is good . # ME: Finding it's important , obviously you can't use it if you can't find it . # ME: So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and I've already said this several times but I put it down in writing here , it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five Euros . # ME: So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , twenty five Euros I'm not gonna take that . # ME: Has to be so great that they're gonna say , twenty five Euros isn't much . # ME: and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign . # ME: Okay that's about it for me right now . # PM: who would be next , I guess that would be you . # PM: You want me to get your slide show up ? # PM: And you are number three ? # ID: can you make it full screen please ? # ID: it's like a well you have to press here . # ID: The cup shape here ? # ID: The thir third . # ID: so today I'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller . # ID: can you go to the next sli slide please ? # ID: The metal is like in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller . # ID: It takes the power from a battery say a battery it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to like switch connec connect your remote controller to power supply from the you know electricity or something like that . # ID: It should be a battery because uh remote controller should be like you should take it t to wherever you want and then th this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it's like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a T_V_ or a air conditioner , something like that so . # ID: a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device . # ID: If you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like th the remote controller it sends some bits some waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is . # ID: It should re recognise the waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then the remote controller will send a send a se send a signal , # ID: and the T_V_ it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that , change the volume control # ID: and so I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple devices . # UI: Multi-purpose . # ME: well that's already been eliminated by management , so we're off the hook . # ID: So user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user in interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there . # ID: So you can control whatever you want , you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you want to mute the T_V_ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there's a there should be some device to tell what to do to the in integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and T_V_ can perform the actions . # ID: So can you go to the next slide please ? # ID: So I just would like to add some extra features to the remote controller I think these are the very simple features and they don't take much uh much of the um investment also , it's like el the text or buttons which are there on the remote controller they those we can make like fluorescent they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark . # ID: And ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's this is not a you know a action , there can be no action taking to that so . # ID: And there should be a child lock , like uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller . # ID: If make it useable for more than one device it's a it's hard but I think it's possible # PM: well that has been e that has been eliminated , so that's unfortunately a moot point now . # ME: Well we already eliminated that . # ID: And different shapes that we can do like we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable whi which can fit into your hands and so that # ME: Now that's good from a marketing point of view , the fun the fun shape . # ID: colours also , different colours , and # ME: And that you say that won't add too much to the budget ? # ID: No no , it won't I don't think it will be like , # ME: To d the shape is # ID: you can have you know for if you want ther there to be more # PM: It just build a mould basically and you know . # ID: It's it's just a s shape so it doesn't matter . # PM: As the budget we're looking at if you build one mould I don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's gonna be square or # ME: Do you think there's any chance of having ser in having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes ? # ID: that is also possible I . # ME: Is that gonna be a possible ? # ME: 'Cause that might help with the marketing . # PM: I think we will have to look at the budget on that # PM: but I think in principle that would be that would be kind of fun , you know . # ME: Because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of # PM: Silly for children . # ID: , for children , exactly . # ME: silly for children # PM: Like an animal or # ME: or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is . # UI: Like a doll , or # ID: And and the butto buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons . # ID: If there are more buttons then it will be more complicated . # ID: If you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive , so I think we need to make some buttons which are which are like f in intended for two or three operations , like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel , if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour . # ID: So if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but I think it will complicate the matter more I think so . # ME: Well , I think I think that that's something that we'll have to discuss with the User Interface person because I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature . # ME: Because I think one of the things were complaining about in my what I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one . # ME: The changing modes was something # ID: , it's like you know . # ME: I mean you and I , all f all four of us we work with computers all the time , changing modes is nothing for us , but people who # PM: , a little elderly , a little arthritic hand you know , and it's a small button and it they don't press it exactly you know something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else and they're very frustrated you know . # UI: Something else . # ME: And that's and that's the kind of thing people learn by feel , and you don't feel the mode change . # ID: , you don't us yeah , usually . # ME: So maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too . # ID: shapes also , different shapes . # ME: You know , like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels , so that people can develop a tactile sense of it . # ME: But we'll get to that with you . # ID: also text should be very clear so that there won't be any ambiguities and # ME: That's right , . Now that's a good point . # ID: And display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it's # ME: that's a good that's a good one , # ID: , and we display a clock . # ME: because the clock would be really friendly , and when is your favourite show coming on # ID: , and then you can just see your remote controller yeah so # PM: you're sitting there already or maybe you have no other # ME: , and a lot of time there's not a clock on the screen , and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute . # ME: that's good , the clock is good . # ID: can you go to the next slide please ? # ID: components the main components we need for it ha like buttons and underneath that there should be switch . # ID: Like we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or whenever the T_V_ is on suppose , then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light . # ID: Then it will be like if you switch on your T_V_ through anoth another source , not from through a remote controller and you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light . # ID: Maybe we can have that . Whenever the T_V_ is on , remote controller will have a light . # ID: And then infrared bulbs . # ID: this is like when it is dark . # ID: And battery , there should be a battery for power supply , and a chip , chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations , and wires connecting all chips , which is lights , everything , so there should be wires . # ID: And uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and , you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape . # UI: To keep the remote ? # UI: A case holder . A holder remote holder . # ID: can you move onto the next slide . # ID: next sli slide please . # ID: I have referred the site the homepage of the our website , from where I have uh I got s few points . # ID: That's it , that's it from me now . # ME: So it we should visit this site and have a look at what's up there ? Or # PM: Well , you don't have to . # ID: it's not like that , I have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so and so . # ME: Okay . So it might be helpful if we had a look at that . # ME: Could you go back to that slide where she had that s slide up Betsy ? # ID: , it's actually there now , there on the screen . # PM: And Francine ? # UI: Participant two . # PM: You are number two ? # UI: No no , I'm three . # PM: Would you want it full screen ? # UI: I can make it full ? # UI: As User Interface Designer I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote . # UI: can you please go onto the next slide ? # UI: So I found out that but the main purpose of a remote is to f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance . # UI: Now for that , a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the T_V_ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the T_V_ . # UI: There should be a signal something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to change the channels or increase the volume he can change it . # UI: Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a particular programme according to the user choice . # PM: On the on the remote . # UI: So if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time , and the T_V_ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time . # UI: So he can use that kind of uh properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel . # PM: By your child , . # UI: And the and the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote . # UI: t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the T_V_ television . # UI: And as uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T_ in alphabet for more compactability . # UI: And and it is one more point which I noted it down , like the material which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something some al allergy to either children or to ad adult person . # UI: And it should have an it can have an alarm clock a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight P_M_ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock , and I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote . # ID: If there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock . # ME: And an alarm clock , that should that should be okay . # UI: and as John Reece said the buttons can be , can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different buttons will glow differently . # UI: So in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel . # UI: And uh the design of the remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote , he should not be harmed in any way . # UI: And findings , I found out y on different sites that there are different remotes which can be used , there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities , there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are So there you have different types of remotes for different light source which are used which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television . # UI: And these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use . # UI: like it can it can be used as a T_V_ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock , and then to save electricity there should not be much s move lots of circuits and all that . # UI: And if a person if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically , so that nobody else comes later and use it . # ID: It's like a t okay , it's like a timer it's like a lock to the television . # UI: Timer . and then you can use a timer as well . # PM: now I have On my slide show basically we already we have already done the agenda , and on the closing basically there will be lunch break and all that . # PM: However the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group . # PM: And what function , working design , how does it work . # PM: So these are the two things we should come up wit with . # PM: So the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on who is our target group . # PM: I guess in many ways everybody . # PM: Everybody who has a T_V_ . # UI: T_V_ television we was . # PM: and I think today there are probably not many people who don't have a T_V_ . # PM: There are a few but in general not . # PM: Now , talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody , but I think within the target group we have subgroups . # PM: We have we have earlier it was mentioned about for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands , so I think that's one group that's certainly important . # PM: then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything unless it's really very clear . # PM: And I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use . # PM: I mean that's a question whether that's important that children can really use it or not . # PM: So this these are just some thoughts I have on it , and I dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing or whether we're looking at what we like we talking about different shapes , whether that different shape also includes maybe different buttons for different groups . # ME: Well you know there's the old motto , children under six never shop alone . # ME: So if you've designed something that's very attractive to children the mummy please mummy please you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it that has a lot of marketing pull . # PM: That has a lot of that has a lot of appeal but I think I'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups . # PM: I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours . # PM: You know , like you make it nice and pink , fluorescent , banana colour or whatever you know # UI: Different colours . # ME: You can make a banana shaped one . # PM: , for example you know . # PM: But the question is really , who is our target group . # PM: Do we look at one target group ? # PM: And with the twenty five Euros you know can we can we afford to have I'm asking the technical people here whether to look at sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to respect ? # UI: No generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with f age from ten to forty and then we can add on specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes . # ID: We can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know . # UI: But in a family in a family there will be a aged person , children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes . # ID: Children and everybody , . # UI: They would like to buy just one and just one which can be used all the three # ID: of course that we can do , but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in a different you know . # ME: What about the electronics ? That's not really gonna change much , is it ? # UI: Cost effective . # ID: No , it doesn't cost , . # ME: That that w that won't change much , will it ? # ID: Doesn't doesn't matter . # PM: The the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function , # ME: I d I wouldn't think so . # PM: and I think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know , within the target group or subgroups . # PM: The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense . # PM: I mean the basic design I understand will be the same , but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example . # PM: So that remains to s to be seen but the target group as a whole is basically everybody with a T_V_ . # ME: That's right , and can we can we is it even feasible to make one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ? # PM: , well that's the question . # ME: the same electronics and basically all that's gonna be different is the plastic case . # ME: And in that case we could probabl moulded plastic isn't all that expensive is it ? # ID: no . Mm , I don't think no . It's not . # ME: you as an industrial person ? # PM: Well maybe there's an idea you know t the new for example new portable phones ? # PM: They have like removable plastic cases , so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one , or whatever , and maybe something like that , that in each package you know you have you have you have for example you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package . # ME: Well there's a real idea . # PM: And then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately . # ID: , like for mobile phones we have different you know covers , like designs and all so that w we can have that . # PM: That's right , but like if then everybody is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package , then they can go to the store and for a few Francs or Euros whatever they can buy # ME: An alternate package . # PM: an alternate package with another two colours in it you know for example you know . # UI: But I have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we if we design a remote having all the different features for different people or designing three different remotes for three different categories of people . # PM: Well I think I think the idea here is to d design one remote # ME: Well I think we can only aff , # PM: and what the only change is gonna be the funct d t # PM: the functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way , having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people either for children Five minutes that was I guess tha that's the old message . # ME: Warning , finish meeting now . # PM: Finish meeting now . # ME: Well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but # ID: If we do some more research , maybe we . # PM: I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody . # PM: If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that . # PM: Do we agree , do we ? # ID: I think maybe seventy percent is a unique uh remote controller and thirty percent is it's sort of like . # ME: Okay but we have to l # PM: Do we agree on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not . # ME: Okay , fair enough . # PM: So now I understand it's lunch break . # PM: So that's what we will do . # PM: So hank you very much . # PM: And we'll see you after lunch .
# PM: Hello everyone . # PM: first we going over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . # PM: in the last meeting the marketing manager had presented her method of working , meaning gathering i suggestions from everyone to see how she best could market this product at the within the budget that was given . # PM: in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . # PM: it's also an item that people lose a lot . # PM: So we should address that . # PM: And , of course , it should be something s that is very simple to use . # PM: In addition to that to make it sell , of course , the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive , or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that's a very important fact , 'cause if they say , well , I go home and think about it , that won't work . # PM: also mentioned was it should be it should have a very short learning curve . # PM: And maybe it could be sold by using a slogan . # PM: Our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip that has infra-red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip . # PM: Therefore , messages will be controlled in the same manner . # PM: There should be extra features like lid buttons , maybe a beep . If too many buttons are pressed , mm uh child lock and maybe a display clock so that people could you could see the time , you know , what show they want to watch . # PM: Also mentioned was maybe different shapes . # PM: So the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra infra-red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , and maybe some kind of a holder for the for the item . # PM: Francino who is our # UI: Interface designer . # PM: interface designer has mentioned that the that it , of course , should have an on-off button , and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock . # PM: Particularly with maybe small children that they couldn't watch a channel that is undesirable . # PM: It should be compact . # PM: Her personal favourite was it should be T-shaped . # PM: And maybe have an anar alarm-clock . # PM: And the material should possibly be not of non-allergic nature . # PM: the different systems that exist are infra-red or radio-waves . # PM: maybe it should have electri electrici electricity saving feature . # PM: And even possibly a timer to so that people can program their favourite uh program on th right from the remote . # PM: are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time ? # ME: , I think that pretty much is it . # PM: then we I'm looking for three presentations . # PM: And I don't know whether the order matters much , I don't I don't think so , so whoever w wants # UI: Okay , I can start first . # UI: Now my slide , please . # PM: Okay , your slides . Okay . # PM: Oh , come on , close already . # PM: And that's number two , right ? # UI: Participant three . # UI: Now as an interface designer , I would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like so that it is sellable , it is attractive to customers . # UI: Okay . Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television . # UI: This messages could be switch on-off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel , like you can have the numbers one , two , three , four , up to nine . # PM: Nine what ? Nine channel switches ? # PM: Nine channel switches ? # UI: Yes , nine numbers . # UI: And then you have swapping of button by which using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa . # UI: Then it should have a next button , and next button channel by which you can keep on v mm eh scrolling the channels one by one . # ID: Going to the nex next . # UI: Next slide , please . # UI: Then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume . # UI: Then , there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television . # UI: For example , if you are watching a French program and you would like to have a subtitles in English , then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see the subtitles on the screen . # UI: Then there should d there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour , colour of the picture , the contrast , sharpness , brightness of the picture . # UI: Now there should be a memory switch . # UI: There should be a mute button . # UI: Suddenly if uh viewer he gets a telephone call , and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the T_V_ , but he can reduce the sound , he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can while talking he can watch the T_V_ . # UI: Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature . # UI: It's an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit . # UI: So a remote can be th can be designed which can have the voice recognisers , you can record your own voice which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television , for example , if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel , th now the , the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel . # UI: So the T_V_ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities . # UI: So this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have . # UI: So this is one of the interface which can be created . # UI: A very simple interface which has all the t uh important features . # UI: Then , please , next slide . # UI: Then , these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour , but they have many buttons . # UI: So sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that . # UI: So you can you can design an interface which is very simple , and which is user-friendly . # UI: Even a kid can use that . # UI: So can you go on t to the next slide . # UI: , so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser . # UI: And this has multi-purpose use , it can be used for T_V_ , it can be used for cable-satellite , it can be used for V_C_R_ , D_V_D_s and audio . # UI: And this has in-built voice recogniser . # UI: Can you go on to the next slide ? # UI: , now this is an interface for a chil for a remote uh which a child can use . # UI: this is user-friendly , it's very attractive and children can use it as well as they can play with it . # UI: And this comes with different colours , different shapes . # UI: And this child interface has minimum buttons and all the important buttons are there in this small , compact , attractive child interface . # UI: Next slide , please . # UI: Now this is a big over-sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace . # ME: You don't know me . # ME: I could lose that in a minute . # UI: So this is No this is a very big , you cannot misplace it anywhere . # UI: So this is a jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to im misplace or lose . # UI: This i this is one such interface which can be created . # UI: And the personal preference would be a spe uh to incorporate speech recognisers which will respond to user's voice for a particular function . # PM: Okay , thank you very much . # PM: any comments on her presentation ? # ME: Well , looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there . # ME: what I'm No suggestion's bad . # ME: But we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more . # ME: I don't think that we can get The T-shape is good , the child one is good , the too big to misplace , I think it's just funny . # ME: I don't think that's gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter . # ME: It's it's gonna be a little bit too unwieldy . # PM: No , I think the these are her presentations , but as far as the decision making we getting to that after # ME: Have to come back to that later . Okay . # PM: I just wanted to know whether anybody had any anything to add to her presentation . # ME: No , I think her presentation was good , and she really explored all the options . # PM: Ho who wants to go next ? # ID: Participant two . # ID: the next one , sorry . # ID: It's it was the old one . # PM: The components design . # ID: this time I'm going to concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design . # ID: , can you go on to the next slide , please . # ID: I have just brief down few components which we require for the remote control construction . # ID: the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit , battery , etcetera , etcetera , it's like it can be a plastic one , hard plastic , so that it can be strong , even if you just uh , you know , if you if it falls down , then it doesn't break . # ID: So it should be strong . # ID: And uh there are no harmful materials used in that . # ID: And it should be recyclable . # ID: and also using of colouring compon components like if we want to have different colours , blue , red , green , so uh we have to use some colouring compone components . # ID: And the second important thing is uh integrated circuit . # ID: which we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller . # ID: If it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be like the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one . # ID: And it should be resistant to high as well as low temperatures . # ID: Suppose if it is thirty-eight degrees outside forty degrees outside , it should it should be able to re resist the temperature uh highs and high temperatures and low temperatures . # ID: And it should be with equipped with timer and alarm facility . # ID: And the other component we should we have in the remote controller is a resistor which is like uh i it is very much important for the electricity flow through the remote controller and also a capacitor which is a b which is a m I think it's like a battery , capacitor . # ID: Can you go on to the next slide , please ? # ID: a diode , a transistor , a resonator , these are all this technical electri electronic compons components which are which we have to use in a remote controller . # ID: A battery , I would like to suggest one thing if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery , even if it is a low performance battery it ca it can't l it can't charge much . # ID: It it it's not a high voltage battery . # ID: Then also we can If it is a rechargeable one , then people can use it for a long time , so in that way we can cut the cost , but w uh that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one . # ID: And we have a circuit board in a remote controller . # ID: Can you go to the next slide , please . # ID: And how it works , how the remote controller works . # ID: when you press a button , when you do that , you complete a specific connection that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button , and it will send some signals through the wires , and then the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed . # ID: Suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the chip will know that the number one button was pressed . # ID: It pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button . # ID: Every button , every individual button , has its own morse code . # ID: Suppose the user has pressed butto button one , then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that button , and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . # ID: Like you have got a signal by pressing a button . # ID: That's a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit . # ID: Now , that signal , that morse code , has to be amplified by the transistor . # ID: That is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller . # ID: It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the L_E_D_ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits . # ID: The sensor on the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately , that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal , then it will it will know which what action it has to do . # ID: Then it will do the appropriate action . # ID: So this is how the remote controller works . # ID: Can you go to the next slide , please . # ID: , I have few pictures . # ID: When you look at the remote controller it's it this is a normal remote controller . # ID: And to the next slide , please . # ID: And where we had a few buttons and all . # ID: And if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components , like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins , and also a capac a capacitor , three resistors and also a resonator and di and a diode transistor . # ID: The electronic components all of the electronic components have all those things like a chip and d diode transistors an , di can y you can see the T_A_ double one eight three five labelled chip . # ID: you can also see the uh the green two green things are these are they are they are resistors , and just beside that you can see a transistor , and a uh cylinder shape , that one is a capacitor . # ID: and also there are resistors sorry , ther there is a diode . # ID: Can you go on to the next slide . # ID: So this is the circuit board . # ID: The green one is a circuit board . # ID: Actually , building a circuit bo board is pretty easy and also it's a it's a l inexpensive . # ID: it's it costs less than what you print on a paper , because when you when you are building some circuits some circuits and also wires , it's better to go for printing , because you can build these kind of k circuit boards on a on a bulk and it's just printing , nothing like , you know , you don't need to use wires and all . # ID: It's not exactly wires we are using . # ID: It's just printing something on a board . # ID: Tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci circuits . # ID: So th that green thing is a circuit board , and also you can see there are b s like access for buttons , like when you press a button , the circuit under the button will be activated th it will it will he get some signals from it and it will it will ch its ch se send a signal signals to the , integrated circuit . # ID: Can you go to the next slide , please . # ID: so this is these are the circuits un underneath the buttons . # ID: can you see the black , round marks ? # ID: They they are the circuits . # ID: And like we have designed before we have seen some few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls . # ID: b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range . # ID: Like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and k uh full a complete chip . # ID: and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious hard dynamo , a kinetic provision of energy , more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy . So that also we can have in a battery , or we can use solar sells . # ME: , that's interesting . # ID: the product can be de delivered into different cases . # ID: usually , the cases and card flat that w we see usually d a normal remote controller . # PM: And you have more pictures . # PM: we have five minutes to the end of the meeting . # ID: , maybe d I have just one more slide , I think . # ID: Like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , but titanium we can't use . # ID: and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular re or an advanced chip on the print , also infra it includes the infrared se sender . # ID: the for the movie just to j develop samples and so spe sample speaker . # ID: It's all for me now , # PM: well thank you . # PM: Any particular comments by anybody ? # ME: , on the scroll and the push-button , ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button ? # ID: No , no , no , th the scrolling wheels are different , like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls , which we used to do before ten years before , I think . # ID: Now , nobody uses that because you need you need a k sophisticated chip and all . # ID: So I think it's better we go for ordinary buttons . # ME: We'll just go for push buttons # ID: , push-buttons . # UI: Push-buttons . # ME: for in the interest of cost . # PM: We don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision , and the marketing expert has to present her thing . # ME: Go right to my first my next slide . # ME: alright , my method is I'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , so I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . # ME: I s I spend a lot of time on the internet surfing around doing the same thing . # ME: And then when I'm out in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that , I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have , and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it . # ME: And I would encourage you all to do the same . # ME: and my findings from this is that , you know , small is beautiful . # ME: people like something that really fits in their hand . # ME: Simple is beautiful . # ME: They don't want to have to squint at small print , they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want as few buttons as possible , and they don't care for the mode thing . # ME: They want each button to do something . # ME: And eye-catching is important . # ME: It's gotta look cute , it's gotta look appealing . # ME: Go ahead , I'm trying to finish fast for you . # ME: and our preference is , as far as I'm concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition . # ME: Ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others , so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item . # ME: And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign . # ME: If we try to tell people it has too many great features , the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere . # ME: So we've gotta narrow our selection down to li two things , I think , that we gonna say are really great about our new product . # ME: And I've been looking around at what designs every year different things are popular . # ME: And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular . # ME: And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal . # ME: They are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them . # ME: So those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item . # PM: that concludes the presentation of everyone . # PM: And what we really have to decide in this meeting is the concept of the remote . # PM: And so what do we think on the concept of the remote ? # ME: You wanna try to come back to yours , and limit yours a bit ? # UI: I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser . # ME: So speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned ? # UI: This could be one feature which could be sellable . # ME: h that could that could that could be our star feature . # PM: I think that's # ME: That that be really good , I agree with that . # ID: , but I what I'm very much doubtful how far it will work , because a speech recogniser like i it has its own uh problems , issues . # ME: Distance problem ? # ID: , it's not distance problem it it's recognising a person's voice , like maybe different people will be having different voices , so it like it's everything so i # PM: Well , you teach You have to teach # ID: So to get a good recogni recognising system , it's a costly thing , I think . # UI: No , it's , it it's like your recording of all a question already , and then you're expecting an answer from th For example , you have a T_V_ system , I'm the user and my family members are the user , I will already record a question like , good morning , like around eight o'clock I want to see the news in the television . # UI: So I'll say just good morning and the T_V_ will switch on . # UI: It will recognise my voice and will switch on . # PM: Okay , before we get too far off here , the components of the concept is the energy . # PM: What kind of energy do we foresee ? # ME: I think I think battery , # ME: and I think we all agreed on that . # ME: That that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing . # PM: Okay then chip on print . # PM: And I think we all agree on the case , we wanna have something maybe bright , colourful . # ME: Bright , colourful , trendy design , and strong . # ID: And also strong . # UI: Trendy design and compact . # PM: Trendy design , compact and strong . # PM: User interface concept , interface type , supplements That will be your area I think , right , Jana . # ID: like the switches , like we use buttons for user interface . # UI: Push-buttons . # PM: Put k I guess for # ID: Push-buttons . # PM: Not sure what they mean by supplements . # UI: Supplements like different types of features buttons , like can have a f mute button or a swapping button . # ME: Well , I think that # ME: or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement . # ME: Her speech recognition feature would be a supplement . # PM: Right , right , right , . # UI: Recogniser . Yes . # ME: Okay , so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is . # PM: Okay . our next meeting will be in thirty minutes , and the I_D_ is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then , to have the look and feel design , and the U_I_D_ is supposed to come up with the user interface design , and the marketing expert with the product evaluation . # PM: In this phase , the two of you , Jana and Francine , have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay , it says here . # PM: You will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches . # PM: if you have any questions , you know , you can always contact me or your coach , I suppose . # ME: Wherever they're hiding ? # PM: I think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in uh thirty minutes , according to our timetable here . # PM: Thank you very much .
# PM: Well hi everyone again . # PM: like before we I have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting and so here we go . # PM: it was discussed in the last meeting which was opened by the presentation from the interface designer that looks would be very important on this new remote # PM: and it is to send messages of course to the T_V_ . # PM: It should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera . # PM: It should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings or something . # PM: speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal features she would like see d to be integrated in this in this new remote . # PM: Should be child friendly design with few buttons , colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons . # PM: she presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose . # ME: And she was challenged on that point # PM: But her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . # PM: The industrial designer presented her thoughts on the issue . # PM: She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . # PM: Should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . # PM: She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . # PM: technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery . # PM: and of course a circuit board . # PM: And how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse code related relays the to the generat to the generator amplification and the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature to consider . # PM: She would like this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . # PM: Should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases . # PM: The marketing expert who has to finally come up with to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . # PM: From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . # PM: To do that maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . # PM: Too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . # PM: So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really driven home . # PM: it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . # PM: She feels that's really what people want today . # PM: And the decision that we took last time was that the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , the energy should be battery should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons . # PM: And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting . # PM: Now we are ready for the presentation of the prototype . # UI: Just the look like , the button part I'll explain . # ID: so this is our what we have made . # ID: This is a model of the remote control which we are going to build . # ID: this is us in a snail shape so it is attractive and it's blue in colour bright and it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons so it is a uh a looks-wise it is beautiful . # ID: and also compact in shape . # ID: and also i it will be easily fit into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily . # ME: You used to have all the buttons # ID: the material which we are going to use for the case is plastic and w which is s strong and also for the material is plastic and for the buttons it is s soft rubber and als # ME: Oh that's good , no , that's nice and friendly . # ID: because uh you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it . # ID: And then for the for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it's a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared . # ID: and the button button's part will be explained by F Francina . # UI: Now the we decided upon including certain features on our remote . # UI: Now these features includes the s signal emitting signal it's the led or L_E_D_ the infrared . # UI: Now we have included the switch on and off button . # UI: Now we have included another feature that is the mute button on the side of the model . # UI: Then we have included one to nine buttons for controlling the programmes the different channels . # UI: We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume . # UI: And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels . # UI: Now our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button . # PM: What kind of button ? # PM: menu th menu , one . # UI: At the centre we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness # ME: Of the screen . Mm , . # UI: of this picture . # UI: We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button . # UI: Now this is a special , special feature which we have included . # UI: Now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel . # UI: It will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a swapping button . # ME: The next channel in the numeric pattern , or # UI: No , swapping is if example you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button . # UI: And at the end , it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly . # UI: So this is our proposed model . # UI: Now the marketing expert has to give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable or it'll be cost effective . # ME: Okay , well what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb , # ME: that you can really hold it in one h you don't need two hands and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand , ? # PM: Yes the buttons are all raised , right ? # ME: The buttons are all raised # ME: and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down , # PM: Or have two hands to operate it , . # ME: I really like that . # ME: You really did a good job on that , my little designers . # ME: I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place . # ME: That's that's a really good thing . # PM: and it sort of sticks up so that you really # PM: you don't have to g first go like oh here it's on and , . # ME: The colour's very attractive . # ME: the these buttons around here are the mute # UI: No , these the front buttons which are here , are the mute buttons . # ME: On both sides they're mute ? # ME: So you can push either one ? # PM: So if you're left-handed or right-handed it doesn't matter . # ME: And this brings the menu up on the screen ? # UI: This is the menu yes , yes . # ME: This brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are # UI: A the these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes , and these two are to scroll the programme channels . # UI: Scroll up or scroll down the channels . # ME: Right , very good . # ME: it looks mm looks like something I can sell . # ME: Okay and now I'm supposed to # PM: Well , I have one question will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ? # UI: Yes , it will have these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols . # PM: Will have symbols so that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it # UI: Yes , which can be easily recognised . # ME: Good point because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent . # ID: of course , and also # PM: But anyway it would ha i it has to have some kind of symbols , text or something so that people kn # ME: Symbols on it . , . # ID: Text that we can have on the case itself , # ID: it will be printed on the case and symbols as well as the buttons . # PM: Okay , just wanted make sure of that . # UI: and one more feature is we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape . # UI: A shell shape . # ME: For the snail , # ME: we have the snail shell . # UI: Yes , snail shell . # ME: He goes right back into his shell . # ME: Well you know I think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that # ME: you know that would , that would really work . # PM: Now what , what are our special features for the marketing ? # PM: That's really the voice recognition that's really unusual # ME: I think voice recognition is our big selling point 'cause nobody else seems to have that in this price range . # PM: And then , and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use . # ME: well I think that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical . # ME: I think we have to , we have to dwell on the appearance . # ME: We're really gonna have the be the # ME: cutest remote control on the block . # ME: So I think we have to play with the image , play with the snail image play with the visual and then the voice recognition . # ME: I think those are the two things to push . # ME: The look and the voice recognition . # ME: They're gonna be our two selling points . # PM: now having said that # ME: I'm supposed to make a little presentation , aren't I ? # PM: No , now this was our evaluation criteria which we just have done . # PM: Now we're gonna talk about financing . # ME: , but in my instructions I think it said I was supposed to go to the board and do something . # PM: Well , there is a production evaluation . # PM: But that's after the financing . # ME: Sorry , sorry . Mm-mm . # PM: Okay , we had looks and voice recognition . # PM: Okay now on the financing we bring up the mm there it is . # PM: Okay energy source we say that's battery , right ? # PM: So we I guess we use one . # PM: T cell or chart you are trying to change is protected . # PM: Well , that's nice . # PM: She told me I could just ch change it here and then it would It doesn't work . # ME: Can you just fill it in the yellow boxes ? Or # PM: Oh , okay , okay , let's see . # PM: Okay , one , okay . # PM: kinetic source so that's in the energy source that's all we need . # PM: electronics , simple chip on print ? # PM: Is that's what we're using ? # PM: regular chip on print . No . # PM: That's all we need , the one case , uncurved flat , single curved , double curved . # UI: Single curve ? # ME: I guess it's double curved . # PM: Double curved ? # PM: Case materi s supplements . # PM: Plastic we said , # ME: Rubber , because we're gonna have the soft buttons . # ID: I think that is f for rubbers that is case material . # PM: That's just for the case material , # UI: Is this for the case ? Yes . # PM: so special colours though , we having that , # ME: Oh okay , the , mm' kay . # PM: And then we have to interface push buttons . # PM: Scroll wheel , no . # PM: Integrated scroll wheel , L_C_ display ? # ME: 'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all , # PM: , button supplement special colour ? # PM: Special form ? # UI: Yes d we do have special form . # PM: And special material , rubber , wood , yes . # PM: Total seven point six whatever that means . # ID: , I think that's the price . # PM: That's the price . # UI: One two three four five six seven eight nine # ID: Maybe it is it just n # PM: Eight , eight point two . # UI: Nine points , okay , yes . # PM: Eight point two , right ? # PM: looks like we are well within budget . # PM: I guess I should save this I suppose , huh ? # UI: On the desktop . # PM: I just tried that . # PM: My documents , computer . # PM: My compu oh here it is , yes . # ID: AMI should for # PM: Okay , fine . Save . # PM: Okay good , so that's the good news . # PM: We gonna be popular . # PM: So that I think financing was pretty simple . # PM: Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation . # ME: Okay , I'll take my file down so you can bring it up . # ME: 'Kay should be able to get it now . # ME: 'Kay , why don't you move just to the next slide right away . # PM: You wanna go to the next slide ? # ME: Okay , well obviously my method for s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? # ME: And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we haven't thought of . # ME: We can't accept every suggestion of course , but maybe we just need to get a few . # ME: And show the prototype to consumer research groups , we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any . # ME: So we have to get some input from those people . # ME: And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it , we think it's good , we're gonna get behind it and sell it . # ME: , next slide please . # ME: Okay , now the things that I was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . # ME: I wanted the shape to be biomorphic , I didn't want anything with angles and all square , I wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that . # ME: The size is small , the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted . # ME: We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we'll have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped , even though it's gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that's nice . # ME: And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it . # ME: So paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel and the shape , that's what people are gonna get in the store . # ME: They don't have a television in the store , they can't play with it . # ME: so they'll be our main selling points . # ME: th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please . # ME: Okay , so the shape I think is a one . # ME: That's really , really excellent shape . # ME: The size is small and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these aren't i in how I feel . # ME: I think that it's I think that it's plenty small enough to sell but I think we're sort of right the scale is one to seven . # ME: I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors . # ME: And our colour I think is great . # ME: The colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . # ME: And given the constraints that we had I think we got it as soft as possible . # ME: And then functionality I think you did a really good job on functionality , obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on functionality . # ME: So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it . # PM: I just realised one thing . # PM: In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser . # PM: And I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too . # ME: Well , we had what , eight euros twenty as our cost ? # PM: Eight , eight twenty , yes . # ID: Eight twenty so # ME: And so we've got we've still got four euros to go to spend . # ID: We have four euros , # PM: I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean four thirty . # PM: But I mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished , as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much . # PM: So we just have to beware of that . # PM: I mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that . # ME: Well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the problem is quality . # ME: So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us . # ME: And it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway . # ME: As we've seen with so many of these kinds of products . # PM: I'm sorry to interrupt then but I just recog I just remembered that there was no that was not included that there was no room for any special features , okay ? # PM: So to beware of that . # PM: You wanna go to this next slide , marketing expert ? # ME: , well I isn't this my last slide ? # ME: I think that was my last slide , . # ME: And I'm supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard . # ME: and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now , so if you put my last slide back up there . # ME: I'm sorry I've forgot to do that , . # PM: Why ? Wh why you need that up ? # ME: Well because I can't remember what I put on there . # ME: Now I'm supposed to see how long my leash is here . # PM: I think you can make it there . # ME: So now we're all supposed to say what we think . # ME: okay so on shape I gave it a one . # ME: Wait what would you ra one being good and seven being the worst . # ME: what do you think the shape is ? # ME: One , okay , and Be Betsy ? # PM: Yes I think shape is one . # ID: , even my , shape is one . # ME: uh-huh one , okay . # ME: And how about on size ? # PM: You you gave it a four . # ME: I gave it a four , I feel it's just average . # PM: I think I would give it at least a two . # ID: , even I think it is one . # ID: It's quite small . # ME: you're the designer , of course you wanna give it a one . # ME: and then how about how we doing on colour ? # ME: Colour , I gave it a one . # ME: I really like all those nice bright , warm colours . # PM: I like the colours . One . # ME: One , one , one , okay . # ME: And how about the feel ? # ME: Taking into consideration texture and comfort in the hand . # PM: , I think I would give it a two . # ME: I gave it a three , # UI: I'll give three . # ME: And the next is functionality where I admit I was a little hard on our team here , but # PM: Well it's also you can't really try it out the other things you have more is are more tangible so from that point of view I'll give it a three . # ME: It looks like we've got ourselves a pretty good product . # ME: the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting . # ME: But otherwise I think we're ready to go to go with this product . # ME: Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ? # PM: Here is what we looking at satisfaction on for example room for creativity . # PM: Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy ? # UI: We can always improve , yes . # ID: Maybe we can , include some more buttons and # UI: Yes , features . # ID: We can make the buttons few buttons smaller . # ID: I think they are quite big , so I think I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . If we want to have more features than that . # ME: Well then again if we're gonna do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the speech . # ME: So that that's where we're gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons . # ID: , definitely , two mu mute buttons . # ME: And then maybe we can do something with the volume control . # ME: Maybe we can put that all on one button . # ME: and a couple of other th maybe comp consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that . # PM: Y al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget # PM: and that we still you know we probably can't , with this particular item , we probably can't just add a whole lot of more things . # PM: we need you know we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser . # PM: So th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ? # PM: , are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created ? # PM: I think personally I think I'm pretty happy . # ME: I'm pretty happy with it too , # ID: Even I'm happy . # ME: it's something I think I can market . # PM: and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ? # ME: I think you've done a good job , Miss leader . # UI: Yes , yes you've done a good job . # PM: And I think team work I think was very good , I think we really # ME: I d I do too I think we worked well together as a team , . # PM: And I think we are we happy with the means we used ? # PM: We used whiteboard , we didn't use digital p well digital pens I guess are these things . # ME: maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more , # UI: Whiteboard more , yes , yes . # ME: we didn't use that enough . # PM: , it's maybe not in the best position in the room you know like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody and I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit . # ME: And we used the slide because it was better positioned . # PM: Yes , I think so , I think absolutely , # ME: Mm I think that's true . # PM: and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier . # PM: did we new did we find new ideas ? # PM: I think we did . # ME: I think we were we were very good , mm . # PM: I think we did , in more than one respect and so I think we did very well here . # PM: Are the costs within budget ? # PM: is the project evaluated ? # PM: then celebration . # ME: Celebration . # UI: Cel celebration yes , yes . # ME: Today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of 'em we have champagne . # PM: So I thank you all very much . # PM: , I think this was very good I think we did come up with a new product that's feasible . # PM: Feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view . # ID: Thank you very much . # ME: Watch I have my cord behind you here . # PM: I always get it on here , but getting it off is # ID: Do we do we have some time left ? # UI: They say it's forty minutes . # PM: yes we have time later # ME: But we were told we could end the final meeting at any time , whenever we felt we were finished . # ME: It'll take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace . # ME: Oh , there we go .
# PM: good morning . # PM: I see you all find your places . # PM: Is everybody sitting on the right place ? # PM: First I will introduce myself . # PM: I don't know if everybody knows me , I'm Bart , # ME: My name's Frank . # PM: let's start off with a little presentation . # PM: Now first I'll tell you a little bit about the setting . # PM: You can see there are a few cameras here . # PM: They'll record our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice . # PM: there are also some microphones there but th you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those , because it will disappear when you don't attend to it . # PM: is there a project documents folder ? # PM: There are some notes in it already I see , some documents . # PM: I'll start with the presentation kick off . # PM: Is being modified by the administrator . # ME: , that's interesting . # PM: Let's do it read only . # PM: I don't know if you've noticed , but we're working for Real Reaction . # PM: it's a company in electronics . # PM: We put fashion in electronics , we make it work , we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself . # PM: I'm Bart the project manager so I'll direct you through the project . # PM: This is our agenda . # PM: we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing . # PM: maybe I can sit down , then I can take some notes Let's see . # PM: Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while . # PM: I dunno it's not a lot of work , but just if you hear something you can write down , just write it down . # PM: as you can see it's the opening , aquaintance tool training . # PM: Aquaintance is a point we've done a bit . # PM: have you all seen the corporate website already ? # PM: Have you seen any flaws in it ? # PM: I think I found one . # ME: Can't say I paid much attention to it , # PM: I can see if it works this way . # PM: No , it doesn't work here . # PM: Okay no problem . # PM: But on the corporate information side there's a th there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction . # PM: Real Remote is not really the company we're we are , but it's just a little fault . # PM: what are we going to do ? # PM: our project aim is as you can see a new remote control . # PM: It has to be original , trendy , and user friendly . # PM: So these are the points why we also hired you . # PM: We've got the Marketing Expert for the trendy and user friendly look . # PM: And Industrial Designer there's also user friendly and a bit original . # PM: And we've got our User Interface Designer . # PM: He's also That's about the new remote control . # PM: project method is there are three phases we are going through . # PM: First is functional des design , individual work , meetings . # PM: After the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design . # PM: I had some role indications on here . # PM: But I think you know it already by yourself . # PM: The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design , components design and a bit of the look and feel design . # PM: the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design . # PM: And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project product ev evaluation . # PM: So that's a bit what you're going to do . # PM: But that will be all worked out in other meetings . # PM: Then we've got our first tool training . # PM: We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here , so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first . # PM: As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board . # PM: in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side . # PM: Here are some functions . # PM: these functions we don't have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little piece of drawing . # PM: A blank new document for each person . # PM: select a pen , eraser . # PM: Capture we don't have to do anything with . # PM: then we've got our pen . This pen . # PM: It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page in the think it is form of . # PM: You can also select the current colour and the line width . # PM: But then first you have to select the pen function . # PM: But we're going to work with it in a minute . # PM: that's very simple and it's easy to draw your findings and drawings on there . # PM: then a short thing about documents . # PM: We've got our shared folder , project what was it ? # PM: Project documents I think . # PM: But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already , so it will be okay . # PM: And these are available on the smart boards as well , so if you have a document you wanna show , just open it from the folder . # PM: Here is a simple tool bar . # PM: It's what I just said , it's save , print , move back or forward one page . # PM: You can switch between the different drawings . # PM: And then we're going to try out the white board . # PM: as you can see we g all going to draw a animal . Just to uh just to get a bit familiar with it . # PM: Mouse wasn't running away . # ME: That was interesting . # PM: Is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse ? # PM: We're going to draw animal . # PM: And just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics . # PM: the only thing we have to look after is that we use different colours , and different line width . # PM: there's I can start from now . I will . # PM: You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child . # PM: Because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing won't get good . # PM: Another thing is you have to be a bit slow . # PM: 'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then the pen won't hold up . # PM: we choose form of current colour I think grey is appropriate . # PM: Then the line width . # PM: I think seven will be nice . # PM: Now you'll see my drawing capabilities . # PM: These are not very much , you have to do it real slow . # PM: I was trying to draw a dolphin , but I think his nose has to be a little bit But it's close . # ME: I'm thinking about a swordfish . # PM: So what it's this is bit of the swordfish . # PM: he hasn't got an eye . # PM: Now we've got another function . # PM: We've got the eraser . # PM: And then you can undo this easily . # PM: And I've got to write down a few of its characteristics . # PM: They've got no text tool , no . # PM: This is typically a undo action , I think . # PM: Maybe you have to hold it a bit upside-down . # PM: I think that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe . # PM: But I don't know , I'm just trying . # PM: This is not my work , Maybe you have to use . I think it's a it wants to draw a another animal ? # PM: It lives for the fun . # PM: It's my characteristic about the dolphin . It lives for the fun . # PM: now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you . # ME: Gonna use a different line width . # ME: And I'm gonna draw in black . # ME: I'm not much of an artist , but here we go . # PM: Maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width , I think . # PM: Because this is going a lot better than I did . # ME: With of course little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts . # PM: It's a real dead sheep , For recognition , maybe you can also write your name somewhere . # ME: They are Come on . # ME: You have to go really slow when you're writing . # ME: They're brilliant animal animals . # ME: And that's just a little me thingy . # ME: Guess I'll pass the pen to our User Interface Designer . # UI: I'm just gonna draw its head , Let's see . # ME: Interesting . # UI: You know what that is ? # UI: That's enough . # UI: you say a blank , # PM: , just a blank sheet . # ID: I was gonna draw a cat too , I'll just try something else . # ID: Something different than Garfield . # ID: Mine is a bit more skinny . # PM: it's pretty skinny cat . # ME: And the most interesting tail . # PM: Is your cat , or did you find him on the street ? # ID: it's supposed to be a cat . # ID: I like cats because they are independent . # PM: That's pretty clear . # PM: everybody knows how to work with the white board now ? # PM: if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board , just ask # PM: It's pretty easy . # ME: We're being haunted . # PM: haunted white board . # PM: we've got the tool introduction . # PM: move along to the project finance . # PM: as you can see , we for our remote control , a selling price is twenty five Euros . Our selling price . # PM: our profit aim is fifty million Euros . # PM: that's the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims . # PM: we can do it international , so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well . # PM: but that's all in the later stadium . # PM: Our production cost can be maximal twelve and a half Euros , so that's also a point we have to keep in mind , that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside , and stuff like that . # PM: just try to remember these points . Selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million , but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on . And production cost maximal twelve and a half Euros . # PM: that's leads us to our little discussion . # PM: We've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion . # PM: I'm gonna sit down , I think . # ME: you got a message . # PM: I've got a message . # PM: Five minutes . # UI: Five minutes , okay . # PM: that's good timing . # ME: just on a side note , why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen ? # PM: maybe you have to say the magic word . # PM: Does it do anything ? # PM: Maybe you have to just clap it down ? Mm back up again . # PM: No slide show . # PM: Now you have to put it back o You'll be okay , I think . # PM: it's those laptops . # PM: Okay . But so mm does everybody has experiences with remote controls , and I mean not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ? Like you can use for other ? # ID: No , me neither . # ME: we have a kind of broad T_V_ at home , and a D_V_D_ player , so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the T_V_ , one for the video recorder , one for the D_V_D_ player . # ME: And I think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all . # PM: I've got one at home . # PM: And you can program I think eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else . # PM: And it also operates on infra-red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor . # PM: So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or D_V_D_ player downstairs and you've got a link to your T_V_ on the second floor . So that's a pretty handy # PM: but only the I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as well . # PM: That's good to remember . # ME: I think you can take minutes again . # PM: that's nice , I think . # ME: Since it's your job . # PM: we've we want different functions and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red . # PM: But I don't know if that will exceed the production costs . # PM: So that that's something we have to find out , I think . # ME: But that would be really good if we could do that . # PM: And other functions for a remote control ? # PM: Maybe we can make it uh # ME: Think it has to be shock proof # ME: my remote control tends to fall a lot . # UI: Waterproof , you never no know , I w I mean # PM: Okay . So these are our a few things we can think of . # PM: I will put the minutes from this meeting in our project folder . # ME: one other little thing . # ME: Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it . # ME: So you can see # PM: battery stays . # ME: how much is left in the battery . # ME: But they'll also really drag up the production costs , so think we'll have to see about that too . # ME: But maybe just a little LED , I don't know . # PM: That's an idea as well . # PM: Other ideas ? Quick ideas . # ID: They were all mentioned , # PM: Any questions about this presentation ? Kick off presentation . # ME: Nope , don't think so . # PM: then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder , and then we can all work . # PM: Finish meeting now . # PM: And we can all work on our own projects . # PM: then I'll meet you in about a half an hour , I think .
# PM: Everybody found his place again ? # PM: Okay so this is our second meeting . # PM: still failing ? # PM: now we're going into the functional design . # PM: important thing of this phase is that we're going to try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design . So that we can move onto the second phase . # PM: But first this phase . # PM: first an announcement . # PM: There's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system . # PM: There's our ghost mouse again . # PM: That that means that you can have a little trouble with , little trouble with the air conditioning , that's because of this It's in wing C_ and E_ . # PM: it should be over in a in a while , couple of days . # PM: But it's going to be cold anyway , so I don't think you're gonna need it . # PM: Then our agenda . # PM: first the opening . # PM: this time I will take the minutes . # PM: you're going to have a presentation . All of you . # PM: and we've got forty minutes for the whole prese for the whole presentations . # PM: So I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements which have been sent to me . # PM: And then the decision on the control functions which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include . # PM: we've got forty minutes for all of it . # PM: I suggest let's start with the first presentation . # PM: who wants to be first ? # ME: Think I'll go first . # PM: Just maybe it's easier if you I think you will tell your presentation as well . Just which function you have and what you're gonna talk about . # ME: My name is Freek Van Ponnen . # ME: I'm the Market Expert . # ME: But you already knew that . # ME: I've done some research . # ME: We have we have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed users operating remote controls . # ME: we let them fill out a questionnaire . # ME: We had one hundred of these test subjects . # ME: in addition we did some market research . see what the market consists of . What ages are involved . # ME: these are three quite astonishing results , I thought . # ME: remotes are being considered ugly . # ME: seventy five percent of the people questioned indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . # ME: and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control . # ME: in addition remotes were not very functional . # ME: Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . # ME: And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . # ME: Then we did some research to the most relevant functions . # ME: Channel selection and volume selection both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . # ME: The power button got a nine . # ME: And teletext got a six and a half . # ME: So these are the most important functions on a remote control . # ME: Then there are some one-time use function . # ME: That's what I like to call them . # ME: That audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . # ME: Which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance . # ME: channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . One hundred and sixty eight times per hour . # ME: Then these are the This is the market . # ME: sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . # ME: Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control . # ME: they like to use new f new functions . # ME: But they also are very critical . # ME: They won't spend their money very easily . # ME: the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market . # ME: They are not really very interested in features . # ME: But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . # ME: What I think this indicates for our design . I think we should make a remote for the future . # ME: And this means we would have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . # ME: this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . # ME: this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . # ME: The results also indicated that about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused R_S_ R_S_I_ . # ME: this is certainly something to take into account . # ME: And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . # ME: So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design . # ME: Besides of course that the remote must look very nice . # ME: And the functionality As a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , I think we should make very few buttons . # ME: this will also be beneficial to the design of the remote . # ME: I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . Especially the channel selection and audio selection buttons . # ME: 'Cause they're used most and so they should be robust . # ME: They shouldn't break down easily . # ME: Then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their remote got lost in the room , it might be and I say might be because it would certainly boost the production costs a lot . # ME: But it might be a good idea to make a docking station . # ME: And this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep . # ME: So you'd know where it is in the room . # ME: And in addition to this it could recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . # ME: Then a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred . # ME: This was mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . # ME: But up till forty five it remains feasible . # ME: This would also greatly increase the production costs but I think these are just some small factors we could consider . # ME: That would be all . # PM: anybody have any questions until now ? # ME: Any questions ? # PM: About functional requirements ? # PM: Now to the second . # UI: I've been looking at the user interface of it . f for the techno f functions of it . # PM: you can take your time . # PM: We've got plenty of time , # ME: you should go to the top thingy . Slide show . # UI: I think we must use the general functions of the remote control . # UI: I've do I've done a little research on the internet and not much information about it , about interface I I've been thinking about a simple manner to put a lot of functions uh in one in one remote control . # UI: so you've got a lot of devi devices like D_V_D_ uh television , stereo . # UI: But it must be user-friendly . # UI: you c you can't put a lot of functions in one . uh . In one remote control . # UI: Got many functions in one remote control , you can see , this is quite simple remote control . # UI: few buttons but This re remote control got a lot of buttons . # UI: people don't like it , what I was thinking about was keep the general functions like they are . # UI: like the on-off button . keep it l like a red button . # UI: everybody knows it so uh you don't have to change that . # UI: My personal preferences . # UI: Use a display for specific functions of the different device . # UI: Wh what I was th thinking about was you've got this the remote control and you got here the general functions , like the on-off button sound I dunno And here you've got a s kind of a display . # UI: It's a touchscreen . # UI: you got a general f the functions of the device for a D_V_D_ player or so the pl f for playing reverse . # UI: And you got here real buttons for selecting a device . # UI: this button is for a D_V_D_ for every device you've got a f a b a part display of a part buttons . # UI: you never got all the buttons on w one device . # UI: that's my idea about it . # UI: let's see . So a touchscreen . # UI: and th the buttons the real buttons we have to use . # UI: We better c use quite large buttons Everybody have to use it so ol even old people young people . # UI: we must keep buttons quite s simple and quite large . # UI: That was my part of it . # PM: Anybody has questions about the technical functions ? # ID: I think if we are gonna use a touchscreen we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros . # UI: N I don't think so . # UI: you got quite a cheap touchscreen . S it's not in colour or something . # PM: Touchscreen . # UI: it's just one colo I seen w something on the internet not today but a few weeks ago . # UI: you got quite an a kind of touchscreen and it's for twenty Euros or less . # UI: So it's possible . # PM: 'Kay . That's nice . # ME: it would certainly make a fancy design . # ID: But the It wouldn't be very robust . # ID: It's very fragile and you can get scratches on it . # PM: maybe we can first listen to your presentation ? # ME: We would have to look into that . # PM: And then we have a little discussion about the requirements and design . # PM: I think it's going to it's not too much . # ID: I've got a presentation about the working design . # ID: first about how it works . # ID: It's really simple of course . # ID: Everybody knows how a remote works . # ID: The user presses a button . # ID: The remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_ . # ID: The T_V_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . # ID: we've got the plate . # ID: It gots conductive disks for every button . # ID: When the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the LED and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_ . # ID: It's a very simple device , technically speaking . # ID: this is a schematic overview . # ID: You've got the buttons . # ID: The power source . # ID: And when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . # ID: The chip controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . # ID: When you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . # ID: I think we should use default materials , simple plastics . # ID: Keep the inner workings simple , so it's robust . # ID: I think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high . # ID: And you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product . # ID: it's , in my idea , it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in the product itself . # PM: now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now . # PM: I'm the Project Manager so I'm here to mess things up and tell you some new requirements . # PM: we've got to design a remote which is only suitable for T_V_ . # PM: that's because it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it for more functions . # PM: So it has to be simple . # PM: another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of upcoming internet we think teletext is going to be a thing of the past . # PM: And it's a function we don't need in our remote control . # PM: internet is also mentioned in a function we can use . # PM: maybe also on televisions it will be available as well . # PM: Another one is the customer is forty plus . that's the market we have to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . # PM: this is a bit pity for the Marketing Expert . # PM: Because he was aiming on the younger persons . # PM: So we have to find a market which is above forty plus but which will suit our remote control , and the other way round . # PM: And we have to be very attent in putting the corporate image in our product . # PM: So it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . # PM: And we have to be very clear on this point as well . # PM: I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions . # ME: is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ? # PM: we can see if we can find a way between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product . # ME: 'cause you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it's not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon . # ME: And new T_V_s will have internet access on them . # ME: But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim . # ME: In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . # ME: So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . # ME: I'm pretty much against it . # PM: Against the no teletext ? # ME: Besides that , I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small . # ME: But I mean if I s if I see this , it's I think we're just gonna go for another # PM: it's it is Standard remote . # PM: I think we can # ME: and not innovative # PM: I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons # ME: remote control . # PM: which were also mentioned . # PM: if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with just two or three buttons . Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market . # PM: if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it's the biggest share of the of the whole population now . # ME: but it's not the biggest part of the market . # ME: And besides that , they're not very critical I mean they don't really care what the remote control is like . # ME: They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable . # PM: But don't you think that if we make a remote which is typically made for this market , that people think the people think that's the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it . # ME: I think that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category . # ME: because they are critical and they want to have a fancy remote control . # ME: People of forty plus , I mean they want it to work , but as soo as soon as it works it's okay with them . # ID: I think that if we're If we put our marketing right we can sell this just like I don't know if you've heard about it in the news , the elderly mobile phone ? # PM: It's a big success . # ID: if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , I think . # PM: Very big success . # ME: I haven't heard of it . # PM: I think so as well . # ID: We don't have to focus on the on the design then but on functionality . # ID: We just change our focus on the project , and I think we can we can sell this . # PM: I simply think that the new products we are gonna make , spef specifically design , are designed for younger people , so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people . # PM: And I think we have to see what requirements we need for those remote controls . # PM: 'Cause what you told is the channel selection is important . Volume selection , power and teletext . # ME: But obviously the board tends to disagree . # PM: we haven't voted yet , I think teletext can be can be a function as well . But only if it won't higher the cost , because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well , but I don't think it will be a problem . # PM: Or is teletext a # UI: But deaf people need teletext for subtitles . # ME: I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext . # PM: Is anybody really against teletext ? # PM: Just that , that we just keep the teletext . # PM: I think that's a good idea as well , especially for the subtitles . # PM: Maybe we can make that another point of advantage in our remote control , if we make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control . # PM: For elderly people they can think , oh I wanna have subtitles , and they push the button and they get the big subtitles . # ID: that's a good idea . # PM: I think teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage . # PM: Functionality should be few buttons , you said . # PM: I think that's very important we have a few buttons . # PM: So to keep it simple . # ME: But I don't think that's really an issue any more might be . # UI: If it's only for televi # ME: But I mean it , if it's only for T_V_ you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway . # ME: You need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel , volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons # PM: But do you need # UI: So we can s we can skip the display , # ME: I think if you if you only l # UI: so we don't need it . # PM: But do you need the buttons for one to zero . # PM: Maybe c we can # ME: Think if you're gonna include teletext you do . # ME: I think many people like to use that . # PM: Maybe we can use # ME: 'Cause if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times . # PM: maybe we can implement the scroll button ? # PM: Or a joystick like ? # PM: There are other ways too . # PM: Just look if you look at telephones . The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or # ME: That's true but I don't think there are many T_V_s that can switch channels that fast . # ME: And so you would need like the T_V_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . # ME: And I dunno if many channels would do have that . If many T_V_s have that . # ID: And besides that it's If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt . # ID: They're not used to using scroll buttons . # ID: So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout . # PM: they can see how much buttons there are going to be on the display , and if it's too much we can reconsider it . # PM: But I think there won't be very much buttons . # PM: Or there don't have to be a lot . # ME: But I don't think I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_ , you there's not much you can gain on having as few buttons as possible . # ME: 'Cause I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a T_V_ , which already only have the minimum number of buttons . # ME: I don't think there's much to be gained in that area . # PM: The number of buttons ? # PM: I think it's very important in the in the design . # PM: You can make a very fancy design with putting the buttons on the right places . # PM: And if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with # ME: That is true but I think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the T_V_ . # PM: To operate only the T_V_ . # ME: 'Cause if you have a remote control only to operate a T_V_ there's simply not a lot of buttons required . # ME: There's not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either . # ME: I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here . # ME: That would that would cost a big marketing expedition # ME: which was one of the arguments to make it only for the T_V_ because we didn't have the time to market a lot . # PM: you suggest we could better focus on for example the docking station . # PM: like other functions . Instead of f of less buttons . # ME: I think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons But I don't think we should spend very much time in that . # PM: Do you think the docking station will is allowed in the budget we have ? # ID: It should be possible yes . If it's not too fancy . # PM: 'Cause it can be # ID: And if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible # PM: Because I think that's That's a good advantage point as well . If we have a fancy-looking docking station or very That's a nice requirement . # PM: Docking station . # ID: we're just gonna focus on the extras ? # ME: I think maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a like to have extra in a new remote control . # PM: That's a good point . # PM: You said they easily get lost as well . # ME: fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost . # PM: So maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something . # ME: that was what I suggested . # ID: Like with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes it makes a sound . # ME: You have it on you have it's on some phones too , which have a docking station . # ME: And you just press a button and the phone goes ringing . # ME: So you know where it is . # PM: audio signal should be possible as well . # PM: I think it's not too expensive . # PM: another point is the L_C_D_ screen . # PM: I don't know if that will rise the cost too much , because # ID: I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen , # PM: It will be too much as well . # ME: I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . # ME: Which would tell you what it does . # ME: And it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen , # PM: Oh just the normal screen . # ME: Just a small screen # PM: That's a good idea . # PM: Some extra info . Feedback . # PM: I think that's a good idea as well . # ME: But I dunno if that would # PM: As the small screen . # ME: that would fit into the costs . # PM: Extra button info . # PM: I think that should be possible as well . # PM: let's see what did we say . Mm . More . # PM: Should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . # PM: Few buttons , we talked about that . Docking station , L_C_D_ . general functions And default materials . I think that's a good idea as well , because elderly people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one . # PM: So that doesn't really matter . # PM: I think we nee # ME: I think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters . # PM: let's specify the target group . # PM: Because are we talking about elderly people or people from forty to eighty . # PM: Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe . # PM: what do we want ? # PM: If we want a with for example the telephone for elderly people , we can # PM: target the real elderly people . # ME: I think that would be a If we should do something like that it would be a , I think it would be really good for the image of the company . # ME: And I think , I think there would be a good market for it . # ME: If we're able to really bring an innovative product . # PM: Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example . # ME: the really But I'd have to look into that a little more . # PM: And different cultures . Are we # ID: I don't think they have different television sets in every country . # PM: We've got five minutes left just now . # PM: Small warning . # ME: And with the little screen in it , which explains the buttons . You could I think we n it would be a lot easier to # ME: adapt it to different cultures . # PM: In different languages , you know . # PM: or you have to put a language button in it , but that will be a bit unnecessary I think . # PM: It's better to put it on different markets with it all . # PM: Okay . So that's the target . # PM: then a few small things . # PM: I will put the minutes in the project document folder . # PM: what we're going to do for the next meeting is the Industrial Designer will do the components concept , User Interface Designer the user interface concept , and the trend-watching . # PM: just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group , requirements , and the trends which are going on . # PM: And specific instructions will be sent to you by the personal coach . # PM: I thank you for this meeting . # PM: And I think we have a lunch-break now . # PM: that's a good thing .
# PM: good afternoon . # PM: This is our third meeting already . # ME: Good afternoon . # PM: I hope you enjoyed your lunch . # PM: Presentation three . # PM: this is the second phase we're going to discuss today . # PM: It's the conceptual design meeting . # PM: And a few points of interest in this meeting are the conceptual specification of components . conceptual specification of design . And also trend-watching . # PM: these are hopefully the points you addressed in your pre presentations you're going to show me in a few minutes . # PM: but first I'll show you the agenda . # PM: first the opening . # PM: Then we have three presentations . # PM: after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . # PM: How we're going to make it . # PM: And then we're closing . # PM: We have about forty minutes . # PM: so I suggest let's get started . # PM: did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ? # PM: Everything fine ? # PM: Then a little thing about the last meeting . # PM: these are the points we agreed on . The requirements and the target market . # PM: requirements are teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that button information . # PM: And we are going to use default materials . # PM: does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? Maybe ? # PM: These are just the things we thought of , so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . # PM: And maybe we can work it out . # PM: And we're going to target sixty to eighty year old customers . # PM: now everybody knows what we're do we're doing , I suggest let's get started with the presentations . # PM: shall we keep the same line-up as last time ? # ME: I'll start off then . # ME: I'm gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days . # ME: we've done some market research . # ME: We distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . # ME: And besides that I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends . # ME: And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the best design would be . # ME: these are some overall findings . # ME: most important thing is the fancy design . # ME: the research indicated that was by far the most important factor . # ME: innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . # ME: By innovativeness this means functions which are not featured in other remote controls . # ME: about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . # ME: for our group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is , these factors are slightly more equal . # ME: these are some more group specific findings . # ME: the older people prefer dark colours . # ME: they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . # ME: And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people . # ME: this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about the look-and-feel that the remote should have . # ME: this leads us to some personal preferences . # ME: the remote control and the docking station should blend in the in the room . # ME: so this would mean no eye-catching designs . # ME: Just keep it simple the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the These would be the innovativeness in the remote control . # ME: So this would be very important that we at least include these features . # ME: well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . # ME: So you could imagine that the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . # ME: This is not really This is pretty much a new shape to older people . # ME: So they would prefer a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . # ME: So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . # ME: besides that we would advise to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . # ME: The wood-like for the more exclusive people . People with more money . # ME: the grey-black colour for well people with less means . # ME: That would be all . # PM: Any questions about the trends ? # ME: Any questions ? # PM: we go on to the next one . # UI: some research a about designing of an interface . # UI: the last meeting we had a about using a f few buttons . # UI: that's w what I what I want to uh to do in our design . # UI: finding an attractive way to control the remote control . the I found some something about speech recognition . # UI: maybe we can use that . # UI: and using a little display . # UI: just we have just to focus on the primary functions . # UI: only buttons for sound , for on-off , shifting u up sa ca channel or down shifting down . # UI: let's see . and we need some new a attractive functions uh which attract uh people for using it . # UI: it's like a speak speech recognition and a special button for selecting subtitles . # UI: Just what we mentioned last meeting . # UI: overall user-friendly . # UI: using large buttons . # UI: It's possible to uh to make quite cheap system for speech recognition . # UI: you can think about when you lost your remote control , you can call it and it gives an sig signal . # UI: And and for shifting up a sen c ch channel or for putting out sound or something , you can just give a sign say sound off or A and Television put the sound off put the sound off . # UI: I was thinking about the special button for subtitles , just one button to keep it simple . # UI: one push on the button you get uh small subtitles . # UI: double push , if double click , so you get big subtitles , for people uh which c f who can't read small subtitles . # UI: and w we have to keep in general buttons we've got the buttons we have to use . The on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , the numbers , zero to uh nine . the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down channel . # UI: also we want to use a little d display for displaying the functions of the buttons . # UI: And we can build in a function f which shows the channel or some which the t television is on . # UI: made a little picture of it . # UI: Just we can put the on-off button over in this corner , almost e all remote controls are using a on-off button on that place . # UI: so people will recognise the button . # UI: D display of it , it's just a small display . # UI: you can put it on top . # UI: it's most uh place where people , most of looks at . # UI: and a special button for shifting up and shifting down channel , it's on place where the thumb of the So you can easily shift up or shift down . # UI: it's quite handy place . # UI: all the f functions for subtitle one button , for sound and for our design , we have to discuss about it I think so the form of it And that's it . # ID: About the components design . # ID: for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . # ID: But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . # ID: So I don't think it's really an option . # ID: for the casing , the manufacturing department can deliver a flat casing , single or double curved casing . # ID: It's really up the design that we're gonna use . # ID: It's doesn't imply any technical restrictions . # ID: as a case supplement , we could , I thought of that l later , a rubber belt , like a anti-slip . # ID: for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . # ID: And the chip-set , it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we're using an L_C_D_ screen . # ID: And as the trend-watcher presentation showed , people like wood , but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . # ID: Form should follow function overall . # ID: well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . # ID: But depends on what we want . # ID: I think we should disc discuss that . # ID: for the case , the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . # ID: And the chip-set really should be advanced because otherwise it would really be a simple remote control . # PM: that brings us to the discussion about our concepts . # PM: these are the points we have to discuss . # PM: first I think we can talk about the energy source , since that's has a pretty big influence on production price , and image . # PM: f I think first of all we have to see it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , I think . # ID: there are four options . # ID: We could use the basic normal battery . # ID: a hand dynamo . # ID: But I don't think that's really an option . # ID: You don't wanna swing before you can watch television . # ID: But not every room is very light so it's not a very good option . # ID: Or the kinetic energy . # ME: And how exactly does the kinetic energy work ? # ID: y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up . # ME: You just You use it and it works . # ME: personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it . # ME: And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . # ME: And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can get great popularity for our product . # UI: what's the function ? # UI: f for loading up the batteries # ME: you could load up the batteries , you could insert the find the lost remote control function in there . # UI: but it won't use much e energy I believe . # UI: it's just a small display so I believe it will run on one battery for six months or f or more . # UI: So I believe one battery is just enough . # PM: I think elderly people just like to have everything in place . # PM: And I don't think they like remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . # PM: So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place . # PM: And also what you said . you can introduce voice recognition by finding back your remote . # PM: But I think it's more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . # PM: So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . # PM: And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the channels . # ME: I'm wondering what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ? # PM: That's a good point . # ID: Mm I don't have any information on pricing . # ID: So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department . # ME: 'Cause in our earlier market research , if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , SMARTboard . # PM: , sure . Go ahead . # ME: it was open here . # ME: we also asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . # ME: you can see here , our target group would not do that . # ME: So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control I would greatly advise not to do it . # ME: I think that would be better to insert in our other product , that is meant for the younger people . # ID: But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess . # ID: It's a bit higher percentage , # ME: this is but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . # ME: So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it . # ME: And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would help in making the remote control easier to use . # ME: And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use . # PM: Easier to use ? # PM: I think that's a good point . # UI: But is our research about bi large L_C_D_ sh display , or just a small one we want to use ? # ME: this was for like an L_C_D_ screen like you would have on a on the most advanced mobile phones . # ME: So pretty large . # PM: I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it . # PM: Because it's just some extra information , and it's easy to ignore as well . # PM: So if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it . # PM: I think the Maybe we have to discard the voice recognition . # PM: Because it will increase cost signifi significantly . # PM: And I don't think the I don't think it will be a lot easier to use , as well . # PM: that brings us back to the energy . # PM: If we don't have the voice recognition , it will it won't use a lot of energy to use . # PM: in that case we could use kinetic energy , but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . # PM: And much cheaper as well . # ID: And that's the best choice . # PM: let me just choose for the battery . # PM: That brings us to the chip . # ID: there isn't any choice there because we're using the display . # PM: Just the advanced . # ID: So it's gotta be advanced . # PM: , advanced chip . # PM: And then we get to the point of the case . # PM: which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well . # PM: if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . Or both ? # PM: as we saw there is not wood is a lot more expensive to produce . # PM: but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids . # PM: Look I've got a new remote control , and # ME: And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour . # ME: So it wouldn't actually have to be wood , # ME: if it's just wood-coloured . # PM: But with colour was a lot more expensive ? Or ? # PM: You don't know ? # ID: I'll have to research . # PM: I think so because # PM: It's a lot more difficult to handle and to get in the right shape . # UI: is it possible to make changeable case . # UI: you 'cause with mobile phones uh so like the Nokia mobile phones , when you can change the case of it . # PM: Change the cases . # UI: maybe it's possible possibility . # UI: you have just to make one standard remote control , and you can sell few # PM: You can sell the cases . # PM: I think that's a very good option . # PM: Because then you can advertise as well with the Give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever . # PM: Because that's a it's something extra , it's something other remotes don't have , which we can get a great advantage point . # PM: and then you can make them with colour . Black and grey , other colours as well . # ME: We would have to look carefully into the design though . # ME: 'Cause we would have to make one w control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . The more original one , or the more standard one . # ME: So that would # PM: you suggest we should design two different telephones on which you can apply , remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example . # ME: I wouldn't design a telephone I think w we should just , we should then just design one # ME: one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one . # ME: but that shouldn't be too much of a problem . # PM: everybody's okay with the changing covers ? # PM: I think that's a good option . # PM: Changing case covers . # ME: I heard our Industrial Designer talk about flat , single and double curved . # ME: Could you explain that a little more ? # ID: the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . # ID: And our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases . # ME: And what would single curved and double curved mean ? # ID: it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know . # ID: it's j really just up to the design department what we're gonna use . # ID: It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality . # ME: we can pretty much just do whatever we want . # ID: Pick one you like , # PM: but the form has to be It has to It's has to be possible to stand up ? # PM: Or just only to lie down ? # ME: just to lie down . # PM: And the cover of the docking station is also # ME: We'll go for that . # PM: on top of the television then ? Or not ? # ME: or besides it . # PM: And you can just then click it in . # PM: the interface . What type of interface do we want to use ? # PM: maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the on the board . # PM: Does somebody have ideas for a form # UI: we can just use the regular form of it , but it's not quite fancy . # ME: you said you wanted to put the changing channels button on the right side , so you could , so your thumb would be easily I think that was a very good point 'cause I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause R_S_I_ . # ME: So that would be great for that . # ME: I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side . # ME: For left-handed users also . # UI: Is it possible to program it s so you got on the left side or on the right side buttons for shifting u up and shifting up ? And on the other o other side buttons for shifting , for the sound ? # ME: For the volume . # ME: that could we could do that but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use . # PM: Usabili ease of use will be a lot more difficult , and then it's # ME: But if we would make a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote . # ME: 'Cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff . # PM: But you have extra buttons . # PM: So people can get confused . # PM: Especially if they have the same writings on it . # UI: Or we have to make a left For lefties # PM: Can't we make Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same functions as the normal one ? # PM: Then you have to Let's see if I ca A blank one . # PM: And then you get Here's a little L_C_D_ screen . # PM: now I have to think . # PM: It's a plus and a min . # PM: No it's not very handy I think . # PM: Because the plus and the min will be opposite and all kinds of No that's not gonna work . I guess . # PM: Maybe we should But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand ? # PM: I think the functions are that basic that nobody should have any problems with choosing a channel # UI: It's just u using your thumb . # PM: I think we could just leave it a normal shape . # PM: but maybe we have to make it a l a bit more fancy . In one or ano another way . # ID: I think we should start by choosing a case . # ID: Because that's the basis you're building on . # ID: I could draw them out . # ID: Let's look at the flat case . # ID: It's from the side so it's rather normal . # ID: The the single curved so I'm not really sure what they're gonna look like , but I think it's something like this . # ID: this type should be better for you or better Should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit . # ID: And the double curved s looks something like this I guess . # ID: th those are the three options we have . # PM: I suggest the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the screen in . # PM: so that elderly people can use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it's a bit , it has a bit of a angle . # UI: Do you say this you got like sort of a I believe There ? # UI: you want to put a display over here ? Or not ? # UI: we can make it # PM: Do you have it upside down Do you have it # UI: That's the top . # PM: this that's top ? Okay . # UI: maybe it's possible to make this side like Let's see . # UI: Colour to make this side like mm the right colour . # UI: bit like so in the form of your hand . # UI: the remote control have to lay in your hand . # UI: it's possib for s so and # PM: get your mouse . # UI: And to put the buttons for changing the channel over here # PM: That's a good one . # PM: But I think it's better to put the screen on top . # PM: just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get here . # UI: but this place # PM: If you can have this one , you turn it like this . # PM: And then flip it upside down . # PM: Because maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here . # ID: It's more logical to have it on top as well # ID: because , like on your mobile phone , it's always above . # ID: maybe you should just s start on a blank page . # PM: then we get That's the curve . # UI: Five minutes . # PM: Here the display , and then buttons . # PM: and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe . # PM: Just that's for left hand and right hand users . # PM: And then h the rest of the buttons over here . # UI: But the on-off button , still on the top # ME: And I'd prefer the corners to be round . # PM: Should be more bit more friendly , # ME: Think that would be better . # ME: Friendly on the eye . # PM: Supplements . That's okay . # PM: Where's my mouse ? # PM: Then We've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use . # PM: for the next meeting we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design . # PM: It's important that the corporate design image is going to be in the remote . # PM: So check out the corporate website maybe . # PM: The user interface design , it's the same story . # PM: And product evaluation . # PM: So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one . # PM: But you're going to get your instructions I think sended by the coach . # PM: just I will put these minutes on the in the folder . # PM: And then we're going to try to finish our project , and make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , I think . # PM: Which are let's see . # PM: I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first . # PM: And then you'll get a message . # PM: that's basically it . # PM: Maybe this one ? # PM: Then we can save this one in the folders group . # PM: SMARTboard , there it . # PM: if you wanna have a look at it , it's over there in the projects folder . # PM: And then I guess we'll start in thirty minutes again .
# ME: Good afternoon . # ME: Sorry I'm a little late . # ME: Got stuck in the traffic . # PM: That's possible on this time of day . # PM: Starts at three o'clock . # PM: Our fourth and last meeting . # PM: this our last meeting . # PM: In this meeting we will discuss our final design . # PM: And we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . # PM: And then we're going to close the project today as well . # PM: after this you will be free to go and spend all your money . # PM: And this design , detailed design meeting we will discuss the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . # PM: , in order to do that we have this agenda . # PM: We'll have the prototype presentation first . # PM: Then we will set up some evaluation cri criteria . # PM: Then we will look at the finance . # PM: we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . # PM: Because everything costs money , and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . # PM: So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote . # PM: But we will see that later . # PM: Then we will do the project evaluation , and the closing after that . # PM: We've got forty minutes . # PM: So we will be finished at half past three . # PM: But first we will do the this is prototype presentation . # PM: if some if somebody wants step forward . # ID: this is what me and Richard came up with . # ID: The default spot for the on-off button . # ID: The mute button just below that . # ID: Then there's the volume and channel selectors . # ID: Simple plus-minus button . # ID: we thought of a help button . # ID: If you hold it and you press another button , the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen . # ID: Then there's the zero to one to zero buttons . A button for teletext . A button for the subtitles . And the company logo . # ID: So it's rather simple prototype . # ID: And we'll have to see from testing how the users take it . # ME: , is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ? # ID: just pop in at any time . # ME: , when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page . # UI: , that's just the normal as th as the normal remote controls You put it you came in page one hundred . Now you can use the normal one to zero buttons . # UI: And you But you can also use the button th for changing the channel . S so the shifting button . for shif shifting up in on t on t teletext , and shifting down . So # PM: Okay . but I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh tried to keep it simple . just a few buttons and large buttons . # PM: But I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons . # PM: So I'm wondering if we if we neely really need all of those buttons . # ID: I think if you look at most controls , they've got more buttons than this . # ID: And well the on-off button , it's a necessity . # ID: You can't drop that one . # ID: The volume and channel buttons , you need you obviously need those . # ID: The mute button could be replaced by pressing the volume-down button twice . # ID: So we could cancel that one . # ID: I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does . # UI: , or you can build in when you press one button uh # UI: We disc discuss that already . # UI: But we think old people don't know that option . # UI: So they just put in put press the button and # ID: you can't leave out the number buttons I guess . # PM: teletext and subtitles are necessary . # ID: So it's rather basic already . # ME: That's what I pointed out earlier . # ME: If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here . # PM: Okay . So we had somebody about th interfa Something about the design of the buttons there ? # PM: Just n normal plain buttons . # ID: It's rather hard to draw on the white-board . # ID: But they're supposed to be equal sized , round , with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume , the triangle and stuff . # UI: Just to recognise it , # ID: Just for recognition . # UI: and now we don't need LEDs s some remote controls do it also , but because we use the little display we don't have to use it . # ID: and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons . With a different colour than the case . # ID: So they jump out . # ID: And that's about it . # PM: Then because we only have thirty minutes left , I will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it's all possible what we wanna do . # PM: And I can tell you that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros . # PM: If we see I don't know if I've filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see something wrong . # PM: I counted two batteries . # PM: But maybe we can also use one . # PM: I don't know if it's possible . # ME: Since it rechargeable . # PM: It's rechargeable . That's right . # PM: That's two Euros off . # PM: We need the advanced chip . # PM: So there's not much to save there . # PM: Here we have the single curves . # PM: we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro . , I don't know , but I think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . # PM: I think we have to keep that . # PM: Then we have the case material supplements . # PM: It's the cheapest one we need . # PM: So that's not much to save either . # PM: But then the biggest costs are the buttons . # PM: So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to keep our costs low . # PM: Because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end . , so if we Let's fir first count the buttons we have now . # UI: Sixteen , I believe so . # PM: Because I Sixteen . # PM: that will be even more then . # PM: Eighteen Euros . # UI: seventeen . with the help button . # PM: Okay , including the help ? # PM: I think we can discard the help and the mute button by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a number long . # PM: That saves us one Euro already . # PM: 'Cause then we have got fifteen I think ? # PM: Fifteen buttons . # ME: No . That wouldn't be an option . # ME: d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , # PM: No those are one , I think . # ME: think actually there're two buttons , # UI: , it's just one button . # UI: There were two for one big button . # UI: But they are more expensive than the small ones . # PM: but th it's not stated in this files . # PM: So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing # ME: I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button . # PM: That's possibility as well . # ME: That would cut the cost . # PM: And it's good for the design as well . # PM: So you can make let's see . # PM: If you make this Looks a bit like a cross . # UI: But I don't know if it's cheaper . # UI: we've still got four buttons , but just So # PM: th I think they count the materials . # UI: You got not a butt button itself , but on the # PM: on the chip there . # UI: On the chip you've got still four buttons . # PM: That's right . That's right . # PM: But I think because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button . # ME: But , I think this really is four buttons anyhow . # PM: but I think . Maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros . # PM: Also the L_C_ display , I think it's , I think it's too expensive for the display we use . # ID: that's a big cost . # PM: I think they try t # ID: If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip . # PM: That's right , but what's the big advantage of our remote then ? # ME: Only the docking station , I guess . # ID: Which isn't the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic . # ID: it's not even taken into the price . # PM: That's extra . That's extra . # ME: Maybe we should to a different supplier . # PM: That's an option . # PM: Poland . Something . Polish supplier . # PM: Don't you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th these buttons in three , then we save a lot of money as well . # ID: We we could save money on it . # ID: But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ? # ME: , that's what I'm wondering . # ID: My mother can't even send an S_M_S_ message . # PM: That's a point . # UI: Are we gonna buy a remote control when you can use it ? # UI: We m we must stay below the below twelve fifty or Can't go # ME: since the market research indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . # ME: Especially since we have those nice features . # PM: but we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros . # PM: We don't have any more budget to develop it . # UI: Is it impossible to # ID: The margin will get too small . # UI: But it is possible to make one for twelve fifty . # PM: It is . If you leave out the L_C_ display . And if you use less buttons . Say Or you can take the single chip . # UI: I don't think so . # ME: It would be a be a pretty rigid one . # UI: But , you can't use # PM: But then w Good looking . # UI: , wi with n Oh , with attractive o options . # UI: you can stay below twelve fifty . # PM: I think it's difficult as well , # ME: Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control . # PM: Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers . # UI: Scroll-wheel's one . # PM: Because then we save ten buttons . # PM: Then we have five and one . # PM: If we have this one and we've got the advanced W , we're getting close . # ID: We're getting closer . # ME: But how does scroll-wheel work here ? # PM: Then you will Or maybe you can scroll . # PM: If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display . # PM: Until you've got the right number , then you push it . # ME: That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also . Integrated scroll-wheel push-button . # PM: It's gotta scroll and push . # PM: but then you can push some other button as well . # ID: You could just not scroll for a half a second . # PM: That's right . So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second , then it g turns to that channel . # ID: So you won't need a button . # ME: I think that would be like the end of our usability . # PM: But it would definitely crop cost , a lot . # PM: And we need the battery . # PM: And the regular chip is not possible ? # PM: It has to be advanced ? # ID: If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you need an advanced chip , yes . # PM: It has to be advanced . Okay . # PM: And we can save a Euro by a flat design . # PM: That's an option we can Then we're almost there . # ID: if you v could just leave out one more button . # UI: or we have to skip the subtitle button . # PM: but I think that's That is a big advantage , if we're # UI: it's a big advantage . # PM: Can we use can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ? # PM: If you push it three times ? # ME: think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight , and teletext disappears . # ME: But the subtitles stay there . # UI: But if you push the teletext button twice # ID: What if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? Eight hundred eighty eight . # ME: I think that's the case on most # UI: It's One m one b , a few buttons . # PM: that's not really that # ME: that could be just like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click . # ME: But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people , who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is . # ME: Holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero . # ME: With only five buttons on it . And a scroll-wheel . # PM: I think if you make a good advertisement on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel . # PM: If you just make it real simple . # PM: Because it saves it saves a lot of money . # PM: And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen , which can provide extra information . How to use the scroll wheel . How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles . # PM: And it's good for the innovative design as well . If you would erase these . # PM: And we put Looks a bit odd maybe . # ME: That's a pretty big scroll wheel . # PM: That is Something like that . # PM: Then , . We've got the scroll-wheel . # PM: One , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one . # PM: And these are two buttons then . # ID: We could make two buttons out of that . # ID: And just If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel . # ID: So that would save two buttons . If you do the same for the channel . # PM: That's really a good idea , I think . # PM: And it will make the use of the scroll wheel more obvious indeed . # ID: More obvious . # PM: So we make one for the volume , one for the channel . Plus scroll . # PM: So we've got one , two , three . # PM: we can leave the teletext in if we want . # PM: That's m that's better . # ME: So this is five buttons . # ID: If we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat case . # ID: And make it smaller overall . # ID: So if you put the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button # PM: and then you can # ID: you get a much smaller remote . # PM: So we can decrease this one to four buttons . # ME: Right now we have five . # UI: But , you can make a f quite a big remote control for just the same price as a small one . # PM: That's no problem . # UI: Just you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . # PM: It's it's more the moulds in which they are being made , I think . # PM: Single curved is really easy to just fill in . # PM: And cases come right out of the machine . # PM: And single curved you have to have a different machine , than a flat one . # PM: I think this is a really easy one . , what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? # PM: Freek , what do you think ? # ME: I still think we should go for the single curve design . # ME: But then again , all these changes are not really okay with me . # ID: Richard's argument was very good . # ME: But since we just have to . # PM: We have to cut costs . # ME: I'd rather just go to the board and get us to spend eighteen dollars a remote . # PM: Ask for more money . # PM: I am agreeing with the usability . # ME: Or do some market research and see what the options are . # PM: But th I think we can then keep the single curved one . Just to express our L_C_D_ screen a bit more . # PM: So people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . # PM: It will be necessary to have good help function , as well . # PM: this is scroll . # PM: I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . Before we went on to the to the whole design . # ME: Yes . Definitely . # PM: But I'm glad we could make a bit . # PM: It's pretty different , if you saw the last one than this one . # ME: It's pretty different . # ME: But this is not really like for the group we were making our remote . # ME: This will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell . # ME: 'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff . # ME: This is not familiar for them . # ME: So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them . # PM: I think the most # UI: But they know the scroll-buttons from old radios . # UI: they cal also buttons like that for changing channels . # PM: We can stick it out , a bit . Like a old buttons . # PM: Maybe that's recognisable for them as well . # PM: That's a good one . # PM: I'm afraid we have to move on . # PM: And it's b less frightening , I think . # PM: If they see this design they think oh , there are only five buttons , and But we will see . # ME: Might might be confusing too . # PM: That's definitely right . # ME: They'd be like , what ? Only five buttons ? # UI: But very special , # PM: I would buy it . # ME: But you're not sixty . # PM: I would buy it if I was six . # PM: No I don't know . # PM: What it costs under twelve and a half Euros ? # PM: But we can go on with the project evaluation . # PM: I can sit down I think . # PM: We still have fifteen minutes left , so we're nice on schedule . # PM: , the project process . # ME: I like set up all these criteria . And evaluation of the thingy . # PM: Evaluation criteria . That's right . # PM: That was the point I forgot . # PM: I should There we are . Evaluation criteria . # PM: We've got five minutes I think for those criteria . # ME: Five more minutes ? # PM: No we've got fifteen minutes yes . What ? # ME: I did some literature study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier . # ME: Translated it into criteria , which would be these . # ME: , is the remote fancy ? The shape , look and feel . # ME: Innovative ? What new functions are there ? # ME: , learnability is a very important factor here . # ME: , is it functional ? # ME: Are there not too many functions among the functions ? # ME: And are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? # ME: The target group . Is the remote really for the group we're making it for ? # ME: And recognability . If our company is If it is easily recognisable that our company made it ? # ME: So we're supposed to evaluate it right now . # ME: I have to say this was a little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting were not here . # PM: that's because my pen failed to upload his data . # ME: Interesting . # PM: but it's giving errors by downloading the software . # ME: Is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ? # PM: I think it's fancy . # ME: We all go for six ? # ME: , is the design innovative ? # ME: I think so , with our L_C_D_ screen , docking station , scroll-buttons . # PM: Subtitles , buttons . # PM: So we've got twenty cents for our docking station , # ME: Should be do-able . # ME: Is the design easy to use ? # UI: Mm . Not really . # PM: That's a bit dodgy . # ME: Would be for us . # UI: For old people I # PM: I would say four . Four or five between . Between four or five . # ID: Four or five . Yes . # ME: I'd go for four , too . # PM: Is it functional ? # ME: Is the design functional ? # ME: , do we have all functions that we want to include ? # ME: Do we have too many functions ? # ME: I don't think so . # ME: It's pretty slim . # PM: Think it's seven . # ME: and do we take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? Like it getting lost and R_S_I_ influences ? # ID: Mm , we haven't thought of that one . # PM: I had them worked out . # PM: Mm . They are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost . # ME: Are the production costs within the preset limits ? # ME: Does the design fit the group of focus ? # ID: I think that's a three . # PM: I think with our new radio button , I think it's I think it's better . # ME: I think it doesn't . # UI: We have to test it # ID: I still I think it's too m too fancy . Too too flashy . # ME: I think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control . # PM: I would give it a four . # ME: I think I'd go for two . # UI: I go for three . # PM: Then we have to do the three . # ME: Is the company recognisable ? # ME: we have the logo there . # PM: And they wanna put fashion in their products . in the slogan of the company . # PM: And we have the removable front cases . # PM: So , I think it's very recognisable . # ME: So that will be this . # ME: I was also supposed to calculate the score , but thought we would have another private thingy after this . # PM: We've got a calculate it . # ID: Twendag sieven an twendag . # ME: Is this after this , are we done ? Or # PM: We've gonna We're going to evaluate it . # ME: We're gonna go to our other room again . # ME: These are seven factors times seven is forty something . Two ? # ME: , minus one . Minus three , minus four . Minus four . # ME: So that would be minus eight . # ME: Forty one out of forty nine . # PM: That's Around eighty percent . # ME: Guess I'll just type that in on the bottom here . # PM: That's eighty four percent . # PM: I think that's a pretty nice score . # ME: that will be the evaluation . # PM: that brings us to the project evaluation . # PM: Project process . # PM: Did we move through the right phases , you think ? Along the process ? # ME: Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier . In the design phase . # PM: So lack of information about prices . # PM: Satisfaction . # PM: Was there room for creativity ? # ME: Not too much . No . # PM: It's because of the finance sheet . # ID: , there w there was enough room , but the finance # ME: And I would've liked to go for the younger users also . # ME: And just to be able to access internet and get something of your own . # PM: Restrictions . Internet access . # PM: Was it clear what everybody had to do according to their roles and functions ? # PM: Teamwork ? Did it work out ? Working together ? Also , you two of you with the last phase ? # ID: The tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step and it's very easy . # PM: Were the means sufficient for the tasks we had to do ? # PM: Or were they too much ? # ID: the smart-board , the d drawing is just a pain in the ass , but The digital the digital pen is very nice . # PM: If it wants to download its data . # PM: Failed download . Smart-board was irritating . # PM: So you rather wanted to have a flip-over ? Or something else ? # ID: A flip-over or a more precise digit # UI: A flipper's easier , # PM: Faster as well , I think . # UI: But if you want to share of when you make a picture like this on the presentation , it's easier to share it with other people . # UI: you can sh save it and put it on the internet , or uh in shared f folder or sh shared directory . # ME: I tried to open the file on my laptop , # ID: No . Didn't work . # ME: but not possible . # PM: you need a smart board application I think . # PM: But I think you can # UI: T can you export it like a . # PM: Should be possible . you can export it as image . # ME: Should've done that then . # PM: the sharing of the information was okay ? # PM: , pen is here on the table . # PM: It's possible . # UI: It's possible . # PM: Have we found new ideas for having this kind of meetings ? # UI: maybe when we n just give the numbers of o one of out of s sev it's easier to do the th things that are like that on a computer . , so just l like at u university # PM: everybody puts his own score . # PM: And then it mediates the score , and you can get one That's better . # PM: So that's How do we call ? Evaluation criteria . # PM: Okay . Mm , any more ideas ? # PM: Or questions about the project ? Or about the product ? # PM: Because I think then that we get to our last sheet . # PM: Are the costs within the budget ? # ID: Considering we are not going to make a docking station . # PM: Docking station . # PM: That's a good point . # PM: But maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ? # PM: and I think you can compensate that as well . # PM: So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem , because it's very cheap to make as well . # PM: Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ? # PM: Or what was it ? # PM: Fifteen fifteen million . # PM: I think we will . If we gonna export this product . # PM: It's innovative . # PM: Especially in America . People are pretty decadent . Sometimes . # ME: still I think if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people . # PM: You can do more . # ME: So maybe we should just re-focus . # PM: Just put it on the market for everybody . # PM: You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers . # ME: Or specifically for younger people . # PM: That's one thing you can change it with . # PM: So you can also try to reach the younger people by putting fancy covers on the market . Just as a test . See how it works . # PM: That's I think a good advantage . # ME: I think then it would be way more popular with younger people than it is , than would be with older people . Even if it were their covers . # PM: , then I think we can have our little celebration , right now . # PM: I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire . I think . # UI: Where's the champagne ? # PM: I didn't get a message from the from ending of the # PM: I think I have one now . # PM: Five more minutes ? # PM: Oh that's nice . # PM: Then we still have some questions . # PM: If somebody has some questions they can ask them now . # PM: Or we can put these in the project folder as well . # PM: Maybe that's Export as picture , I think . # PM: This is another network , I guess . # PM: Does somebody see the project folder ? # PM: My Documents . # UI: maybe they will save it . # PM: I'll just put it in My Documents # ME: , it probably will . # PM: I think I'm going to make our final presentation now . # ME: you're supposed to make a final # PM: And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation . Summary of the project . # ME: Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ? # UI: maybe we have to fill another questionnaire . # PM: Questionnaire . # PM: I think you all get a questionnaire in your room . # PM: And then I'll meet you in I think about ten minutes , or something . # PM: Hopefully my pen will download its software . Oh . Or data . # ME: That'd be nice .
# PM: Good morning . # UI: Good morning . # ME: Good morning . # PM: before I start with the with the meeting I have a few things to tell you about the setting we're in , because we're being watched by Big Brother . # ME: By Big Brother ? # PM: These are cameras , so are these . # PM: This thing that looks like a pie , are actually all microphones . # PM: you must be careful with all this . # PM: And as I can see you have placed your laptops exactly on the place where it must be . # PM: And that has to do with the camera settings , so we don't have our laptops in front of the cameras . # PM: So they can see our faces . # PM: Welcome at the kick-off meeting . # PM: My name is Danny Wolfs . # PM: this is the agenda for today . # PM: first a little opening . # PM: I will introduce myself , and I think it's very good to introduce yourself . # PM: then a little bit of acquaintance , acquaintance to ourselves . # PM: So we get to know each other . # PM: that will be done with a tool training from the he these two smart boards . # PM: Then the project plan . # PM: What we're going to do , and how we're going to do it . # PM: and discussion about that and a little closing at the end . # PM: my name is Danny Wolfs . # PM: I'm the Project Manager . # PM: What's your name ? # UI: I'm Juergen Toffs . # UI: I'm the User Interface Designer . # PM: User interface , okay . # ID: I'm the Industrial Designer . # PM: Industrial , yes . # ME: my function is the Marketing Expert . # PM: First a little about the project aim . # PM: the aim is to make a new remote control . # PM: maybe you have read the website . # PM: It's a very , very ambitious company . # PM: They they wanna do something else . # PM: there must be a new remote control . # PM: first of all it must be original , and trendy . # PM: That's two things really close to each other . # PM: But at the same time user-friendly . # PM: And they have that's very important for them . # PM: there are three stages . # PM: There is a functional design . # PM: what are we going to do ? # PM: What are we going to uh make f kind of functions in the remote ? # PM: And why are we going to do it ? # PM: Then the conceptual design . # PM: How are going to do it ? # PM: And that's really global . # PM: because at the detailed design , how , part two , we go to dig in really about how the te the technical of If it's possible technical-wise . # PM: each stage is broken up in two stages , individual work and a meeting . # PM: So it's very straightforward . # PM: the tool training . # PM: We have two smart boards . # PM: This one is for the presentations , the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you had . # PM: and this is only for drawing . # PM: we must let it stand on this programme . # PM: This is called a smart board # ME: Speaks for itself . # PM: it speaks for itself . # PM: and as you may have heard , the documents in the shared folder can be showed on this screen . Not in y the My Documents . # PM: So if you wanna show something , put it in the shared folder . # PM: This is very straightforward , with the save , the print , the undo , the blank , the select , the pen . # PM: I don't gonna explain it all , because I think you know how it works . # PM: we must not forget everything we draw on here , all must be saved . # PM: We we may not delete anything . # PM: So if you have drawn something , save it . # PM: Never delete it . # PM: That's a very important thing . # PM: little kinda exercise to know each other . # PM: At the white board on the left . Every every one of us must draw our favourite animal , and tell us why we had chosen that animal . # PM: important is that we use different colours , and different pen widths . Widths . Widths . # ME: I have a question . # ME: this exercise , did the company board tell you to do it , or did you just make it up yourself ? # PM: It's it's I must do it . # ME: It's part of the introduction , # PM: 'Cause we really don't know each other , and it's kinda new . # PM: So getting used to each other , we can have a little fun then , before we dig in really to the hard stuff . # PM: That kind of thing . # PM: Would you start with drawing your favourite animal ? # ME: I don't know really how it works . # ME: But maybe you can show us first ? # PM: Drawing goes with this thing . # PM: Do not touch your hand on this little thingy here . # PM: That's important . # PM: So hold it like this . # ME: You g you get electrocuted or # PM: You must p push a little Good . # PM: Because And wait a few seconds . # PM: It's not fully real-time , so watch it . # PM: I'm gonna paint in the red . # PM: That's the background colour . # PM: One minute please . # PM: , that's the one . Well , five . # PM: My favourite animal huh ? # ME: It's like Pictionary ? # PM: you can guess what it is . # ME: The the one who says it first gets a raise . # PM: May paint next . # PM: No , it's not an orc . # PM: You don't see it at the ears ? # ME: I have it at home . # PM: You have an orc at home ? # UI: Very artistic . # ME: What's it called ? # PM: 'Cause we have a cat at home and he's called Simba . # PM: 'Cause he looks like the lion from The Lion King . # ME: Miniature size ? # PM: So we found it kinda cool to name it after a lion . # PM: He's happy with us , he's smiling . # UI: He does have body Huh . # PM: only the face . # PM: Because we have we have twen twenty five minutes . # ME: We have to speed up . # ME: Remember you use different colours , and different pen widths . # PM: who wants to go next ? # PM: choose a colour , choose a pen width and draw # UI: You don't have to change the colour and the pen width during the drawing . # ME: You have to save it . # UI: You have to draw push hard on the pen # ME: Mm Not really . # PM: Kind of firm touch . # ME: Which one is it ? # ME: 'Kay , that's fine . # ID: By the way , why was your cat red ? # PM: Because my cat is red at home . # PM: And I have red hair , so must be red . # UI: It's a very bloody cat . # ME: It's not an apple . # ME: Something like this . # UI: it is a turtle . # PM: It is a turtle . # PM: Why a turtle ? Why ? Tim ? # ME: 'Cause I liked Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles . # PM: You watched it a lot ? # PM: You watched it a lot ? # UI: It's inside its shell . You'll be finished sooner . # PM: It's a scared turtle . # ME: It's coming up . # PM: Okay , Tim . Thank you . # ME: Something like this . Okay , you know Very artistic . # PM: Jurgen , you want to go next ? # UI: How did it work ? # PM: And then you have the current colour , # UI: Performance ? # PM: you can change . # PM: So no red or green . # PM: And line width . # PM: Tim had Tim , what kinda line width did you have ? # ME: the big lines were like nine . # UI: I just thought I'd pick the easiest one . # PM: You have a dog at home ? # UI: we had a dog , a few years ago . # UI: And and it , when it died we didn't get a new one or something . # ME: It's pretty good # PM: You have an artistic inner middle . # UI: a Graphical User Designer , so # ME: Think you picked the wrong function . Wrong job . # UI: No . Can work together . colour . # PM: So I think you can see it's real really a easy programme to use . Not difficult at all . # ME: That's enough , thanks . # PM: Janus ? The last one ? # PM: After a cat , a turtle and a dog . # PM: I think he's gonna draw an elephant . # ID: I figure I should do something like that , but I'm gonna do something much more difficult . # UI: he is the artistic design . # ME: I'm gonna design a remote control animal . # UI: Remote control animal . # UI: with the interface , it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there . # ME: That that might be easier . # ME: But at the other hand , a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand , I think it's easier to draw . # PM: Better to draw with a with # ME: With a pen than with a mouse . # UI: Than on the , with I m I mean like on here , drawing . And then displaying on screen , but # ME: W with this paper it's too mu too expensive . # PM: But what is he ? # UI: Too expensive , . # PM: Is it a rabbit ? # PM: Do you have a rabbit at home ? # ME: It's a rabbit with broken legs ? # UI: A green rabbit . # PM: Is it a white rabbit f It's the white rabbit from The Matrix . # UI: There , the g white green rabbit . # UI: He's a little bit stoned there . # ID: I figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit . # PM: Finishing touch and then we're going further . # ME: Project Manager ? # ID: Where does the pen go ? # ME: Have you been counting the time ? # ME: Let's go on then . # PM: I think the dog is the most artistic . # ID: I figured the rabbit was actually the most impressive . # PM: Don't choose for youself . # PM: That's selfish . # PM: now we're gonna dig into the to the serious stuff . # ME: It's pretty abstract . # PM: the selling price for the remote will be twenty five Euro , and the production cost may not be more than twenty and a half Euro . # PM: from my point of view , I don't think it's gonna be very high tech , high definition , ultra modern kinda remote , for twelve fift twelve and a half Euro . # PM: the profit we must make with the new remote is fifty million Euro . # PM: So that's a lot . # PM: We have to sell a lot of # UI: how much is it ? # ME: Like how much ? # UI: Hundred million remotes or something ? # PM: I think w when the selling price is twenty five , uh you got two million , two million remotes . # ID: Twenty million . # ID: Two million , oh , two million . # PM: But our marketing range is , market range is international . # PM: So we have virtually the whole world we can sell we can sell our r remotes to . # PM: At least that countries which have a television . # PM: now it's time for us to going to discuss a little things . # PM: You can think about experience with a remote control yourself , at home . # PM: What you think might be a useful new feature . # PM: What what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others . # PM: let's discuss a little . # PM: I'm gonna join you at the table . # PM: what what's the most important thing at a remote control ? # UI: I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . # UI: And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible . # PM: So not a not a remote control who uh which can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio and Or just only # ME: but I have some points . # ME: Can I show them on the on the big screen ? Maybe ? # PM: If you have them on I can # PM: in case you want it This is a dead kind of fly . Between the , the # PM: , be The screens . # UI: Is it possible to open pen drawings in this on this screen ? # PM: All the drawings go there , at the left # UI: but which The ones we made on the # PM: Oh , that pen drawings . # PM: I think when it is in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documents folder , you can show it there . # UI: Oh , only in Word , # ME: I have some points from marketing point of view . # ME: just the standard thing li things like intuitive , small , fairly cheap . # ME: it's pretty cheap , twenty five Euros . # ME: brand independent . I think , it doesn't have to matter which brand your T_V_ or other thing is . # PM: Five minutes . # ME: Five minutes ? # ME: I'll wrap it up quickly . # ME: I personally think it has to be multi-purpose . # ME: most of the remote c remote controls are just for one purpose . # ME: And by making it multi-purpose , it has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from current products . # ME: maybe some other technology than infrared . # ME: I rather find it very annoying , like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it . # ME: think about sending it over radio waves or bluetooth . # ME: That might be a little bit expensive . # ME: And something like an L_C_D_ screen . # UI: For what purpose ? # ME: like I said here Maybe it's easy . # ME: It's nice as an added feature , that , when you're on a certain channel , you can see on the L_C_D_ screen what programmes are coming up or # PM: So it be a multi-purpose very technically high # ME: From my point of view , . # PM: it must be really innovative , technical-wise ? # ME: it has to be our company is very good in making new innovative things . # PM: I agree with you . # PM: So we must focus on things who are really add something to # ME: To the current market . # ME: you got some cheap remote controls there . # ME: They just you got a dozen of 'em . # ME: But when you enter a new market with a remote control and wanna gain market share you have to do something special , I think . # PM: But we have to keep an eye that it's at the beginning of such a project , it's very cool to talk about , well , this would be cool , that would be cool . # PM: but we must not lose sight of the user uh friendly # UI: And and the price . # ME: But it's But but this is just from marketing aspect . # ME: I don't know anything about user interface or design . # PM: And that's because we have him . # PM: next meeting will start in thirty minutes . # PM: you will have individual actions where I presume will be some feedback , via the m the mail . # PM: the Industrial Designer has to look at the working design . # PM: the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions . # PM: that's the thing we discussed . # UI: one thing , we must first agree on what we're going to m going to make . # UI: Are we going to use it for multiple systems ? # UI: We should have some agreement on that before we # ME: I don't think we have to be , we have to agree on that . # ID: I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually . # ME: I think th that's a pha That's a phase further . # ME: Ju just make some mock-ups , some general ideas . # ME: And and then we can plan We can plan further , I think . # PM: But maybe , because you are working on the user requirements , you are working on the technical functions , we must have a little or kinda uh How do you call it ? # UI: Consensus on the , what we're gonna do . # PM: a little plan on what we're going to do . # PM: So you don't uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the technical functions at all . # PM: Some basic things we co we want to going to do . # PM: I think that's well . # PM: Will come in handy . # ME: You're the Project Manager . # UI: if the technical functions have to be designed , I I've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be . # UI: Or do we use it a text screen ? # UI: Or will it be with bluetooth or # PM: th that's really a step further . # PM: But if you say is it uh one way or multi-purpose , that's a # ME: tha that's a same step further . # ID: , actually it is . # ID: Then looking at individual components , so that's actually a f step further . # ME: we all have a list of things that has to b that have to be in it , or how it has to be like . # ME: And then in the next meeting we decide # ID: we can take it from there . # ME: w what it's gonna be . # ID: , I agree , we can take it from there . # ME: And then you s then you can delete # ME: the o the obsolete details . # PM: each individually i individually must think on what's at his point of view is the most important . # PM: And then we're going to fit all the pieces together the next meeting . # PM: I must finish off now , so it's over . # PM: You will receive specific instructions by your personal coach . # PM: And I see you in thirty minutes .
# ID: I see my bunny is still standing . # ID: No one drawing it . # PM: It's too beautiful . # ID: I figured that much . # PM: A minute please , my laptop is there it is , thank you . # PM: welcome back . At the functional design meeting the plan is that each one of you , so not me but only you will present the things you worked on the last half hour . # PM: I will take minutes and will put the minutes that I have at the end of the session in the shared folder . # PM: Also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , so you can read that now or afterwards . # PM: I had an email from the from the management board , I don't know if you a al also received it , but there were four points which I think are very important . # PM: First one is they think that teletext becomes outdated and internet will be the main focus . # PM: second one is also important , because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session . # PM: the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , so it not gonna it's not gonna be a multi-purpose remote control , so that's one thing to keep in mind . # PM: second , and I think that's important for the Marketing Expert , the current customers are in the age group of forty years and older , but with this new remote they will would like to reach a group younger than forty . # PM: I think to keep in mind , but not really for now is that they want the slogan and the and the logo to be recognised more in the remote . # PM: we have forty minutes , so I think not more than ten minutes uh per presentation each , and please use all the facilities so that you have either SMARTboards , the Word files , what you whatever you want . # PM: Tim , can you start ? # ME: I have some new findings on Marketing Expert level , which I will show you . # ME: The method I used was giving orders to our usability lab to do a questionnaire . # ME: one hundred respondents were involved and my marketing department generated a report with a lot of results . # ME: , these were a couple of findings , first page of three . # ME: , we have three audiences of two audiences , I'm sorry . # ME: the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five age . # ME: the second one is from sixty four forty six to sixty five . # ME: , as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent sixty five . # ME: second audience is thirty five percent . # ME: Mm and some interests from the from the age groups , it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy new technology stuff , like an L_C_D_ screen on the remote control , speech recognition . # ME: I don't think that's really appropriate . # ME: , and when you see the audience , the age is going up , they don't really want it anymore , at least the new technologies . # ME: Second findings out of the questionnaire are the opinion the opinions of the audience about current remote controls . # ME: First point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . # ME: So that's maybe something for the User Interface Designer . # ME: third findings . # ME: According to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , following buttons are most important . # ME: , I will tell something about the way this test was , done . # ME: , persons were asked what the buttons were they use most , how much an hour , and in the second table the importance of those buttons . # ME: , when you multiply them , you get the these three points . # ME: Switching channels , that's pretty normal , that's what you do with a remote control . # ME: the second , teletext , and the third , volume controls . # ME: , I think it's good that we know what the user want wants , at least the these three points have to be very clear . # PM: But it's strange that the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be outdated by the internet . # PM: So that that's strange . # ME: but at the moment teletext is , th the best thing you can get on T_V_ , like getting information . # ME: when you ask people , what do they use , they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control . # ME: That's ridiculous . # ME: That's a ne i it It's a new technology , but it's not incorporated right now . # ME: my personal preferences . , I think we should aim at the audience from sixteen to forty five . # ME: Mm , first of all it's the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent . # ME: second , I think you will get the most revenue from i from it . # ME: people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of T_V_ , more than people who are el elder . # ME: second point , we have to impro improve the most used functions , as I said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls . # ME: Third point that came out of the of the questionnaire , people used to get lost off the remote controller , so maybe it's an idea for us to design ex kind of placeholder on side of the , of the T_V_ # PM: that's a cool idea . # ME: where you can put the remote control in . # ME: , that's about it , I think . # ID: When you mentioned improving functions , what do you mean by that what are you think about ? # ME: not the r not the functions , # ID: , the funtionability . # ME: but it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used on a remote control . # ME: So you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds of buttons , but if you don't use them , it's # ID: so focusing more on the used buttons . # ME: they have to be on it j just to t to get it done if necessary , but the most used buttons have to be bigger or # ID: Could you use perhaps one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example . # ME: Just for the minor functions perhaps . # ID: , ma perhaps , just an idea . # ME: Just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn . # PM: Thank you , Tim . # PM: Janus , can you # ID: yeah , I'll go , sure . # ID: I'll be explaining a bit about working design about the project . # ID: what I did was I dissected uh current remote controls and I viewed how they w looked , how they worked , what kind of components are involved , and how they are connected together . # ID: And after that I put up a scheme about how these things are organised and I'll show it to you in a in a few seconds . # ID: And I'll explain a bit about how it works and how we could build one and why I think several possibilities that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off . # ID: right . well what I did was I checked remote controls and the remote controls of today are all infrared , not like all probably know . # ID: And the thing about that is the remote controls have to act as a T_V_ or a stereo or something , and those have a transmitter that's also focused on infrared , so if we want to build mm a remote control with Bluetooth for instance then the T_V_ should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate , so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus that's that wouldn't mean a cheap remote control for us . # ID: So that's probably why most controls are still infrared . # ID: Furthermore they all have a very simple structure , so that would probably mean lower costs that could mean for us a good thing 'cause well we should be able to build a relatively cheap a cheap remote . # ID: as I mentioned ready , we have some Bluetooth it may be possible , but I figured it wouldn't be possible in within our budget , but that's not for me to decide , but that's maybe something for marketing to look into . # ID: because well my personal opinion is not to do Bluetooth or radio waves , although # ME: What do you think about incorporating Bluetooth or a radio receiver in the place-holder next to the T_V_ , connected to the T_V_ ? # ID: actually I have t # ME: So it's in the wrong product . # ID: I actually I figured that would be that would be rather nice , but then you'd still have the infrared function . # ID: So in theory you'd actually just move the problem , but what I did think about was when you mentioned about the cup-holder , is why not introduce a speech function like where is the remote . # ID: If somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes beep or something , I dunno , maybe something to look into , I dunno what the cost that something like that would be . # ID: But it may be may be something to explore . # ID: I'll just explain a bit of the components . # ID: first you have the energy source . # ID: The energy source would be a battery , simple battery that you can find anywhere . # ID: I figured that would be best , 'cause when the battery stops functioning we could just use you could just go out and buy a new one . # ID: So we didn't and we don't have to do all to be too complicated about that . # ID: the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but the infrared button works only via the chip and the subcomponent to the switch there is a switch between these . # ID: When the switch is pressed in a w on this case it switches a button , when a button is prush pushed in , a electric current goes through here , and in immediately , a l a bulb lights up displaying to the user that something has happened . # ID: That's that's so the h user won't be thinking , well did the button be pressed , w what happened . # ID: Or I press button but nothing's happening on the T_V_ , so is something wrong or something . # ID: So that's just to explain the of to make it clearer to the user . # ID: the signal goes via chip that's translated into electric sig electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb where it will be uh received on the receiving end . # ID: And those interpreted by the device , well in this case the television . # ID: my personal preferences here , we have to keep it simple . Not too many gadgets and functions , just like you said the most users n you have a lot of buttons and you u use you don't use them , so why should we invent w spend more time on those . # ID: I think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and no receiving . # ID: no input from the television . # ID: I think we shouldn't be spending time on teletext and st things like that , because when you want teletext on infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too , in order to receive the signals from what's on T_V_ and such . # ID: I figure that would be spending too much money and time # ME: maybe another problem , I think current T_V_s can even send infrared . # ID: but what should we s I f I agree with you , but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the remote control ? # ID: 'Cause that would be I mean extra components , extra designs , larger g remote control . # ID: These all stuff that we have to take in account . # ID: So I my personal opinion is no receiver at all . # ID: we should look into the design and the functionability . # ID: Like I said , use one button for instance for m multiple functions , or well just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something , the usual stuff . # ID: And don't overbuild , we shouldn't make a big remote control for simple functions , but we should stick to the basics . # ID: So that was my personal opinion . # ID: And that was my presentation # PM: thank you Janus . # UI: I can go ahead . # PM: The last presentation . # PM: You have plenty of time , # UI: Last presentation . Okay . # PM: Tim and Janus don't talk to ten minutes , take your time . # PM: If you take your time too long I will eventually warn you . # UI: I'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and usability functions . # UI: what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one , so if you going to design a remote that looks good , that shouldn't weigh over the if it's possible to make , of course , but also the user friendliness , so tha that's some of the main points . # UI: And another one is the use of many functions will make it more difficult , so use as little functions as possible or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote . # UI: If you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons t to be shown at the same time , 'cause when you visit an internet site you don't want fifty links to see , but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy structure . # UI: And well one of the ideas was maybe use touch screen , but s I don't know in how far that is possible , since we are sticking to infrared and the remote cannot receive anything , but we might consider that . # UI: of course I hope this is all clear to you . # UI: you can use remote like this with all the functions , many functions , but Well , your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this . # UI: You have to be very careful what you push , and if you're looking for teletext you'll be searching for half an hour where is it ? Where the hell he here I guess and , when you have to use something else . # UI: So just keep it simple , make clear buttons , easy to use . # UI: For example if you want to use a play and back and stop , that's very important . # UI: this was because of our last discussion , if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines , but it's no longer applying . # UI: I prefer to use it only for T_V_ not to give too many options and if possible , the buttons should give a dr direct action , not first select # PM: you just said you wanted to combine more functions in one , you want to keep it simple , # UI: and so that's where the difficulties lie . # PM: but I think that if you want to do that , then you can't escape the fact that there will be buttons which give s more options than one . # UI: so that's the thing you have to weigh against each other . # UI: Do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or multi-purpose as we thought , or do we want to use many buttons . # UI: weighing those factors . # ME: it's maybe an option if you use an L_C_D_ or a touch screen , that in the middle are the main keys , like displayed on the # ME: Something like that . # ME: just in the middle the general functions , like play , channel switching , and then at the top or at the bottom , some menus like settings or that you can drop down . # UI: but when all the questions I had Do we want to use a menu display on the T_V_ ? # UI: Or does have to f everything be in remotes ? # UI: 'Cause if you use a memory display on the T_V_ , you can simply push a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay . # UI: that's my recommendation , if you use many options in one buttle button , display the menu on the T_V_ and don't use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , is too complicated for most users . # ME: I think so too , and that's partly because a lot of T_V_s have different menus , and when you have a particular menu at your device , it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on T_V_ . # UI: , that will be a problem . # ID: you d you have to keep in mind that several T_V_s don't even have a menu structure , or they have a very simple menu structure , you have to keep in mind that not all d not our remote won't be able to work on all televisions . # ID: And that would be a considerable problem . # UI: if we have to stick with current technologies and well , the restrictions of what's is on the market today , you should keep it s at this . # UI: Use big clear buttons . Not too many . # UI: So maybe we'll loose a few option options , but I think i this is more important . # UI: especially the important buttons , if you want to switch channel , change your volume , use teletext , it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind a little thing or a touch screen . # ID: Not embed but then with something like a touch screen could make more menu up pop up or something . # UI: if you want to uh s put on stand-by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do . # UI: Not first change menu options or switch something . # UI: as you already told , give some feedback . # UI: If the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low . # UI: And , well , my conclusion is less is more , keep it simple . # UI: maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to keep it accessible because you all know , if there are a lot of function on the television , some you you'll never know and never use , and therefore it's important if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions that are not so important well you we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the for the most important functions . # ME: I think the idea about touch screen is very good . # ME: , because recently I saw news item on T_V_ about new telephones for elder people . # ME: , they have like a touch screen with really big pictures on it like uh call hang-up , and that's a big ad advantage I think , because one the one hand you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by scaling up the pictures or something . # ME: very visual intended . # ME: What was I to say more ? # UI: Maybe that's an option . # UI: keep the primary buttons visible . # UI: make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues well , put a logo on it and maybe use it in some aesthetic form . # UI: But th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear and maybe use a touch screen , or if that's will become too difficult just like televi some o older telephones use a l maybe it's possible to flip them open and just expand the number of options that are normally visible . # ME: but if you pick the idea , the left idea then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen ? # ID: The extra functions . # UI: The extra functions , you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one , # ME: but l like menu functions or # UI: and then all the options will become available and you just c s t scroll through them . # ID: Wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen , one small touch screen applet # ID: and I'll just make let's say fifteen buttons on it , and we have three of those , actually just menus with sub-menus , with or sub-items , sub-functions . # UI: then I'd like to make a proposal . # UI: If you make one big touch screen , use the same concept as here , keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest . # ID: like the iPod idea that we just saw . # ID: You just have a f a few selected buttons and a few menus , and with this idea you could actually make several you can also improve later on . # ID: I think that will be great . # PM: So you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen . # ID: , I wou I would actually go for the # UI: Okay , I agree , but I think it's very important that they always make the same buttons accessible , so use just for special options a part of the touch screen . # UI: And so an elder designer picks up th the of an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions , you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the T_V_ or to switch the channel without well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions . # ME: I had another idea about maybe parental control . , like building in some kind of PIN code which allows parents to switch to all channels , but children if children don't know the PIN code , they can't switch to violent channels or # UI: Is that possible to use or no ? # ID: That is possible , that actually depends on the television , # ME: Th there's just # ID: but I think I figure that would be # UI: does it have to depend on the television ? # ME: Ju just a simple log-in , something like that . # ID: y you s you see the fi thing is when you buy a remote , you set the channels , the channels are different on each te television , they aren't set in a preset order , if you lock on a remote , let's say channel fifteen , well channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television , so that would be that would be actually the main concern . # UI: I think that he means that maybe by some option make sure that remote control and the T_V_ match , and then after that you can use some s insert some passwords as being apparent that the children cannot use this change the settings of the T_V_ , like colour and then volume # ME: th that kind of stuff , but maybe if you log in first as a parent , you address the channels and like oh , that's channel fifteen , vi violent channel , # UI: Oh , something like that . # ME: m my ki my kids I don't want my kids to watch that , then you set the priority to only parents , # UI: b but make it a separate option in the menu , # UI: so that it's dif dis displayed from displayed here , # ME: but , that's just # ME: that's an a an added feature . # PM: But let's not go too wide about the those things , that's that why we're here . # ME: th those things are nice . # PM: It's it's a nice idea , but I think that's we wel later in the stage . # PM: I've one little question about a total touch screen # PM: , a partial , because I think elderly people may be not used to a touch screen , so they want the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , to be , kinda traditionals and the other functions , the more difficult functions to be maybe on the touch screen , but to keep this as normal as possible , to keep it accessible . # ME: but if you display it on L_C_D_ screen with r really big numbers # UI: you can de display it on the on the old style . # ME: that's just as e just as easy . # UI: You can display actual buttons on the touch screens . # PM: , that's true , that's true . # ID: I do agree , because well , it's just not the same when you touch a touch screen or when you touch a button , but well we have to look at what's our target audience . # ME: , it's different . # ID: W we are aiming for younger people # ID: and they chose # ME: age b below forty . # PM: , yeah , that's a good point . Yep . # ID: So that's probably a # ME: And th those young people , . Y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy stuff , # PM: They like the fancy stuff , . That's true . # ME: A touch screen , like Microsoft al already developed something like that for uh multi-media applications . # ME: I th I think we can do that too . # PM: Mm . Okay , as you can see the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are done . # PM: I've added the this four things from the management board just to keep in mind . # PM: each time I had a sort of summary on what you told and what you personal think . # PM: so that can be can be read out . # PM: a f a few things I noticed were Moment . # PM: th the main points in this uh in this meeting is I think how it's going to look we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to have more options and have them hidden or something , so they don't you don't have a big thing full of buttons the point that you wanna use one controller for uh hypothetically each television , so you must the functions , know , like the menus or the parental control must be all by the done by the remote control and not by the television . # PM: I think that's the point what we discussed . # ME: The menus are not identical for all th for all T_V_s , so you have to display it on one T_V_ . # UI: you can use when you how do you call it , s synchronized , the remote and the T_V_ , # ME: but that's not possible . # UI: then there's always , there are always possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume and well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote in its memory can see what kinda T_V_ it is , it's a Philips , this and this and that , and then give the options that are capable the capable from the t # PM: but you have uh an # ME: Add th that that's an opportunity . # PM: but you have an international market range , so you have I think a big range of # UI: there are universal d um remotes and they all have a functionality for all the T_V_s , so this wouldn't be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these . # PM: And it's not too complex to do it . # ID: they all have to be programmed to fit your T_V_ and that is bit of a tricky job . # ID: I actually use one of those They are they are kinda troublesome , but the thing is whe when you start building something like this you have to build a receiver into the t into the remotes , because in order for the remote to process something from the T_V_ , like to synchronise and you have to send and receive , and that's well # UI: you can just say the c # ME: He he me he means just one other thing . # PM: Just build it in . # ME: , with the current remote controls , the universal ones , you have to press , you have to press a code for T_V_ . # UI: In codes , y you get a b a book with codes . # UI: You look up , I have a Philips H_ fifty five and it says press code four five # UI: and you press code four five on the in the remote and it displays all your menu options . # ID: Oh , yeah , sure , that would be possible , . # ME: Now we just connect the T_V_ type to a set of options , in just in the memory , # UI: Memory in the in the remote . # ME: so that if you , like profile , so that if you touch in like one four one zero kind of T_V_ the memory pops up the options . # ID: , that would be possible . , sure . # ME: I th don't think that's that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables . # ID: No , that wouldn't be , a few variables . # UI: if you look at the manuals from universal remotes , there are maybe three four hundreds T_V_s at maximum . If you have all of them , all the old and new T_V_s summed up , I think it is possible . # ID: It is definitely po # ME: But , on the other hand on the other hand , if you have a remote and buy a new T_V_ that isn't incorporated in the remote # PM: We have five minutes to go . # UI: Well then you have to buy a new one , it's very good for marketing # UI: or an update , software update . # ME: A firmware upgrade or something , # UI: Firmware update , you say . # ID: , firmware upgrade . # ME: but from where ? # ID: That's maybe the cup holder . # ME: No m may no , maybe we can incorporate some kind of U_S_B_ or a firewire connection , so that you can connect it to the P_C_ and download the newest firmware from the internet . # ID: not everybody has a P_C_ at home . # ID: the most people have , but not everybody # UI: you can go back to the shop and they # ME: like a s kind of service centre . # ID: , maybe something like service cen # UI: and they can download it for you . # ID: Or you could well you could s actually look at the place-holder you talked about earlier , and you could probably make a connection to an telephone line or a internet connection . # UI: already digital information is sent t to the standards , T_V_ connections , you can see what's programme is on the new channels , so maybe j they we can send that information along with standard T_V_ # ID: then it's be back to the building a receiving well if it's actually worth it to build it in , # UI: Receiving . Oh . # ID: we could actually look at into it , but I dunno , it would be bringing more costs with it # ME: I think it's most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates at the service centre or at the shop . # UI: , s I think some I think it's good idea , . # ID: , that would be probably best , . # ID: Like when you when you buy a T_V_ you just ask well I'll # ME: It's it's not a lot of work , just one docking station where you put it in , press start , bling , updated . # ID: , that would be best , . # ME: You don't buy a T_V_ every week , new teev so . # UI: let's save this in the meanwhile # ID: No no . Exactly , so # UI: m for which one are we going ? # ID: my vote goes out to the right . # UI: Your vote and your # ME: And your vote ? # UI: I was doubting about which one to take , but you've convinced me that if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal remote all elderly people will know what to do . # ME: And also like a clapping li like device that pops open . # UI: Opens up is too difficult # ME: too difficult , maybe it's easier to break it . # UI: Break it , I don't get # PM: It's very sensitive . # ME: Like my telephone , it's sensitive too . # PM: Okay well it's almost at the end . # PM: So we have now a lunch break , finally , after the lunch break it's back to individual work , once again thirty minutes . # PM: I will put my minutes I have updated them so s they're updated in the shared folder too . # ME: Thirty minutes ? # PM: Thirty minutes , # PM: the specifi specific instructions for the next meeting you will all will receive at the email . # PM: I don't think I can say much about it , so uh wait for your email and hopefully you get it done in the in the thirty minutes , and I w will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes . # ME: One question , how late do we have to get back be back here ? # PM: thirty minutes . # UI: A quarter to one maybe ? # ME: Thirty minutes lunch break ? # PM: Thirty minutes lunch break , . # PM: Oh . Forty five ? # ME: I thought forty five . # PM: then would it be one o'clock . # PM: Or we ask our personal coach . # PM: Thank you . Thank you , that was a very good session I think , # UI: is it possible to store this on the share documents or what # PM: because all things are stored in smart board dot X_D_K_ and that's in # ME: But but you can open a from your pr from your laptop . # UI: save it as an image on the res # ME: , maybe . Save as . # ID: Export . Maybe not export function . # UI: and use an image if possible . # UI: J_ PEG . , it's better # ME: Paper size A_ four . screen size . In this directory . # UI: it's not connected to the # PM: You all have the questionnaire again about the after work . # ME: , it is connected . # UI: It's connected ? # ID: I'll just saved in my documents . # ID: in my own in my own messenger . # PM: Project documents , . # UI: It gives the na Oh . # UI: The questionnaire , fill in we fill out d after lunch or # PM: it's simply filling it's also filling out I'd do it after lunch I think . # PM: I'm hungry , so do it after lunch . # PM: Thank you all . # PM: You're welcome . # UI: We can leave the P_C_ on I think , and return to the # PM: I bring it to my personal room . # UI: bring to I gotta bring it home . # ME: To my exave executive # PM: My executive big room with the with the panting .
# ME: Hey , Project Manager . # UI: , Project Manager , I have something to tell you . # UI: I have a little problems with my laptop . # UI: And s so I had a little less time to complete . # UI: No , a little problem , big problem . # UI: I just thought # ME: What was it , problem ? # UI: , it didn't work anymore . # UI: The entire Windows # ME: Project Manager . # ME: You're our Project Manager . # PM: Your project manager . # PM: Welcome to the conceptual design meeting for Real Reaction . # PM: it's the same as the last time . # PM: , also this time there will be three presentations . # PM: And we must reach a decision on the remote control concepts . # PM: , and at the end , I , when I finish it off I have some input from a master class I visited . information . # UI: During lunch , . # UI: He's the master , . # PM: The the concepts on we where we must reach a decision on . , our from are of two sorts . # PM: Components concepts and user interface concepts . # PM: , the first one is really about the total package with Well , we have decided to do a do the with a touch-screen that must be a case around it so it won't be uh as breakable . # PM: how about the energy ? # PM: Can you can you reload it or just have batteries which you must exchange ? # PM: , the user interface concept . , with the type and the supplements . # PM: So where to put what button . # PM: And uh I would say Jans , can you begin ? # PM: At the end , I will take notes and at the end of the minutes will be at the shared folder . # ID: I think it's this one . # ID: Right . , well , I'll be talking about the components . # ID: , what I did was I reviewed previously used items by two different age groups . # ID: below forty five and above . # ID: And I just watch what the differences are and I checked , well , what d do we want , and how can we d aim a at the target group . # ID: Well what I found was that a senior citizens # ID: They , well , they like more the they like the traditional materials , like wood and such more . # ID: Wood and chrome . # ID: And uh they like straightforward shapes . # ID: , they like luxurious styles , where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more soft materials . # ID: Think of the Teletubbies , for instance . # ID: , soft and fluffy and colourful and Well , shapes are curved and round . # ID: Y y you get the picture . # ID: And they like sports and gaming , and that gives them the vitality . # ID: , so w well , firs # PM: One one little question . # PM: about the material . # PM: a soft material for a remote control ? # ID: No , I'll get to that . # ID: You you'll see . # ID: , well f first off , let's start with the energy . # ID: W I had a choice between a few different sources . # ID: But the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery versus kinetic . # ID: kinetic , that's when you move something , then it gets energy . # ID: I figured , well that's ki kinda high-tech , when you have a remote control that well , when you pick it up , it has power . # ID: That would be actually very nice , I figured . # ID: Well , we could also use a battery , that's a bit # ME: but when the power gets low , you have to shake it or something ? # ID: , you c just you have to shake it around a little bit . # ID: And then it d then it has some more energy . # ID: Well , y you could just go for a battery . # ID: Or you can go for both ? # UI: Oh , have you considered the option of using a solar panel ? # ID: , I actually did . # ID: But the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l light . # ID: Well , sunlight preferably . # ID: , and you could you could use normal light , but you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something . # ID: for ultimate b n use of solar panels , you could actually use you could use solar panels , but you ha you'd have to implement them into the remote control , leaving you a bit less space for the interface . # ME: Mm . It's too less space . # ID: so i it wo what's actually I c just in f I've figured it out that well , seeing that you'll always be within the l distance of T_V_ , and the from T_V_ there comes a whole bunch of light . # ID: So it would actually power itself from a T_V_ . # ID: But , well you just take up all the space , and you wouldn't have the full amount of power actually used . # PM: But you prefer kinetic ? # ID: I prefer kinetic because it's well , the costs aren't that much higher , and , ju just a bit more high-tech than a normal battery . # PM: , but you don't move a remote control too much . # ID: I mean , if No , but d Well , you pick it up and you press buttons and y well , you # PM: And that's enough to keep the energy level # ID: , well actually it is . # ID: And it if it isn't , you just shake it a bit and add with power up again . # ID: But , what l what Jarek said , you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . # ID: And for rest , you'd just add juice on the battery . # ME: And when the battery doesn't work , I usually shake it too . So # PM: Thank you , Tim . # ME: Like slamming on it . # ME: It's exactly the same . # ID: And so that well , f furthermore , you we checked the cases . # ID: We have different options concerning the cases . # ID: You ha I you sim you simply add a basic standard model it was kind of square and I figured that's a bit boring . # ID: So you we could go for the single curved or the double curved . # ID: , single curve , it's just a well , you know , it's just a nice curve . # ID: Or but you could go in a in an double curves . And that's like several different dimensions . # ID: That gives you an whole new effec # PM: Dynamic dynamic look ? # ID: , that gives you a younger and more high-tech look , I f I figured . # ID: But , that we'll discuss later . # ME: But , are you going to draw it ? # ID: You want me to draw in three-D_ ? # ME: , I c I can't imagine . # ID: , I ca I ca I could I could show you . I could show you . # ME: I can't imagine how it looks like . # ID: Well let's say y you Let's say that's your standard # ID: That's a bit your d standard design . # ID: But you could actually go like something like this . # ID: And then in three-D_ effect you could go So y you just , this is a this bit difficulty in I didn't take a major in art . # ID: but you could have uh a whole new the back the depth , you could you could just play around a bit with . # ID: You you don't have to use standard # PM: A little artistic . # ID: you could y It leaves more space for creativity . # ID: that might be an idea , but just a Well , furthermore , well , plastic versus rubber ? # ID: You We could choose what what's better , plastic or rubber . # ID: I ch prefer rubber because it feels . # ID: , it's soft and it's that I like soft . # PM: That's the material the younger people want , ain't it ? # ID: I mean plastic is Plastic also has that cheap feeling to it , like plastic Your your I usually associate plastic with something that's cheap . # ID: that's maybe just me , but , we could , oh , talk about it later . # ID: furthermore , buttons . # ID: traditional or a touch screen . # ID: Well , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_ . # ID: And chip set , well if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go with a simple chip set . # ID: But if we decide to go on a n L_C_D_ screen , we would use an we have to use an a advanced chip set . # ID: And that would bring the necessary costs with it . # ID: So that's something we th have to keep in mind . # ID: If it isn't manageable budget-wise , we'd have to go over to sim to simple buttons . # ME: Well , I think we're going to sell tell ten millions of them . # ME: So I bet a big company in Korea or Taiwan , like Samsung , can give us a big discount on the chips , so # ME: U usually , chips are aren't more expensive than one dollar . # ID: , probably , but But , that's # ME: That that shouldn't be a real issue , I think . # ID: That shouldn't be that big a issue . # ID: I'll just add , uh I put a big summary here , so we could discuss it a bit . # ID: what i what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic ? # UI: , I think you should use kinetic as a back-up . # ID: , you should we should # ME: , a combination . # UI: A combination , . # ID: A combination . # ID: , you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic . # ID: When you pick it up , it charges up . # PM: Just like the watch from Seiko . # UI: Psycho-kinetic . # ID: , I con Exactly . # ID: What what do you think ? # PM: I would prefer both too . # PM: Combine them . # ME: Combine them . # ID: , well that would bring the m some more costs , but I mean the Who cares , right . # ID: That's the Project Manager's problem . # UI: Buy a fifty cents battery and # ME: Of course . Fifty cent . # ID: , well Fifty cent , why doesn't And then we have single-curved versus double-curved . # UI: Well maybe I have something in my presentation to cope with that . # ID: No , we'll just wait and , plastic versus rubber . Any ideas ? # UI: , isn't possible to make combination with kind of rubber is or bendable remotes where you've got a . # UI: Or do you think it # ID: , I figured it will be m rather than hard # UI: Rubber casing , . # ID: Nah , rubber c this is a casing , . Rubber casing , # ID: because well if you use an d a touch-screen , it's just a casing around it . # ID: So , you could go for plastic , but I figured # UI: , well d Maybe I can ask it right now the question that I have . # ID: I would choose rubber . # UI: , is it possible of is it necessary to make a touch-screen square ? # UI: It isn't , I think , ? # ID: Well , m I don't know . No . # ME: Well , I think that touch-screens are generally square . # ME: But it's the case you put around it that makes the shape . # UI: We put fashion in electronics , # UI: so maybe we can # ME: but if you have a square L_C_D_ screen , and you put a case around it that has like bulbs or that covers part of the L_C_D_ screen . # ID: , that would cover it . # ID: That that would solve the problem . # UI: Oh , . Okay , I get it . # ME: That's it's custom customisable and # ID: So mm so what are the opinions ? rubber or plastic ? # ID: I prefer rubber . # ID: You you seemed to hesitate a bit . # UI: Well , as long a as long as it's firm , and you don't it's not bendable or something , I th I think that goes too far . # ID: , it shouldn't it shouldn't flop over when you hold it in your hand No , that that's gonna The the chip set will hold it firm in place , and a L_C_D_ screen also # UI: It might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor . # ID: it m might it might . # ID: , tra traditional versus L_C_D_ , well I figured we all set on that . # ID: And , then also the simple versus advanced . # ID: Well I figure if we go for L_ L_C_D_ , we should have the advanced . # ID: So that shouldn't be a problem . # ID: Okay , well that's my # ID: , you're welcome . # ME: Can I do my thing ? # PM: Do your thing , Tim . # UI: Do your thing . # ME: Last week I went to Paris and Milan for some trend-watching . # ME: For marketing . # ME: Our research and development department and I went to Paris and Milan . # ME: In Paris and Milan , we asked different people , differing in age and in income , the amount of money to spend , what they like in design and material nowadays . # ME: Our main audience , so that's people below forty , prefer the following . # ME: At first , the colours of fruit . # ME: Very basic colours , like Janus explained . # ME: , fresh colours , green , red , strawberry red , yellow , banana yellow . # ME: considering material , . They like spongy material , # ME: like a sponge-ball . # ME: Like a s soft material . # ME: Janus m mentioned it also . # ME: I think he did some findings himself . # ID: Well , the Teletubbies sh # ME: You wer you weren't in Paris ? # ME: Okay . Like this . # ME: Like big g flashy colours . Fresh . # ME: It's nice , I think . # ME: Okay , our secondary audience , people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours . # ME: , materials like wood that # PM: , but wood is not a not a material you which you build a remote control of . # ID: Well , you could . You you could . # ME: No n j just j just a w # PM: but never seen one . # ME: No , okay , but just a wooden look . # PM: Case . Oh , a wooden look , . # ME: Like you have those fake panels on the floor . # ME: The that isn't wood anyway , but But , that's our secondary audience . # ME: So , we decided to take mm the people below forty . # ME: So , that this doesn't apply . # ME: 'Kay , the third . # ME: , there're some overall thoughts about new remote controls . # ME: They have to look fancy . # ME: , they should be technological in innovative . # ME: That means there have to be fancy things in . # ME: , and easy to use . # ME: But that's common . # ME: My personal preferences . # ME: We have to aim at a mu at the main audience . And , therefore use fresh colours . # PM: Would you prefer uh that you can choose the colour of your remote control or # ME: , I'll come to that in a second point . # ME: Here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . To customise your own remote control . # ME: Like the Nokia the removable covers , just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one . # ME: , a third , material being used could well be stuff like rubber . # ME: , two advantages . # ME: , it fits within the current market trends . # ME: And it adds safety to your remote when you drop it . So to come back to your question , I think and the people in Milan and Paris also think that the rubber should be pretty hard . # ME: Like seen on regular mobile phones . # ME: Actually , they have a lot in common . The phones and the # ID: Well , I actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote , so . # PM: Maybe you could use your remote as a phone . # PM: There are numbers on it , so # ID: That might be a next step . # ME: , in my second sheet of personal preferences , we have to reconsider the speech function recognition . # ME: , it's very innovative . Innovative . # PM: So that you say S_P_S_S_ , and it goes to # ME: , like something . # ME: You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak speech recognition and stuff . # ME: But , we have to keep the cost in mind , # UI: Twelve fifty # ME: , it can be very expensive . # ME: , building games like Snake or Tetris to amuse the younger users . # ME: , also the link with mobile phones . # PM: , but you don't use that th games when you watching television , I think . # ME: No , okay . But you don't use games when you're d when you're making a telephone call . # ME: It's just the same . # UI: When your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else . # ME: When you're at college . # PM: You take your remote control with you . # ID: You take your remote with you to school . # ME: No . You al you also take t you take your IPac and go play games . # ME: Well , I do that , but Okay , and And third , I stick with it , the log-in functionality with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension . # UI: Okay . the interface contents . # UI: Well that's a just simple PowerPoint mock-up I want to m make it more as dynamic for you so I'll draw there . # UI: But , the main concept is take one big touch screen . # UI: , always display the primary buttons clear and visible . # UI: Maybe even li like this with u uses of a lot of space . # UI: And make the menu structure changeable . # UI: So if you press system , that's , well m multiple system options can , maybe five or ten or one , can fit in . # UI: Or maybe even a step further when you want to t have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button . # UI: And other buttons can may be displayed here if that's necessary . # UI: And well , how do we want to look at uh f Does a remote look Well , it's you've gotta hold it in one hand . # UI: So the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small , so you can put it in inside your hands . # UI: And some remotes you can use with your thumb . # UI: But I think that's too difficult for this one . # UI: So you can make it s a little broader . And here ? # UI: And maybe use your thumb on the on the main buttons . # UI: And use your other hands on the menu structure . # UI: So here are gonna be the program buttons . One , two , three , four , et cetera . # UI: And the volume control and program control maybe . # UI: And , down here , I added , this could be one big L_C_D_ . , the menu structure . # UI: So you can use it in this way . # UI: One thing you've gotta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time . # UI: , know that if you are changing the menu structure here , And well , I still believe you should keep displaying the buttons . # UI: But if you're programming the colour of the T_V_ , do not display twenty other options that are possible . # UI: Just keep it as simple as possible . # UI: And do not use too many levels . # UI: Do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un-plus , and push plus twenty times . # UI: But just the just in one button if possible . # UI: And , well , you kn you all know the T_V_ levels . # UI: , channel one , two . And when you get to n to ten , ye and want to go back , well you have a problem . # UI: Just m most modern T_V_s , you press one zero , and it goes to ten . # UI: And else , to one and through after that . # UI: So the s a button less . # UI: And , things like teletext , put them in the menu . # UI: Things like um # ME: what do you think about a back-and-forth come-up button ? # UI: , w , I find I must trying to tell it . # ME: L like in internet explorer . # UI: Is volume plus and minus ? # UI: And this is program plus and minus . # ME: okay , but does it that is for going from four to five . # ME: But if you go from two to eight , and you want # UI: Or if you're watching Studio Sports on seventeen , and your wife is watching some soap on two # ME: That you can switch easy . # UI: Well yes , I think that's a good idea . # UI: But , well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure . # UI: And if you're using that button a lot of times , well of course the menu will still be displayed on the screen . # UI: You just don't have to play games in-between . # UI: But if you're really switching between two channels , you won't have time to d use the other options . # UI: , already told that . # UI: That's my conclusion . # PM: I think we can discuss a little about the three kind of revolutionary things Tim came with . # PM: The parental control , the games , and the voice recognition . # PM: There's n not too much decision on that one so I think that parental control is a good function to put in the remote . # PM: I don't know how you think about it . # UI: Well , I agree , just put it in the menu structure somewhere . # UI: , system properties , parental control . # ME: What I see How I see it is you put it on the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents , children . # ME: Something like that . # ME: And w when you want to use the parents option , you have to # UI: It it has to be fast . # UI: You don't want to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings . # PM: No but I think most people find it much more important that their children don't watch sex or violence on the television , and wait ten or fifteen seconds longer , so they can finally watch it because of that . # UI: You c may use like when there's X_P_ , a simple log-on , d you just push one or two or three . # ME: Pu push parents . # UI: And if you push parents , then # ME: That then you have to go to three-digit log-in . # UI: And if you puts a ye # ME: Like two one three . # UI: And if you w you push p children , you don't have to log in , but you can only watch children's channels or # ME: It automatically goes . # ID: I don't know if it's worth the time and effort we are going to spend on it . # ID: Because well it's a simple function , but it's gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time to programming it . # ID: Because you'll have to start working with the profiles and such . # ID: And I'm not sure if it's actually worth investing that much time and effort into it . # PM: Well I think that's a b there's a big market for it , # ID: I don't know what # PM: because you , you read many times in magazines same kind of stuff , and you heard on the news that he , they believe that children are influenced by the television , # PM: Well , we're aiming to below forty years . # PM: But there are a lot of people will below forty who have children in young age who want to not watch violent or # UI: Well , maybe some idea on that . # UI: Just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , 'cause if my grandad would buy this remote , he wouldn't want to bother with all the all the things to do . # UI: Just make it an option in menu , ins install powerful profiles or something . # PM: That's a that's a better idea ? # ME: w It just has to be w when it's deliver out of the store , it has to be just simple and plain . # ME: But if you want to install it personally If I got kids , and I could choose between two remote controls . One w with parent control and one without , and I would buy the one with . # PM: , with and one without . # UI: , b well , still some question I have about how to incorporate those ones . # UI: You're thinking about some channels they cannot see , but well , I when I think , oh , for the f for all the standard channels , and only for maybe after ten o'clock in the evening violent films and movies will come and maybe some timing will be needed instead of channels , because if you're watching , I don't know , you're in the at day , cartoons will come up m on maybe Friday night . I don't know . # PM: , maybe it can work with show view . # PM: , you can control your video recorder with show view . # PM: , when you tick in a number , it will start and end recording . # PM: But maybe there's some option that t the kind of show view numbers are violent , and that they are blocked out . # UI: the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show-view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all , # UI: will have to decide # ME: but that isn't possible . # UI: That isn't possible . # ID: But , well , if you want to I i if we in incorporate the parental control , let's say we do , and well whatever , cho child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up for instance . # ID: Well , nob nobody's stopping the child from well checking the channel . # UI: Well , you could say if parental control is only it it'll go from fourteen to sixteen with the page-up then , but # ID: But that Well , I'm not sure because for that to happen , you d you will have to receive a signal from the remote control , so it would , have to be constant signalling . # ID: What m what may be better is to incorporate an a separate device that you can program with the remote control . # ID: And that provides parental control , for instance . # ID: And that's just an optional device . # ID: So there's n that's there's besides the remote control , you'll have a separate # PM: I wouldn't put it in an optional device . # PM: That that then it becomes too much , I think . # PM: If we do it , we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile , a parent profile , and a family profile , and otherwise . # UI: , on a separate menu option . # ME: And and you know w when you install another device , children can still go up to the T_V_ , p pop open the thing and g # ID: that's true . That's true , # ME: go to a channel . # ID: but at same instant , same happens when you have remote control . So # ID: But , only difference is the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control , and those people wouldn't necessary want it . # ID: So , you you'd be # ME: But it's just an added feature . # PM: Okay . And what do you guys think of the games in the voice recognition ? # PM: I personally think that becomes too much . # PM: It's more like it gets you to the functionality , but # UI: A mail too from management that it's very popular to use voice recon recognition . # UI: But I don't think when you're watching T_V_ , hearing loud noises from the T_V_ , someone screaming one , and you f the channel switches , . # ME: , like f voice recognition is too much , I think . But # ME: games . It doesn't # ID: I can see games happening . # UI: W you can put it on chip anyway , so # UI: As long as it's isn't a primary feature of the remote , # ME: That that doesn't c that doesn't co , that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources , I think . # PM: So that will that must be in it , you think ? # ID: , that will be nice . # PM: Okay . So the games are in it . # PM: The voice recognition are not . # PM: And the parental control are # ME: , it's in it . But too ma I think so , but # UI: But how we do it ? # UI: Well , I think also it's a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . # UI: So we should make it too complex . # UI: Is t some menu function , you choose parental control , and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on . # UI: But how it's gonna work uh will f be a problem . # PM: , but will there uh Like the first idea from You can buy it without and with parental contr control ? Or are we going to put it in and just # UI: Ye I think best would be to put it in and make it an menu option . # UI: You can put on # ME: , to put it in always . # UI: And you can just s when you buy it , you can select personal preference , parental control on , and the password or something . # ID: Well , I don't know . # ID: I figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with well uh a receiver in it . # ID: So you could actually easily build in parental control . # ID: But it would be more expensive . # ID: So , a and that way you could make cheap model and a expensive model . # ID: Could ma make the simple model and the deluxe model , for instance . # ME: , but T_V_s aren't capable of sending . # ME: I thought they were just # ID: , you have some T_V_s any # ME: a able to receive . # PM: , but most often not . # ID: That is true , that is true . # UI: Well , maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you cannot watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock . # UI: And there's just some little clock in the remote . # ID: Well , you could you could easily you could easily you could easily to the mote control . # ME: , j just some rules . # ID: But you still have the problem about the television itself . # UI: No , no , it's very simple . # UI: There th I h I've seen some of remotes who have a clock in it . # UI: So , the remote does doesn't transmit when it's after twelve clock . # ME: But , on the T_V_ at least my T_V_ , is a is a compartment which you can press . # ME: And there are buttons behind it which you can use , if you d if you don't if you don't have a # UI: Well , that's To put it very blunt , that's not our problem . # UI: Just have the parents buy some glue and It's not a part of the remote . # ID: , that is true . , that is true . # ID: , you could you could you could go like # UI: , or make it ourselves very diffic # ID: that would actually make things a lot more easy . # ID: You could just blame it on television and make it their problem . # ID: , I figured I figure we could do that . , sure . # ID: , I'm not sure what marketing thinks about it , but # ME: I have to consult my legal advisor about it . # PM: Okay . So I think we have decided on the things that from Janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic . # PM: The case will be double-curved and rubber , in a fr flashy fruity colour that with cover is removable . # PM: The buttons will be touch-screen . but there may not be too many buttons . # PM: And in the menu structure , there must not to be Five minutes to go . # PM: , too many levels . # PM: And it must be easy to use . # PM: The parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex . # PM: And the games are in it . # PM: I think we have we have decided , okay . # ME: Oh . Oh . I have one thing left . # ME: Maybe for Jerome . # UI: ? I'm listening . # ME: Maybe it's handy to build in an expert view and a simple view . # PM: Like a like a moat or s or something . # ID: User profile . # ME: Like at In the experts view , you have a lot of more buttons . # PM: , but you have that in the # UI: What I was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you don't use it is simple . # UI: And when you push system properties , entire list pops up with e ev all kind of f stuff you can program . # PM: It's already incorporated a little in that concept . # ME: Mm , okay . Fairly enough . # ID: Well , you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users . # ME: , wh which buttons you like or not . # ID: , which buttons do you want to in it . # ID: Because you can you can like build in a back-forward button , and some po somebody would just want to watch two channels . # ME: Just leave the other numbers away . # ID: , you could you could m have people want that . # PM: We take it to the other meeting , I have a little w little chat to do # PM: and then we finish . # ME: A little chat . # PM: I went to a master class and uh two things are can come in handy for us . # PM: First thing is we talked about knowledge management . # PM: Knowledge engineering and uh the fact that the idea of knowledge , sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is like that . # PM: It's it's very hot at the moment , so it's mostly for the management expert to look what other # PM: marketing or did I said management ? # PM: Just talking about myself . # ME: , that's my function , to Okay . Go on . # PM: What other companies had to also with the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote , just some . Import export . # PM: And another one . # UI: Som some bench-marker . # PM: , they're a ha they're at , benchmarking , that's the word I saw . # PM: I couldn't Okay , another thing is there were there was a survey , and it came out that people like to buy things from a single large provider , instead of those who are partnering with us . # PM: So , we must we must bring it as if Real Reaction is big company , a trustful company , and it has m # ME: I know a marketing name for our product . # ME: R_ th R_ to the third power . # ME: R_ three . Real Reaction remote . # PM: I had a I had another idea to put uh the whole the whole idea of Real Reaction and uh a single brand and uh that kind of thing . # PM: When you put on remote , you see a kind of a just like when you telephone , you see a little animation . # PM: Real Reaction remote . # PM: And with the with the with the motto , we put fashion in electronics . # PM: And then you go # ME: , okay , but it has to be like a split second , because you have to put in a code also and # UI: Well , you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds , they'll still remember it . # PM: But w th the idea from this thing is that we must present it as a as we are a single large provider who will stand on our own . # UI: And it l linger on every time you see it . # ID: Well , if you if you have the l L_C_D_ screen , you can you can have a small logo i at the bottom . # ID: And it could just stay there . # ME: That spins around like all the time . # UI: Very annoying . # ID: , that spins around or something . # ME: It it's just like a globe in Internet Explorer . # ID: , something like that . A small icon . # PM: Okay , but think about that kind of things . # PM: That's what they said in the master class . # UI: Oh , for the next meeting , right ? # PM: N , next meeting starts in thirty minutes . # PM: So maybe you can go to Paris and Milan once again . # ME: Who who gave you the master class ? # PM: The master class ? # ME: Ronald Betenberg ? # PM: Franz Mehler's . # PM: , very special , next session . # PM: idea that you the industrial development centre and user interface will work together on a prototype . # PM: And will drawing it on the SMARTboard . # PM: So that's a kinda new thing . # PM: And , the marketing expert will ke he will be keeping busy with the product evaluation . # PM: But the most specific instructions will be sent to you by email . # ID: So we're going to work together right now ? # UI: Stay here and # PM: , the well , dids this what I what I heard . # ME: In the master class . # PM: Not in the master class . # PM: So you just wait for the specific instructions and But I think it was a very good session , gentlemen . # PM: I will thank you all . # ID: Well thank you too . # UI: Thank you . Thank you very much . # ME: Thank you too , lord . # PM: Give me a good evaluation . # ME: 'Kay guys , lot of success . # PM: See you in a half hour . # PM: But keep an eye on your laptops for a real # ID: , I'm not sure if we Because I saw something about individual actions . # PM: , but th there's still the my instructions that you will work together . # PM: That's not my problem . # UI: Stupid manager . # PM: The project manager always works alone . # ID: Do you have new email ? # UI: Don't get what's .
# PM: Wouldn't wanna be Project Manager . # PM: , what we going to do . # PM: , once again I'm gonna take minutes . # PM: So , no presentation for me . # PM: , first we have a prototype presentation by G_ and G_ . # PM: Afterwards some eval evalu # UI: Evaluation criteria . # PM: evaluation crit criteria . # PM: , in combination with the finance I received a an Excel file which we have to fill in later on . # PM: , and then we must see if we stay under the twelve and a half Euro . # ME: Interesting . # PM: So , that's a big # ID: That's gonna be t problem . # PM: l so let's wait it we have we have must , # UI: Some creative # PM: we must have some time for that because it will be , quite a lot of mathematics . # PM: And after that , uh an evaluation of the process how we how we have done it here with the SMARTboard , with the with our laptops , with the all this . # PM: And afterwards , we closing . # PM: Once again , forty minutes , so let's start . # PM: I would g give the word to G_ and G_ for the prototype presentation . # UI: Shall I give a short introduction and then # ME: Jane and Jane . # ME: 'Kay guys , take it away . # UI: , this was our first concept . # UI: We decided to use a single touch-screen . # UI: So , we've worked out this concepts , how to how to hold it , where to put the buttons and stuff . # UI: And , well , we began with a form of shape , that is easy to hold w in one hand , left or right handed . # UI: So , we made i it a little bit less thick and it has some ar artistic meaning . # UI: This isn't nothing . # UI: Idea maybe is better . # UI: well , during the meeting I showed you the concept of placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb , and the menu structure , if necessary , with your other hand , so it's just gonna hold it easily . # UI: And it has to be acce accessible with your other hand too , of course . # UI: So we began working out a concept . # ID: , well , and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel L_C_D_ screen . # ID: Well , these would be the main buttons , h you could change them later on in your own profile if you want to . # ID: But , well it's standard they will be delivered with this kind of set-up . # ID: We have the more advanced menu setting right here . # ID: We have the sub-menus and stu stuff . # ID: We made a top oh , or a front view . # ID: Just so like you wanna back view . # ID: As you can see , this there , there are two weird bumps in it . # ID: This is for the added effect of well y youth and dynamic . # ID: And this is for the artistic effect . # ID: Well , what we figured is we'll show you a picture later on you have more b a better idea after that . # ID: But , idea is for to stay in balance with these two with these two . # ID: And so when you put it on the table , it will just lay down . # ID: It won't roll around or stuff . # ID: But it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe , or like these old phones . # ID: Y you may get the idea . # ID: So thi this is about how we figured it should be . # ID: The s panel we g you would hide with some more rubber layers , like we discussed early on . # ID: , you would s you wouldn't see the straight panel , but more fluidly and round . # UI: the panel just of course goes like this . # UI: But the overlaying layer is a little bit curved and stuff . # ID: And , in these bumps you could actually put some electronics that would you can make a more thinner design , and that would actually look very nice , . # ID: And , about the colour , what have # UI: Oh , we added that this can be held with your hands for this maximum is om , one and a half centimetres . # UI: So , you have room here for your battery and maybe even other electronic chips . # UI: S and you can just be the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as thin as possible in the middle for good grip . # ID: , f , as colours , do you do you have the picture in Now , well this is the idea about the bumps . # ID: , you can see there's a v a very youthful dynamic exterior . # ID: you just want to hold it you are young and dynamic like us . # ME: it's like an Easter egg . # ID: , it's like an e but this is for children . # ID: We we want a more adult version . # ID: But , this is like a remote control for children . # PM: It's called a weemote # ID: Hey , that's actually a brilliant marketing stand . # ME: Wait what I w got in mind . # ID: So this actually basic the idea . # ID: We we just want to build a more adult vers adult version of this . # PM: , I can imagine that . # ID: And and for colours , we figured starting with basic colours like white or metallic grey . # ID: Those are the technological colours actually , # UI: It would be best to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable , so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple , # ID: Or blue or whatever . # UI: but when the o older people go in the shop and they see an orange remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one . # UI: And young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible , they think , I'll buy for a couple of Euros some noi nice hip # ME: Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover , so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop . # UI: I think a cover is necessary , 'cause als otherwise you'll just have the L_C_D_ screen . # UI: So , there must be some cheap standard cover , maybe white or something , that's could comes with it and you can buy , so we can make extra money . # PM: , but you d you mustn't forget that our target aim is younger people . # PM: , we had decided to put some flashy fruity colours in it , and in the survey from Milan and Paris it came out that uh the d the older people are more willing to spend money on extra features . # PM: So I think it will be a better idea to have some flashy fruity colours as a standard , # UI: The other way around , you mean . # PM: and for the people who really want a more sophisticated , more traditional look , they're willing to pay that . # PM: They want they want more luxury stuff , but they have the money to do it and they want to b to buy that . # PM: So , maybe it's an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard . # ID: , maybe , perhaps you're right . # ID: , I would I would actually agree with this sounds logical . # ME: An another idea . # ME: , maybe we could develop a cover with wood style . # ME: They'll please the elder users as well . # UI: a colour of a wood style , a white c and a couple of h hip fruity colours . # UI: And lea l delivered standard with a fruity colour , but not too not too much . # UI: This is banana and mango , not purple or p orange and yellow . # PM: But , the mai I think th the standard must be some kind of uh attractive flashy colours . # PM: Not too , but w a little , because that's our aim . # ID: li like this like this . # ID: This isn't this isn't too much , is it ? # PM: Well , the buttons don't have to be all of # ME: Well I think so . # ME: , except for the buttons it's it could be a standard model . # ID: something like this would be nice . # ID: Okay , that's it from us . # ME: 'Kay , it's my time now . # PM: The Marketing Expert . # ME: During the During the design life-cycle we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and stuff . # ME: , now is the time to evaluate our prototype concept to the past requirements . # ME: So we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis . # ME: , we're going to do that with a seven point scale . # ME: Opening a Word document now . # ME: oh , okay , I have to expla explain something . # ME: We have to be consensive about things . # ME: So , it has to be a group decision . # PM: so we gon we gonna evaluate the # ME: We're going to vote . # PM: , the thing we saw . # ME: ? The prototype . # PM: Okay , just saw . # ME: The remote control is designed for people with age below forty . # ME: Seven is false . # ID: , it's not just designed for people under the age of forty . It's also designed for people above forty . # ME: so a o one is appropriate ? # UI: No no , a little more in the middle . # ME: Or , more like a four . # ID: , two or three , because it's not just the qu question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty . # ID: But it's also designed for people of age above forty . So , # ID: I'll say it's about three . # UI: it will be primary appealing to m minus forty , but also appealing to # ME: But also for , okay . # ME: The remote control is beautiful . # ME: acco according to us , it's one ? Or # UI: it's the marketing angle on television . # UI: We have a wonderful # ME: Of c of course you have to be very positive and enthusiastic about your own product . # UI: Well , it's also fancy then . # ME: , the remote control looks fancy . # UI: Of course . We have a perfect remote . # ME: The remote control has big , clear channel switching buttons . # UI: oh they have to agree but # ID: Leads to user face , . # UI: I'm the User Interface Expert . # ME: , teletext buttons and volume buttons ? # PM: No teletext buttons . # PM: Teletext is in the menu . # UI: You you've different menu . # UI: And volume is impo # PM: Volume is true . # ME: Big and clear ? # ID: , the they are big and clear . # UI: , big and clear . # PM: , big and clear . # UI: But you could make a teletext button six . # UI: Otherwise , the people who read this are gonna think we have no teletext button . # ID: , but the teletext button . , you can ch That's in a menu . # ID: So , it's w , it isn't entirely unclear , So , I wouldn't give it a seven . # ID: I would give it a more a five or a six . # ID: , I don I don't know . # ID: What do you think , Mister Project Manager ? # PM: Oh , okay . Well , I agree . # PM: I was thinking very black and white . # UI: Black and red . # UI: Okay , don't forget to save it . # ME: The remote control is easy to be found . # UI: well , when we put in fancy colours , # ID: , it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape . # ID: So , if you so if you have trouble finding it # UI: But , it it's not making any sound , have we deciding ? # ME: Oh , okay , If you put your normal remote control under your bed , or you throw this remote control under your bed , is it better findable ? # UI: It'll make a difference . # UI: We have the better re I don't know . # UI: My remote control's black . # ME: A li little bit maybe ? # UI: A little bit , but . # PM: Well , we p we can do it glow in the dark . # PM: So , if it's in the dark place , you still see it glowing . # ME: It's it's it doesn't really make a lot of # ID: Well , then I'll go for four . # ID: Because four is between three and uh also between true and false . # UI: , okay , you're right . # ME: Yes , but five is between four and six . # ID: so I'll go for four . # PM: , you must see it as , w according to the other remote controls , there may uh be there in your T_V_ room , this one will stand out , I think . # ID: , that that's a better question actually . # PM: I think that that's what it's about . # UI: If your fifteen remotes in a drawer , you find it , ? # PM: if this lying on your couch , you're you think what's that for kinda orange thing . # ME: But but the survey under users was that they really lost it . # UI: , that's stupid . # ME: Like , no not seeing it , but lost it in the house or something . # UI: , but when you lost it you're just not # ID: Well , if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere , then you'd recognise it as , whoa , that is strange . # PM: That's our remote control . # UI: , mostly when you lose your remote control , it it's under your # ME: , okay . , I agree , I agree . # UI: Most of times when you lose it you're sitting on it . # ME: the remote control has fresh , fruity colours . # UI: I would call choose two , 'cause we decided not to make two f fresh colours , as it would not . # ME: , not too flashy . # ME: The remote control is made of soft material . # ID: , rubber , is kind of soft . # PM: , but not too soft we have decided . # UI: kinda soft , but not this . # PM: Easy to use . One . # PM: , can it be zero ? # ID: Well , I don , it is kind of # ME: Top easy to use ? # ME: It's it's not the most easy to use # UI: you can do two , because # ME: It can be easier . # UI: it can be easier . # UI: But then you're l # ME: Jus just with ten buttons , that's the easiest . # UI: , but then you'll lose function f , functionality and our fancy look , so . # ID: Functional ability . # ME: , but the most easy to use is just with one button # UI: It is r it is rather easy to use , because you have the primary buttons always visible . # ME: , okay , but easy n not the most easy to use , I think . # ID: No , it's it I I'll go for two . # ID: My vote's on two . # ME: We also have to compare it to the to the remote controls on the market nowadays . So # UI: , but waits just a minutes . # UI: Inspiration . # PM: What's the time ? # PM: We also have to do the evaluation , the production costs and stuff . # UI: These are the m regular remotes . # ME: The remote control is innovative . # PM: You're agree , Tim ? # PM: You haven't seen a more innovative thing in Paris ? # ME: The remote control has m remova removable from Multilux . # UI: Very multifunctional . # ME: The remote control , i it has speech recognition . # UI: This is used with speech recognition , this . # ME: The remote control has built-in games ? # UI: But , maybe make it two , because the games are in a sub-menu and not it's not an entire game . # PM: , but they are built in , so it's one . # ID: , they are built in . # ME: And the last , paren parental advisory function . # ID: You really like the parental advisory . # UI: Th did you make this or the # UI: It changes it maybe . # ME: Okay , I will do the math . # ME: Now it's your turn . # PM: Okay , we have now to c to calculate the production cost . # PM: If it's under twelve and half Euro , then it's ok okay . # PM: But i is it if it is b No , this isn't right . # PM: Okay so , . Redesign . # UI: If they're under twelve fifty . # PM: Oh , if they under . # UI: ? Cau 'cause so it's okay . # PM: , if the costs are under twelve and a half Euro , then we can ra move on to the project evaluation , as we have experienced it . # PM: Otherwise , we have do have to do a little redesign thingy . So , we have to fill in the numbers of the component components . # PM: We have to fil , want to do it in and see if we stay under the twelve and a half Euro . # PM: So , do we have a hand dynamo ? # UI: Battery , yes . One . # PM: Okay , solar cells , zero . # PM: Okay , simple chip on print ? # PM: No , advanced chip . # ME: Advanced chip . # PM: Sample sensor sample speaker ? # UI: No , the advanced chip is # ME: Advanced chip is three . # ME: Three Euros , yep . # PM: , but it it's one thing , it's three Euro . # ID: , we have one . We have one # ME: Okay , one piece , . # PM: , what's the sample sensor ? # ME: Speech recognition , I think . # UI: you give it a sample , one . # ID: , speech recognition # PM: , uncurved flat . # PM: But is it s it's not made from a single uncurved thingy and then and then # PM: So it's only once double-curved . # UI: 'cause the layer around it fits around the bubbles on the o on the back of the # PM: We're now in a problem , 'cause we have reached eleven Euro yet . # UI: , we don't have anything else . So # ME: Okay , go on . Just go on . # ID: Then we'll see we'll see wha how much we are over budget . # UI: Could you step a little to the right ma Oh , sorry . # UI: Special is the special colour ? # PM: Special colour ? # ID: I don't think so . # ID: No , this is a standard colour . # PM: , but we want to make the wood colours , that # ID: Yes , this is a special colour . # UI: , if you're honest , we'll type one , special colour . # ME: , but D but Daniel , tha that's another brand . # ID: That's an add-on . # ME: That's another article to sell . # PM: , but we going to yeah , that's true . # UI: , j maybe we'll finish the list first and then look back , aye ? # ME: That doesn't account for this . Producing this . # PM: the push-button , no . # UI: Scroll wheel , no . # PM: Scroll-wheel , no . # PM: we don't have a s # ID: Well , we're only four Euro over budget . # PM: So , what's the thing we can change ? # ID: Well , other case , we can make it single-curved or uncurved . # PM: , can I say something ? # UI: Mm , single-curves . # PM: No , can I say something as Project Manager ? # PM: The kinetic thing , can we just skip it , # UI: Just cut off the kine # PM: because you have to shake it , but that's not really innovative . # UI: we just put a good battery it . # UI: Mobile phones nowadays . # ME: Daniel . Daniel , what do you think about Here . # ME: What do you think about putting a battery in it , but also selling like the covers , a docking station just apart from the from the thing , so that you can put rechargeable batteries in it and just # UI: But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual . # PM: , and not really . # PM: if you forget about the kinetic , # UI: that's a cost reduc # PM: well if we do that , we shall . # ID: well you can go from double-curved to single-curved . # ID: And that would solve the budget problem . # PM: , b but i but the single-curved is just oh # UI: so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then No , it's just one curve and not a back curved I think . Or # ID: It's just well , the single-curve that # PM: So that's wh tha that's one option . # UI: Or are these two curves ? # PM: And then w , and then we could have it , but it's its' well it's r it is the main point of the look . # UI: but what else do we have to cut out ? # UI: No advanced chip , that's a little bit of problem . # ID: We going to cut # PM: No , tho that can be done . # UI: Although , can we make it with a regular chip ? # PM: okay , a little less conversation . # ME: Hey , those ar arcs , why are there for ? # UI: Explanation . # PM: explanation . # UI: Twelve fifty . # PM: I can delete it for you if you want . # PM: So , if we do this , we're on twelve and a half Euro . # PM: And we're done . # UI: but does it fit with our design ? # PM: well , the only thing that don't # UI: Do we have to u adapt it ? # UI: It's single-curves . # PM: , single-curved , but there's a curve in it . So # UI: Could we just make the bubbles cut off the back , and then we're has # ID: , we just make it flat . # ME: But , wha 'Kay , look , what is the If you make it double-curved , it costs one Euro more . # UI: You make it optional . # ME: but does it have a lot of extra # ME: fun function more like # ID: Worth , does it have added worth ? # UI: , there's an a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality . # PM: , it's really a static value . # ME: I mean , you make like eleven and a half Euros profit instead of twelve and a half . # ME: But I don't know if twelve and a half is a fixed price . # ID: , well let's assume it is . # ME: No , we can't go above that . # ID: We we should assume it i that it is . # ID: But I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion . # ME: , okay . Then it's okay . # ID: R if you promote a kinetic I kinetic remote control , I mean , that would b sell better than an a normal remote control . # PM: Well , now you can shake your remote control . # ID: No , well , y I mean , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k remote control is kinetic . # ID: You have standard old battery control remote con # ME: What a what about all the m the environment freaks ? # UI: , but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile . So # ME: Not freaks , the envi I think it's It look like this one . # UI: You ma can make an especialised extra gold version . # PM: because if you want to go to kinetic , you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat , and I think now it's more of a compromise And if you make the single curve ha just a big curve , then it's then it's # UI: , just one big curve . # PM: , one big good curve . # PM: I was going to say nasty words , but I don't . # PM: This is strange by the way . # PM: Wood is m is cheaper than rubber . # PM: We thought that wood would be more expensive . # UI: , this American figures . # UI: You just cut down some trees . # PM: But that this is this is it ? # PM: Okay , this is it . # UI: Whoever makes a remote control out of titanium . # PM: I'm gonna save it . # ID: It is possible , but you can't use double curves for titanium . # ID: That's one of the functionability # PM: Okay , well , considering we have # ME: no , we have to do all those hours again . # ME: Costs on No redesign . # PM: Well , we were above , so we did a little redesign # UI: We , we'll start her all o all over again . # PM: now it's about time to talk about this project . # PM: Were there room for was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ? # ME: I didn't think so . That there was a lot of room for it . # ME: But , that's mainly because of the information that was delivered to us . # ME: It was just fixed information and get your stuff from there , and I couldn't go on i on the internet and search my own stuff . Bu # PM: That's true . I agree with that . # ID: Well , I th I think you two , especially you and Daniel , you d you both had the less creative roles in the project . # UI: For us , there was a lot of creativity . # ID: 'Cause I think m # UI: We could just sign up an remote if we liked . # ID: I think Jeroen and I , we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than you two . # PM: how about the leadership ? # ME: Leadership was crappy . # ID: Nah , the leadership wasn't crappy , it was the leader that was crappy . # PM: Okay , thank you very much . # ID: the leadership was okay . # PM: Now we're done . # UI: , example of crappy leadershi # ME: No , leadership was # ME: I thought the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting . # ME: , you could have but , it was your first , no disrespect or something , but you could have structure it a l little bit more . # ME: So like , I was talking most of the time the first meeting , and # UI: You could of said , shut up you fool . # PM: I notice it too . # PM: I was a I was also very unhappy , very unsatisfied about the # PM: about the first meeting . # PM: So , I hope uh the other meetings # ID: Try to learn from your mistake . And we will never do it again . # PM: get better and I think the last two meetings also we reached some good decisions about talk # ME: No , it you did better . # UI: , more consensus . # UI: Ev everybody w was agreeing every # ME: Much more constructive . # PM: Okay , so that's cool . # PM: Well , maybe that's only well , it's for us , because # UI: Well , we work together on a project , but everybody has his own task . # PM: and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed . # UI: So , it is a little bit # PM: But , really teamwork were you two # UI: Well , it went okay . # ID: , that went w it went well . # UI: Stupid stupid pen , but # PM: No hard feelings . # ID: Nah . , we had some trouble with the pen , but # PM: Now you must push a little while . # UI: but draw something difficult . # UI: D just write your name right now . # UI: Try to write your name , in writing letters , of course , ? # UI: , normally , this the w Block letter sign it , ? # UI: Just just write your name in one line . # UI: If it's a little bit too small bit quicker now . # PM: You can be you can go quicker , 'cause then it won't notice it . # UI: It didn't he knows how it works , . # PM: I follow the Master class for the SMARTboard , so I think that's the that's the main issue . # PM: , so about this one you were you're dealing with , the digital pen . # UI: Th the i The idea is great , but it doesn't work properly . # ME: Digital pen , I thought th the first time I did individual work , I used it . # ME: But , a and the first two meetings I brought it with me , but I didn't use it at all after the first the first meeting . # ID: No , I have it working . # ME: It's it's not real use for me . # ID: No , it doesn't have that much added value to the # UI: As as I said a m a c few moments ago , it I would like , myself , to write with a normal pen , because must , it's almost the same concept , but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner . # UI: I it's the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s very slow . # PM: And it is still your own handwriting popping up in Word . # UI: Yes . No , and it doesn't give any added value . # PM: No , that's true . No . # ME: Not really , no . # PM: And the SMARTboard is useful , but the pen is I not user-friendly , I think . # UI: , not user-friendly . # PM: Be it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things , # UI: , and it's not very precise . # PM: and that's the # UI: We're trying to m to # ME: like when you do this . # UI: , and tr try to wri write your name in a in a normal size , . # UI: Just like when you're writing on a letter . # PM: , but that's not th the you when you at a foreign audience , you b don't gonna wr write small . # UI: a as you saw on this drawing , just open this one or that one . # UI: It's th it , we had more problems even here when we trying to draw these buttons , it's almost impossible to get clear when you're # PM: But maybe there's some function with no , it isn't . # UI: And the eraser was another problem . # UI: It w t is this large . # UI: And when you try to erase this line , y # PM: Well , I'm gonna erase my name . # UI: I'm gonna erase my name there . # PM: , it's a big eraser . # UI: M Abo What kind of new ideas ? # PM: Well , the idea of the touch-screen is I'm just # UI: New ideas about the working of this software , about the project , about the remote controls or # PM: I don't know what I mean . # ME: Did you heard what he said ? # ID: Know what I mean . # ME: I don't know what I mean . # ME: Oh , I have some figure . # ME: The eva the evaluation , the mm the mean number is one point eight one point eight six . # PM: That's interesting . # ME: So that's fairly good , I think . # PM: because what does it mean ? # PM: All the mo , are between one and two . # ME: all the requirements are true or very true , right . Yep . # PM: Thank you , expert . # PM: But the new ideas found for wi with working with this software ? # UI: Not really , just they have to improve it . # UI: the concept is okay , # UI: but it has to be quicker . # UI: , it is still opening my programme , n almo almost my entire computer is locked up during the process and it , just takes too many time . # UI: People will still feel the need to write it quickly on a page and not download it and save it , and # PM: You had expected it to be more # UI: More user-friendly . # UI: 'Cause when you use a pen , you can just draw like you d draw normally , and you do # ME: May maybe the idea you proposed is a screen here . # ME: And draw it , and it's placed over there . # UI: Would be easier . # UI: Or at least when you don't have to adapt to the technology , just you can write in the way you normally write . # UI: And now you have to keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen . # UI: And that's a very bad concept . # UI: Nah , okay , I it's my opinion that I # ME: I think this is better than regular flip-overs , # UI: , it's can be saved easier . # UI: But if you're in normal flip-over you a lot of people write text . # UI: There's no text option . # UI: And writing text , you've gotta really do your best to write some # PM: and maybe some functions for uh circle or a square . # PM: You have to draw it yourself now . # UI: Or maybe even insert picture . # UI: If you have some presentation , and you have some f # ID: Or text function . # ID: Just t type text , and that would be excellent . # ME: but insert image isn't available ? # UI: 'Cause then you could # ME: Here . Picture from scanner , clip-art . # PM: , that can be done already . # PM: But not the predefined squares I think # ME: Hey , what if you do like hyperlink ? # UI: With W_W_ dot Google dot com . # ME: Re Real Reaction dot N_L_ . # ME: Yes , is now is okay . # UI: You'll just make a link in # PM: Well , that's nice . # UI: There's one way to # ME: 'Kay , double-click it . # UI: Maybe if you're not using the eraser # ME: You're erasing . # UI: Something else th # ME: Double-click it . # PM: as you saw , you have a little Oh , you can thank you . # PM: You can go So there the functionality is there , but it's not it's not ideal , and it's very it costs a lot of time to And that's a pity , if you if you have thirty , forty minutes for this kind of things , and we are now with four people , # PM: well , imagine you are here you're with the ten people and everyone # UI: That's mostly the case , from the over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case , and if you have to do all this kind # PM: Two minutes of drawing , . # UI: You'll rather use PowerPoint and work it out in advance . # UI: And th the one or two things you have to draw when you're there , just use a flip-board . # ME: What I really miss also is a d is a turtle is a decision system With the evaluation , you have to Polls like , what do you want , a one , a two , maybe a l a little application like uh give your own number and click one two three four five six seven . # PM: , just like he said with the with the a screen which you can write , also a kind of voting mechanism . # ME: , j ju , v voting application . # ME: Just a little group decision application . # ID: But , problem is , well you can't discuss anything well you ca you can , but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now . # ID: We I mean w one person s maybe said three . # ID: But , well I we said , no I w th think two , because this and this , and then you can react on it . # ID: But if you put a three on it , just figure well , everybody knows what I'm knowing , so they'll all just put a two on . # ME: of course . But , you can still discuss about it , # ME: but click it in an application , that's a lot easier to process . # ID: okay , the for processing part . # ID: But then , I think the idea of one person entering it and the rest discussing it , that isn't that bad idea , actually . # ID: Not that your opinion isn't valued , but still . # PM: well , just about , # UI: When are we going to produce it ? # PM: , the costs are within the budget . # ME: Celebration . # PM: , the project is evaluated . # PM: But , before we going to celebrate , I have a little question which you can't answer , because there must be some kind of end report . # PM: I am busy with the end report right now . # PM: You might thinking what the hell was he doing # ME: What is an end report ? # PM: about all the meetings , what we have decided , a r a report of this day . # PM: , that must be made , but I don't know , here is standing whoa , we can celebrate now , but the end report is # ME: Oh , you ha you have ten minutes left , I read . # ME: You have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report . # PM: Okay well , that can be done . # PM: Maybe we can do it together . # PM: You can see what I've So I s I will put it on a story-board . # PM: You can see it . # PM: Because I think it will it must be # ME: You you already made a beta version , or # PM: , it's a three with seventy five , just about . # ID: Y yikes . Seventy five pages . # PM: Well , just a moment . # ME: Do you want a chair maybe ? # PM: you can s you can read it and here it is . End report . # ID: So you finished it actually , and so we just have to read it and say yes or no ? # PM: Well , this not nit it read-only . # PM: But it's not fully finished yet . # ME: Five minutes for finishing . # PM: , this is about the functional design , the things yeah . # ME: Management Expert , you have to change that . # PM: when I said it , I remember I had it here . # UI: It's a read-only version . # ME: but you can save it u the under another name . # PM: Marketing Expert , about the three functions where which are most used and which must immediately be visible on our remote control . # PM: , it must be simple to use , very clear what to do , and at the younger people . # PM: So , this is really about wh what kind things must be in it and # PM: , I understand you , I can talk a little bit Dutch . # ME: No , you have to put , switch channels at the top , because that's the most used function and teletext at the second # PM: Oka okay , okay , I really didn't knew that . # ME: a volume changing , second . # PM: So , this one's first . # PM: You go there and you go there . # PM: Well , maybe I can then do it one two three . # ME: Yes , very good . # UI: One two three . # PM: If the order is in is important , that's the word for . # PM: then the conceptual design . # PM: , well all the things we have discussed , the energy , which turn out to be batteries , so that's # UI: Well , okay , maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost . # PM: , he here it is still double-curve , the rubber , the flashy , the fruity , the removable . # ME: Single-curves . # ID: It's not double . # UI: A single-curved . # ID: , it's not double anymore , eh ? # PM: Not double anymore . # PM: Nay but that this is what # ME: Was initial , the plan . The initial plan . # PM: And the added functions like Tetris snake , it's under the parental control , the touch-screen . # PM: So , it's just a summary of what we had discussed # ID: On thing One small thing , the added functions . , was it included in the cost ? # ID: I don't think so , eh ? # UI: , it's very cheap . # PM: it's very cheap , # ID: It's very cheap . # PM: you maybe you come at # ME: No , it's not very cheap , but that # PM: It's very necessary . # ME: no , but it's a development inside corporation . # ME: Like , w we don't have to buy parental control . # ME: Our own people can make that , I think . # PM: , but it still has some # ME: , it has some cost , but # PM: but so we can discuss that # UI: He'll do it in his free time . So # PM: we can discuss that kind of things I think with the with the board of # UI: Of directur or directors . # PM: What's it what's the company called ? # PM: I just keep forgetting it . # ME: Real Reaction . # PM: Real Reaction . # PM: Real Reaction , . # UI: You can ask your personal # PM: Okay , so anybody misses something here about # UI: , the end conclusion . # PM: that's what I'm gonna write b between now . # ME: Okay . Still the end conclusion . That's all , I think . # PM: But , i in here nothing # UI: , the decision to make the buttons on the top , and the menu on the on the bottom . # UI: And clearly , touch-screen you've mentioned . # PM: , touch-screen I've mentioned . # ME: , but the decisions are put in the conclusion , I think . # ME: Why we decided to use a flat L_C_D_ . # PM: well I gonna redesign something now . # PM: Because I think it will Oh , five minutes from to finish meeting . # UI: Oh , before you change anything maybe you save it first . # UI: You can't you can select file and export and then those J_ PEG files . # ME: , but then you had the same thing . # UI: Well , eight . And we have , another blank one . # ME: Example of children remote . # UI: Did we change anything ? # UI: It's a new commercial logo . # UI: Don't save it , aye ? # PM: Oh , that's cool , Tim . # PM: Finish meeting now . # UI: why are only the first five SMARTboard files # PM: I'm going to finish my end report . # ID: Okay , hereby is the meeting is finished . # PM: I am the one who can say that . ? # PM: Hereby the meeting is finished .
