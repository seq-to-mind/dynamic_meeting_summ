# PM: well this is the kick-off meeting for our project . # PM: this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes . # PM: so first of all , just to kind of make sure that we all know each other , I'm Laura and I'm the project manager . # PM: Do you want to introduce yourself again ? # ID: Hi , I'm David and I'm supposed to be an industrial designer . # ME: And I'm Andrew and I'm our marketing # UI: I'm Craig and I'm User Interface . # PM: so we're designing a new remote control and Oh I have to record who's here actually . # PM: So that's David , Andrew and Craig , isn't it ? # PM: And you all arrived on time . # PM: so des design a new remote control . # PM: , as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly . # PM: so that's kind of our brief , as it were . # PM: and so there are three different stages to the design . # PM: I'm not really sure what you guys have already received in your emails . # PM: What did you get ? # ID: , I just got the project announcement about what the project is . # ID: Designing a remote control . # ID: That's about it , didn't get anything else . # PM: Is that what everybody got ? # ID: Did you get the same thing ? # PM: So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it . # PM: And repeat that process three times . # PM: and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there . # PM: So you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . # PM: So who would like to go first ? # ME: I will go . That's fine . # ME: Alright . So This one here , right ? # ME: Okay . Very nice . # ME: My favourite animal is like A beagle . # ME: charac favourite characteristics of it ? Is that right ? # ME: , right , well basically high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family . # ME: And , that they have lots of personality and be fit and in robust good health . # ME: So this is blue . # ME: My family's beagle . # UI: Well , my favourite animal would be a monkey . # UI: Then they're small cute and furry , and when planet of the apes becomes real , I'm gonna be up there with them . # ID: There's too much gear . # PM: You can take as long over this as you like , because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss . # PM: we do we do Don't feel like you're in a rush , anyway . # ME: I coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles . # ME: Boy , let me tell you . # PM: We might have to get you up again then . # PM: I don't know what mine is . # PM: I'm gonna have to think on the spot now . # ME: Impressionist . # PM: Is that a whale ? # ID: , well anyway , I don't know , it's just the first animal I can think off the top of my head . # ID: Yes . Big reason is 'cause I'm allergic to most animals . # ID: Allergic to animal fur , so fish was a natural choice . # ID: and I kind of like whales . # ID: They come in and go eat everything in sight . # ID: And they're quite harmless and mild and interesting . # PM: God , I still don't know what I'm gonna write about . # ME: Superb sketch , by the way . # ID: Tail's a bit big , I think . # PM: I was gonna choose a dog as well . # PM: But I'll just draw a different kind of dog . # PM: M my favourite animal is my own dog at home . # PM: That doesn't really look like him , actually . # PM: He looks more like a pig , actually . # ME: I see a dog in there . # PM: Oh that's very good of you . # ME: Now I see a rooster . # ME: What kind is it ? # PM: he's a mixture of various things . # PM: and what do I like about him , That's just to suggest that his tail wags . # PM: he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , and very kind of affectionate and he's quite wee as well so you know he can doesn't take up too much space . # PM: and And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well , which is quite amusing , so # ME: Is he aware that th it's his own cha tail he's chasing ? # PM: It is . I think it is . # PM: He only does it after he's had his dinner and he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room . # ID: It's an after dinner dog then . # ME: Probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned . # PM: Right , where did you find this ? # PM: Just down here ? . # PM: what are we doing next ? . # PM: Okay , we now need to discuss the project finance . # PM: so according to the brief we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro , and we're aiming to make fifty million Euro . # PM: so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . # PM: And we don't want it to cost any more than twelve fifty Euros , so fifty percent of the selling price . # ME: , can we just go over that again ? # ME: , so bas at twel Alright , . Okay . # ME: So cost like production cost is twelve fifty , # PM: All together . # ME: but selling price is that wholesale or retail ? # ME: Like on the shelf . # PM: I imagine That's a good question . # ME: Our sale our sale anyway . # PM: I imagine it probably is our sale actually # PM: because it's probably up to the retailer to sell it for whatever price they want . # PM: But I don't know , # PM: I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ? # PM: Think it will ? # ME: Well right away I'm wondering if there's th , like with D_V_D_ players , if there are zones . # PM: regions and stuff , . # ME: f frequencies or something as well as characters , different keypad styles and s symbols . # PM: Well for a remote control , do you think that will be I suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is . # ID: It does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons . # ME: And then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price . # ME: I'm thinking the price might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so # PM: What , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ? # ME: Just a chara just a characteristic of the # PM: Like how much money people have to spend on things like ? # ME: Or just like , basic product podi positioning , the twenty five Euro remote control might be a big hit in London , might not be such a big hit in Greece , who knows , # PM: Aye , I see what you mean , . # ME: something like that , . # PM: Good marketing thoughts . # PM: Oh gosh , I should be writing all this down . # ME: Right away I'm making some kind of assumptions about what information we're given here , thinking , 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic , something other than just standard . # ME: so I'm wondering right away , is selling twenty five Euros , is that sort of the thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or # PM: Like how much does , you know , a remote control cost . # PM: Well twenty five Euro , I mean that's about like eighteen pounds or something , isn't it ? # PM: is it as much as that ? # PM: Sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds . # PM: , I dunno , I've never bought a remote control , so I don't know how good a remote control that would get you . # PM: But , I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky . # PM: Let me just scoot on ahead here . # PM: well d Does anybody have anything to add to the finance issue at all ? # ME: Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other # PM: That would be useful , though , wouldn't it , if you knew like what your money would get you now . # ME: , interesting thing about discussing production of a remote control for me is that l as you point out , I just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits . # ME: It's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something . # PM: Five minutes to end of meeting . # ME: It just comes along . # PM: We're a bit behind . # ME: Do you know what I mean ? # ME: Like so sort of like how do you I mean one way of looking at it would be , well the people producing television sets , maybe they have to buy remote controls . # ME: Or another way is maybe people who have T_V_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something . # UI: My parents went out and bought remote controls because they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house . # UI: So for them it was just how many devices control . # ME: Okay so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses # PM: Right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know , # PM: do your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything ? # ME: Well like , maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm pilots . # ME: They're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras , M_P_ three players , telephones , everything , agenda . # ME: So , like , I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market , such as the lighting in your house , or # PM: Or even like , you know , notes about what you wanna watch . # PM: Like you might put in there oh I want to watch such and such and look a Oh that's a good idea . # PM: So extra functionalities . # ME: Like , p personally for me , at home I've combined the audio video of my television set and my D_V_D_ player and my C_D_ player . # ME: So they w all work actually function together but I have different remote controls for each of them . # ME: So it's sort of ironic that then they're in there you know , the sound and everything it's just one system . # ME: But each one's got its own little # PM: we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes . # PM: I'll just check we've nothing else so anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used , what they would really like to be part of this new one at all ? # ID: And you keep losing them . # PM: You keep losing them . # ID: Finding them is really a pain , you know . # ID: I mean it's usually quite small , or when you want it right , it slipped behind the couch or it's kicked under the table . # PM: W You get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep . # ME: That's just really good id # PM: I mean is that something we'd want to include , do you think ? # ME: I remember when the first remote control my family had was on a cable . # ME: Actually had a cable between it and the T_V_ and big like buttons that sort of like , like on a blender or something . # ME: And , you know , when I think about what they are now , it's better , but actually it's still kind of , I dunno , like a massive junky thing on the table . # PM: Still feels quite primitive . # ME: Maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . S # PM: Maybe like a touch screen or something ? # ME: Something like that , . # ME: Or whatever would be technologically reasonable . # PM: Well I guess that's up to our industrial designer . # ME: 'Cause it could b it could it could be that f it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better , but that just the appeal of not having # PM: It looks better . # ME: You know , these days there's a r pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic , you know . # ME: , nicer materials and might be worth exploring anyway . # PM: Right , well so just to wrap up the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . # PM: So that's about ten to twelve by my watch . # PM: so inbetween now and then , as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it so y you know what you're doing there . # PM: for user interface , technical functions , I guess that's you know like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do . # PM: and marketing executive , you'll be just thinking about what it actually what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , I guess . # PM: , so it's th the functional design stage is next , I guess . # PM: and that's the end of the meeting . # PM: So I got that little message a lot sooner than I thought I would , so # ME: Before we wrap up , just to make sure we're all on the same page here , We were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something , are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? # ME: Or are we keeping sort of like a design commitment to television features ? # PM: well just very quickly # PM: 'cause this we're supposed to finish now . # PM: I guess that's up to us , I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it , so , you know # ID: I think one factor would be production cost . # ID: Because there's a cap there , so depends on how much you can cram into that price . # ID: I think that that's the main factor . # PM: Right , okay , we'll that's the end of the meeting , then . # PM: thank you all for coming .
# PM: Is that alright now ? # PM: Okay , everybody all set to start the meeting ? # PM: Okay , we've got half an hour for this one to discuss the functional design . # ME: Could you plug me in ? # PM: All ready to go ? # PM: so hopefully you've all been working away , and I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . # PM: so I guess just to recap on what we did last time . # PM: kind of got to know each other a little bit and got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss a bit about the project , you know , cost-wise how much how much money we had to s just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , which is the The first one is that the company's decided that teletext is outdated because of how popular the internet is . # PM: Nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . # PM: they've also suggested that we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ or anything else . # PM: I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect how long it takes us to get it into production , the time to market . # PM: So , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ . # PM: And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . # PM: I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is . # PM: It might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere . # ME: And the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ? # PM: Well that's the thing , I'm not sure th because on the company website , what does it say something # ME: 'Bout putting the fashion in electronics . # PM: I mean do they Is that something they want actually written on it , 'cause it's quite long . # PM: or , just the idea , but I'm not sure . # PM: So that's something we can discuss as well . # PM: So those are the three things , just not to worry about teletext , only control the T_V_ , and incorporate the colour and slogan of the company . # PM: so is everybody okay with any of that , or do you want me to recap at all ? # ID: Nope , we're all set . # PM: time for presentations then . # PM: Who would like to go first ? # UI: Alright , can I st steal this from the back of your laptop ? # UI: so this is the technical functions design . # UI: to do the design I have I've had a look online , I've had a look at the homepage , which has given us some insp inspiration from previous products . # UI: I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer and I would like to ask you guys for your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting . # UI: unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room , so , having a look at the existing products , I found out that it tends to come in sort of two extremes , there's either a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you don't know what you're doing . # UI: in that case the labelling tends to be very bad . # UI: there's an example I'll show you at the end , sh show you now . # UI: here the button there and there . # UI: This one's prog . # UI: That one's perg and that one's prog , and it doesn't really tell you what it does . # UI: , not sure if you had a look at the other control in that example . # UI: it's a very simple one . # UI: It's got only the basic functions mm but it's the same size as the hard to use one . # UI: it looked a bit clunky . # UI: They're very big and not very much use for buttons . # UI: and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions . # UI: There's there's nothing for instance for a slow motion button . # UI: , my own preferences , I prefer the clunky one . # UI: it's very easy to use . # UI: but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which I quite like having on the controls . # UI: so I believe the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , or something like tha from the bottom of it . # UI: So , now I'd like to ask for your preferences . # UI: not sure of how long we've got , # PM: Well we can chat away for five minutes or so I think at most . # PM: Just a couple of minutes anyway . # ME: M , like a lot of a lot of what I've read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what Craig's just gone over . # ME: So in part I could I could give you some of my personal preferences but I could also th add some to this which is just about sort of sort of market research . # PM: Shall we sh well we'll stick to kind of your area for now . # ME: we might come to that later . # ID: Which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. . # UI: , the clunky one is the one on the right . # ME: clunky in what sense , like h heavier ? Larger ? # UI: I think it's supposed to be the same size , but it's got much fewer buttons . # UI: It's , you know , it's very spread out # ME: I see , so it's more just basic . # PM: Looks kind of . # UI: and kind of you know # UI: , I get the idea it'd be sort of about this size . # UI: got very few buttons on it and # PM: Well I think it's a valid point . # PM: I mean like the one on the left looks quite complicated , and that P_R_T_ p P_R_O_T_ thing is incredibly confusing . # PM: so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design , but you don't want to lose out on , you know , what it does , so maybe you know you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open , I think that's a good idea . # PM: I think it's a good idea . # UI: , do we have any functions that we'd want on it ? # UI: I mean so far I've got on and off , switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . # UI: they're just the very basics you could use for a T_V_ . # PM: and then actual numbers for channels as well , . # UI: , you say that's a h a required one or a requested one ? # UI: Would you like # ME: Which was that ? # UI: the channels like the numbers on thing , # ME: Up the numbers , or the up down ? # PM: God , I wou I would say that's required , I mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels , I mean would anybody disagree with that ? # PM: what else , So don't need to worry about teletext , don't need to worry about V_C_R_ , any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about , # PM: you know like brightness and contrast ? # ME: Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising . # ME: We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? # ME: Is that right ? # ME: Is that what we're doing ? # ME: We're kind of like sorting them an Or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have ? # PM: I think are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice ? # UI: , to start with sort of a bit both , we need to find out exactly what we have to have and after that we can add things if they're possible . # PM: Well , do you wanna maybe just , at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a p as a function of this . # PM: , so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and # UI: There's on and off , volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . # ME: Well , one way I would look at this would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . # ME: and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . # ME: For example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . # ME: Maybe they're un they're in a little area but covered up , things like channel and volume are used all the time , so we just have them right out on top , very just very sort of self-explanatory . # ME: so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . # ME: And others that are also available and then others that are concealed . # ME: Something like that . # PM: well , just to wrap up quickly on this little section Have I just lost , do you think maybe that's the only kind of essential requirements , and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , maybe like a mute button , that sort of thing . # PM: Any of you anything to add to that at all ? # ID: I'll add it later , I guess the presentation . # PM: if we can move on to next presentation then please . # UI: Do you want to switch places ? # ME: Can this can this pl reach ? # ME: Can this plug come across ? # PM: Probably not , actually . # ME: So why don't I just pick up and move then . # ME: Here , I'll just Why don't I just # UI: Just just switch them . # ME: Mm er , can you go up behind me ? # ME: Kinda This is so This # PM: bit complicated . # PM: It'd be nice if everything was wireless , wouldn't it ? # ME: I'm all in a knot now . # ME: So I can I can say already , I dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of kind of redundancy in the in the issues and the things . # PM: Oh , like overlap between what you said ? # PM: Oh well , for all you know that that'll happen . # ME: Which is ma not necessarily a bad thing , but may what I've already started doing is cr I created a slide in my presentation here so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and mine , because certainly I have a hard time separating things completely . # PM: Mm hard to know what where your role ends , . # ME: Obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what like market research mm that I've been So how do I how do I get this up ? # ID: function F_ eight . # PM: pr , press function and F_ eight , . # ME: Alright . So F_ eight ? # ID: Function , the blue button . Next to the control on the left . # ME: Oh , and F_ eight . Okay . # ID: You have to push it together . # ME: Okay , I think that that's doing it now . # ID: Try that again . # UI: Think maybe the wire in the back might be loose . # PM: , you wanna Oh oh here we go . # ID: Yep , there we go . # ME: Before I bring this up what I'll just say is what I've what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to you guys so that it's now becomes a collective thing . # ME: And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding , 'kay what are our options , what should we decide and do you know what I mean , so . # ID: Increase that 'cause we can't see the That's much better . # ME: Okay . Alright . # ME: That would be So does that make sense ? # ME: So what I basically got is I just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how we could review it and how we could and what kind of decisions we could take away from it and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities . # ME: 'Cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through . # ME: So I'm thinking here about primarily about customer needs , that we start with the customer , and w you know , what they want and what are issues with existing products . # ME: to think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics . # ME: and then , as I say w we'd like to prioritise our design features from this # ID: Bouncing on top . # ME: So this is what I've found here , a lot of this is new to me , so we'll just read through together . # ME: , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . # ME: So they find them ugly . # ME: Most people find them ugly . # ME: the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition . # ME: Okay I'm gonna we'll look at that in a second . # ME: most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . # ME: So I guess what we're looking at here is people want this h technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them . # ME: So I think what we're doing is we're trying to take like if for me this is sorta like three different inspirations , you know , one is that we want something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . # ME: And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands . # ME: frustrations . # ME: They get lost a lot , s as it came up in our last meeting . # ME: , takes time to learn how to use them . # ME: This is why I mention when Craig was showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , so d it doesn't just look like a big panel , kinda like when you look at , you know , a new computer keyboard , or something that is quite explanatory . # ME: If you want audio , if you want visual , then you have those . # ME: and I will admit I don't know what R_S_I_ stands for . # PM: Repetitive strain injury . # ID: Is installing a new remote control something that people # ME: , no , that did not come up at all . # ME: so here is another sort of a review here of the main things . # ME: I also found that most people would adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . # ME: Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . # ME: So I dunno if that's possible we might consider getting into it . # ME: And and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this , I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy . # ME: people additionally aren't liking the appearance of their products , so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can put that into a unit which is which people like . # ME: You know , they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics . # PM: So want something that looks good and is easy to use , big priorities . # ME: so you know just c looking at what Craig Craig's i ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and separate the different things that we wanna include in this . # ME: So if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology . # ME: You know , it's like I find a lot of T_V_s these days , something really like about 'em is if you wanna just turn 'em on and off you can , but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through . # PM: So it you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know . # PM: I think it's a good idea . # ME: That's s that's sort of the But I I'm my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it . # ME: I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles , and then use that . # ME: But not let that confine us technologically . # ME: Any comments on all of that ? # PM: Well , one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be who's our target audience , our target market . # PM: , so if we want something that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ? # ME: Where's the money , maybe . # PM: , who wou who would have the money to spend . # PM: Well i if like twenty five Euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine , # ME: And who watches T_V_ . # PM: well I don't I'm not really sure how much that will retail at . # PM: But you want it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , I suppose , they're gonna actually go out and buy one . # PM: So , who do you think we're aiming this at ? # ID: , I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . # ID: 'Cause twenty five Euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ? # PM: It's about sixteen , seventeen pounds , I think . # ID: Is that too is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ? # ID: so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up-ish . # ID: You know how much ? # ID: I dunno I guess you pay , what , ten quid for a remote ? # ID: Like a simple replacement , right . # ID: I mean if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get , would you how much would you pay ? # ME: This this kinda touches on your comments there , David . # ME: These are the age groups which we have information on and these are this is a table of h what people would pay more for a certain feature . # ME: Just gives us a rough idea of where the w the will to spend money on T_V_ equipment is . # ME: Mostly focused around the twenty five age group . # PM: so do you think we're aiming at a fairly young market then ? # ME: Sort of young professional , kind of . # PM: do you think then voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ? # PM: What what do you think , Craig ? # UI: Well , did you not say it was the adults that were going for the voice recognition ? # UI: Sort of the older group . # ME: , it's the It does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying , in terms of # PM: I think we are gonna have to narrow it down , to say let's target these people and give them what they want and 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it . # PM: So anybody anything there to add Just kind of young professionals , th like if we are going to include speech recognition , it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . # PM: So we could say that was our target . # ID: I think twenty five to thirty five is fair to add that in as a group as well because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology . # PM: Okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young . # PM: You know , they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing . # ID: I think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer , who are familiar with their with computers in their everyday work . # ID: I think people who are maybe about I wouldn't say thirty five , but people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that . # ID: So these are people who are gadgety , right ? # ID: People who are u growing up used to , you know in schools and in universities , when you go on to their working lives , people who would you know regular # PM: So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech . # PM: That that's a good point . # PM: okay , so shall we make the decision to include speech recognition # ID: I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now , # ID: because , based on what you've go y everybody's saying , right , you want something simple . # ID: You want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use . # ID: Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use . # ME: Could it be an on off thing ? # ME: Like if you want it on # ID: but what I'm saying is that we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology , # PM: Where you can activate it and deactivate it ? # ID: rather than focusing on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . # ID: So maybe we should I suggest that we think about speech recognition , anyway it's a it's something that can be used to fulfil a function , but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first . # PM: well do you wanna give us your presentation # PM: and then we can I don't know might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , but this is this is how we're # ME: , it's good well it's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind . # PM: Oh it's something that's just occurred to me as well is if we make it speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people maybe with a physical disability as well . # ME: And not losing . # ME: And also it helps in terms of people not losing this , you know they they're saying oh it's I lose it in the couch . # ME: like we're kind of what we're b sort of getting in into here is mating different design features together that they # UI: I reckon one problem with speech recognition is I've actually seen one of them used and the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours . # ME: Oh really , you've seen one before . # PM: Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ? # UI: I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in . # ID: do you mind passing me my notepad . # PM: Mm . Course not . # ID: Well this is just the working design . # ID: Well this is just what how I would go about it . # ID: I guess I try to define like what we're doing now , try to define what we're trying to get done . # ID: I think in a practical way , we kind of know what it is . # ID: We've used it , we're familiar with it , but we're we can't n we haven't narrowed down exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like Besides the basics , I think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are . # ID: Has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target . # ID: are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ? # ID: and I just the idea is just to get everybody to I usually have a have a design that's there as a basic , so , you know , things that to start everything going . # ID: But I guess everybody does have some idea , so I don't think there's a need for that . # ID: okay this finding things is a little bit confusing , so I'll go into the diagram first . # ID: It just explains how the process goes through , from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need in the diagram and in this slide probably works better . # ID: you need some power source . # ID: 'Kay , a battery or something , to keep it going . # ID: and that power source is important because it ties you down to how long the device will last . # ID: it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want . # ID: Like for example , voice recognition , right . # ID: That might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , you might need to power other things , so that's one perhaps constraint there . # ID: Th Okay , the basic thing is there's a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever . # ID: You know , and that picks up an input from a user , a logic a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and the device has to r you know , based on you push button A_ , so I will do something with button A_ . # ID: So maybe button A_ is the power button , okay . # ID: and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here . # ID: and I think that's about it in terms of my design . # ID: It's fairly general , and I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in the way you're thinking , like voice recognition , right , if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power . # ID: So it's not really a constraint in that sense , but I mean these are functionally , you know , the base , what the technology has to do . # ID: so I guess the rest of it I think we should maybe you wanna go back to what the functions are ? # ID: I think that's more relevant to a discussion ? # PM: Well , do you wan do you wanna finish up your whole presentation then ? # PM: Are you are you all done ? # ID: Ps Oh , it's just putting the rest of it into words , but it's essentially the same thing . # ID: you have a transmitter , an input device , logic chip , you know , stuff like that . # ME: And like on the means b # ID: I guess this would be # ME: Since we're on the topic of the technology , are there any like what are our options ? # ME: Alright , what's what i in Is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin # ID: , these aren't technology options in that sense . # ID: This is just a basic principles and basic components that are needed . # ME: The basic principle of # ID: For example , if you needed if you needed to add a voice recognition , right , then your user interface would be split , broken down into more components , right , which you have a microphone , the V_R_ and stuff like that . # PM: Oh . So this just show how we're kind of modularising the whole thing . # ID: So each component represents one function , but I think the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , and the receiver , okay , and the power are things that you won't have to care about . # ID: and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it . # ID: there might be one other consideration which would be that the transmission between the remote control and the T_V_ for example . # ID: Okay , are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ? # ID: Because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to . Right . # PM: Well well a worry that was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect how long how long it took us to get this to market , so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about how we transmit it because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red , so we could stay with tha # ID: There might be one other problem with the transmission , in particular right now , since we're talking about voice recognition . # ID: if somebody's gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them . # ID: you may not require that , but you know , it's something very natural , I guess , you know , to hold it , to signal to the user , and push a button maybe to start s talking about it . # ID: Then you need to send the signal out , so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight say the T_V_'s at that chair , and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it . # ID: So in that sense , there's not really a restriction but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process . # ID: Not so much further down . # ME: And just a clarification before we finish this . # ME: does c is our controller is it have the option of being on a standard frequency as all of the other equipment , so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment ? # ID: There's there's not much specific information , but I think that one indication of infra-red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices . # ID: Because infra-red is something which everybody has . # PM: W Well well we've In the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the T_V_ , # ME: Just to T_V_ , okay . # PM: so that's what we should do for now I think . # PM: Something I was wondering about was the power . # PM: , is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ? # PM: I mean is that something we really want to go into , do you think , # ID: There's a there's # PM: or should we just consider running on regular batteries ? # ID: Okay , from a from a component point of view there's added complexity , and you add cost to it , and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component . # ID: You need a docking cradle , for example , for you to put it in to charge . # ID: Or you need to get the user to plug it in . # ID: and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller . # ID: But unless the controller's gonna consume a lot of batteries , like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month , then I don't think rechargeable is something we should you know , we really need to care about . # PM: Okay , so just stick to regular So basically the I'm just gonna just recap what I said at the start , was that the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at , and what exactly the product's gonna do . # PM: So just to recap on Are we all happy about the idea of aiming the product at the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? # PM: and also the funct the actual functions of what it's gonna do . # PM: Do you wanna recap on that , Craig ? # UI: I think we just say that it was gonna be the most basic stuff possible . # UI: on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and skip to a channel . # ME: And is it going to include any of the more advanced features , or are we gonna eliminate those ? # UI: I think we include mute , but apart from that I think we just we'll go for the simpleness . # ME: R is it is it is it s is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some # PM: , it's as optional functions . # ME: 'Cause what I'm I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , you know , w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that . # ME: I dunno if that'd be a problem . # ID: Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? # ID: maybe I could suggest we break them down into three simple categories . # ID: One would be audio controls , one would be video controls , and the other one would be a device . # ID: this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially , but I think that from a manufacturer's point of view , from a person designing the device , but I think from a point of view of a person using the device , you know a T_V_ is something they see and something they hear , it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . # ID: I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic . # ID: I mean it might help with the visualisation . # ME: 'Kay , okay . Like that . # ID: And it would actually help with the component build as well . # ME: Mm okay , great . # PM: , okay well I gotta kind of got five minutes to wrap up now . # PM: next thing we're doing is having lunch . # PM: and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage . # PM: so I'll be putting the minutes of this meeting into the project documents folder . # PM: so I guess just to just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway , for our Industrial Designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept . # PM: User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface , and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching . # PM: and you'll all get specific instructions as well . # PM: So I dunno , just to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking . # PM: , do you wanna start with David . # PM: Anything else to say at all ? # ID: Mm no , not really . # ME: just I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up , shall we agree for sake of sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed , where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything we discuss about them is sort of , okay , we're talking about this . # PM: , I think that's definitely a good idea . # ME: Shall we do that , then ? # UI: just about the three buckets , what would go in the device functions one ? # ID: things like on off . # ID: Because they don't have anything to do with what you see . # ID: I me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value , you know , so # ME: And and channel . # ID: Because the on off also goes , you know , like on off like power , not on off sound . # ID: Not on off video . # ID: Although you don't turn off the video on your T_V_ , but you might wanna you know turn off the sound , say you wanna pick up the phone , there's a mute button , right , so you have you have a choice of putting it on to others or a device . # ID: Device is basically anything which we can't categorise , right . # PM: so you're gonna have audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume hi # ID: anything to do with what you hear , right . # ID: You you put that into audio . # ID: And then video is anything that you can see . # PM: and then visual Okay , so brightness , contrast , things like that , and then just actual device things , # PM: like what channel you're watching , turning on an off , stuff like that . # ME: And then k I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are maybe a bit more # ID: Like random which we have no other place to put , but we need it somewhere there . # ME: Sure , okay . Okay . # ID: even if it doesn't map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind . # ID: It's easy to use , I think that's one thing that and I guess from the component point of view it's easy to build as well 'cause things are like fixed . # PM: so , I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good , because of who we're , you know , targeting this at . # PM: something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe . # PM: Make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold , you know , things like that . # PM: so I guess I guess that's it . # PM: That's the meeting over . # ME: Then we get to go find out what was picked up for lunch for us .
# ID: 'S to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is , so in that sense so it does kind of make sense , . # ME: It kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background . # ME: Everything I have is kinda background . # PM: Okay we all ready to go ? # PM: Well how on the in this meeting then if we I'll just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . # PM: And we decided on decided on our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into those categories , . # PM: And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the T_V_ , and trying to incorporate the corporate colour and slogan . # PM: so that was the last meeting . # PM: Is there anything have I forgotten anything ? # PM: Is that everything ? # PM: so if we have the three presentations , and then if you have anything to kind of that you know you're gonna want to discuss , maybe just make a note of it , and we'll have all the discussion at the end . # PM: That might be a better idea this time . # PM: And so if we start off with Andrew and then Craig and then David , if that's alright . # PM: and then after that we'll have to make some decisions about stuff , right . # PM: So if you wanna take this . # ME: Why don't I get that ? # PM: Screwed in quite tightly . # PM: what did how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? # PM: We did we say we were gonna try maybe incorporate it but we hadn't made a definite decision on that ? # PM: Oh I should also point out that the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product . # PM: So that's kind of the end result hopefully . # ME: alright so c is it function F_ eight ? # PM: Hopefully appear in a wee second . # ME: I think it's working . # PM: Up there we go . # ME: Okay great s so let me just start this . # ME: Uh-huh oh where'd it all go ? # ME: Okay lemme just see where I can find it . # ME: This looks more like it . # ME: I think I just opened up the template . # ME: Sorry about that . # ME: Okay alright so let's have a look here . # ME: Okay so this was the method that I've taken . # ME: basically what I wanna do here , before we get into it too far , is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful . # ME: And and then sorta g go through some of the way that I've dealt with that information , and then sort of bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision . # ME: so I've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify trends that are sort of in sync and are important to our p project plan that we have so far , and then initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to narrow in on aspects that will inform other elements of the of the project . # ME: Does that make sense , tha that sort of strategy ? # ME: I thought that will impact on the rest of what we do , so that's why I suggested we get in this . # PM: Aye a fair point definitely . # ME: Okay so out of different figures and ratings ob of people in general , consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay , and not , it specified , not a functional look or feel , b f fancy . # ME: however , this is where we kinda have to be very , I think , creative about it . # ME: Number two was that it be innovative . # ME: Okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary sort of functional bits to it . # ME: and third priority for ease of use , so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be , quite user friendly while still having technology . # ME: So it I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing , is that I think what we should think about is how the about how the innovation contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it . # ME: For example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something , you know what I mean , like , or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative because obviously the thing that the message here is ease of use . # ME: So how do you make innovation make something more easy to use ? # ME: Well that's I guess where we're gonna go with this . # ME: Okay then there's the other aspect of the back the market research I have here is on fashion style , okay , which as we've agreed is a priority . # ME: top European fashion trend that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay , especially in clothes and furniture . # ME: And when I first saw that I thought , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get right into it , or we completely steer away from it , # ME: do you know what I mean ? # ME: So my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics . # ME: 'cause I think what we're in what we're in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer , so I think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something , I think that would be pushing it . # ME: And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of , you might say ergonomic or friendly to handle , which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case . # ME: So probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode , so if we try and really capitalise on that , I think that'll be in our favour . # ME: So these this is the summary of everything . # ME: style is number one thing in the in the market of who we're selling to . # ME: innovative design technology's also a must in that it's seen it'd be seen to be cutting edge , but ease of use t has to be insured throughout . # ME: That was like the number three thing . # ME: And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours that's the way I interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so I've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , Mac iPods , something which is , I'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons . # PM: Mm that's true , . # ME: You know what a Mac iPod is ? # ME: I'm thinking however Mac iPod is sort of last year's because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy , so I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of or more of like a maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have . # ME: and then so this is w with all that information what I'm what I'm suggesting in this slide here is that we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more techni like sort of production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout . # ME: Sort of like a I dunno like we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , sorta like a marketing identity . # ME: Does that make sense ? # ME: So so like I threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , I dunno , green colours , pe whatever , it's just an idea , 'cause I'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that . # ME: Like the ones the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like lemon or something like that , you know something which is , like you see a lot in other areas . # ME: Like I see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and So anyway it's just an idea . # ME: I'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like something to do with like lighting within it . # ME: Like you know just within the simple sense , when you pick up a phone and touch a button it lights up , q usually the buttons light up . # ME: How can we build on that ? # ME: Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like covers or something so . # ME: Anyway those are that's all I have , # ME: but hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into # PM: thank you for that . # PM: Craig do you wanna plug yours in then ? # UI: Is it working ? # ME: Did you press F_ eight ? # ID: It's probably not sending . # PM: Oh something coming now , . # ID: Yep , there it is . # UI: And so think of this concept . # UI: to research it I've had a look on the homepage again . # UI: It's provided me with more examples of previously existing c remote controls . # UI: there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , so I've taken the suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this So then this we're looking for suggestions on size th size of control and the buttons , the shape of the control , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control . # UI: what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them . # UI: they're not very attractive to look at , and they're not very comfortable to hold , they're I just hold 'em like big bricks , and they're very easily lost . # UI: they tend to be very dark colours , so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them . # UI: the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme . # UI: for instance , the stand-by button isn't always red , it really should be . # UI: It's something the user then identify with . # UI: This is a red switch off , that's how it should be . # UI: I'm not sure if there's any other examples of that , but something to look out for . # UI: there's a problem that I've got couple of preferences for the end control I get 'em with the red colour button for stand-by and s the other examples of that The buttons should be large . # UI: They shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones . # UI: They should be easy to press , very comfortable . # UI: one of the examples given on the homepage was there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a V_ on them , so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that's kinda confusing . # UI: should avoid s things like that . # UI: if the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere . # UI: obviously trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could tie-in very easily with your lime and lemon idea . # ME: do we have a corporate colour scheme ? # PM: I think it's yellow # PM: because like the website is yellow and there's a band at the bottom is yellow , # ID: And the Play-Doh 's yellow . # PM: so yellow , lemon , you know definitely food for thought there , # PM: but keep going and we'll discuss it after . # UI: any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden , they shouldn't be on the shouldn't be visible without something be opened or some sort of special extra effort . # UI: if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be a button as alternative , possibly hidden in the opened up section making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice , maybe they got a cold or we should definitely avoid the big square block look . # UI: That's just wrong . # UI: And we got an email from I think it's the research department , and they've said th the voice control can now talk back if you ask it a question . # UI: So it sh it could be good to have them confirm any action you take # PM: Aye that's a good idea , . # UI: and possibility . # UI: Right and these are problems I've had with it . # UI: I don't know where the slogan should go , or really what the slogan is . # UI: I think it's , fashion into electronics . # UI: And we don't know how flexible the colour scheme is . # UI: I mean you say you wanted the corporate colours , but they don't say you know if we can use any other colours at all or That's it . # ME: Lots of good information there . # PM: that was very good , and now with David . # UI: I think I'm cool . # ME: It's a shame the cable wasn't just in the middle of the table , # PM: I know it'd be handy , wouldn't it . # PM: Do y do you wanna sit in the line of sight of this # ID: Let me just get this going first . # ME: It takes a second , doesn't it ? # ID: 'Kay , that should be it . # ID: Okay I guess the same thing again , I started with something very basic . # ID: So just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process , and then you can just work through it and we 'll either modify it or start from scratch depending on what your needs are . # ID: the components are exactly the same . # ID: I think , like what you guys said , the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface . # ID: The rest of the components they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity . # ID: like you said time to market was a problem , and how many components are physically in there in cost . # ID: And the power is basically a factor of that . # ID: and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , they affect you in terms of the size of your device , and that would have some inte impact on how y I think more how you hold rather than the actual use using the remote control because like we've said we've defined , like we only want the basic things that to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide . # ID: So you know it's just a matter of working out space . # ID: So I guess three things , cost , complexity , and the size . # ID: These are the three things that will have an impact on you . # ID: So just go through it in the components . # ID: these are the options that are available to you , I'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are . # ID: it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen . # ID: I it said something about a sensor but never clarified that . # ID: So maybe if you well I could see the other email that they sent you , 'cause they got back to me with like different requirements , or different offerings of what components availa Okay so your basic components are buttons , okay and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel , okay there's an L_C_D_ display , I think these are quite standard things . # ME: They're standard , aren't they ? # ID: they're well in the sense that these are all the options available for you . # ID: I'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later . # ID: Okay then there's how the case actually looks . # ID: It can actually be flat or it can be curved , and then the different types of materials that you can use , I don't think you can use them in a combination , I could check back for you , but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination . # PM: We you couldn't have like plastic and rubber ? # ID: I think plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , I wasn't I'm not very sure about the titanium . # ID: They had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium . # ID: the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use , but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing , so I think that there is some restriction on I think you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium , but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one . # ID: You know as opposed to two . # ID: and the other components are logic chips , again I'll go back to the component chips . # ID: The com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit and that impacts cost . # ID: I don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size . # ID: Power consumption should be about the same . # ID: I think the main impact is complexity , and the other thing is the power options . # ID: the first one is a standard battery . # ID: Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing , it's a wind-up you know , a crank . # PM: I'll clear one of these things for you . # PM: Just by moving it . # ID: but that might be something I think that's more of a look and feel decision because I don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources . # ID: I think whatever it is you still need a battery 'cause I don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing . # ID: Okay the other ones are a solar powered cell , which may not be a great idea in Europe or any country that has seasons 'cause half the year you'd be dead . # ID: So like what I said , you probably need like a battery and something else . # ID: and the kinetic one I guess for me is the most interesting one because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their and it's a nice sales gimmick I think . # ID: From a marketing gimmick it it's a technology thing , it's a shake it doesn't work , shake it , knock it or something . # ID: You know you know you have you had those balls , you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes , # ID: you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber . # ID: You know just to if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it , kind of you know just you know so . okay # PM: I know what you mean . # ID: my from my role , I don't think that personal preferences but role preferences , I think something comfortable to hold , small and slim I guess that's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't , you know like a phone or something , too small phone . # ID: and the other thing is from a production point of view the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit . # ID: and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it so . # ID: okay let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions . # ID: The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard okay , the L_C_D_ panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic . # ID: the case okay with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels . # ID: Okay with the titanium case , let me just check that , titanium case can't be curved , it has to be square . # ID: Okay there's no restriction on the plastic , and # ME: It can't be curved . # ID: it can't be curved on the wood . # ID: So that's again , I don't think you can use them in a combination , especially the titanium I suspect they're very fixed to a particular need . # ID: So mixing them may not be a good idea yep . That's it . # ME: question on can I ask a question ? # PM: it's just I'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so but you c ask away . # ME: Can we power a light in this ? # ME: Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ? # ID: I think we could because the L_C_D_ panel requires power , and the L_C_D_ is a form of a light so that # ME: So maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery . # PM: Why what kind of light do you want are you thinking of ? # ME: I mean I'm thinking it might be That for this to be a high-tech thing it's gonna have to have something high-tech about it and that's gonna take battery power , and to make that to make that a realistic goal I think one of the issues that will come up later is , can the battery power it ? # ID: Are you thinking are you thinking of a light in the sense of a light , or a light in the sense of it glows kind of you know Frankenstein , it's alive . # ME: Illuminate the buttons . # ME: Well m I'm thinking along the lines of you're in the dark watching a D_V_D_ and you find the thing in the dark and you go like this , and that's what everybody does . Oh where's the volume button in the dark , and y you just touch it , or you just pick it up , and it lights up or something . # PM: Like a phone , like the backlight in a phone . # ME: Like a phone , yeah . # ME: Whereas with phones , people charge them once a week . # ME: We're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days . # ID: that's why I think the option of the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch , like an automatic watch # ME: But are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ? # ID: it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it . # ID: So you could trigger that to a light , like I said the bouncing ball thing , or you could trigger that to use that to power the light as opposed to so when they pick it up , right , and then that sorta triggers the glowingness . # PM: let's just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start , and just giving an id idea on the time , we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most . # PM: So so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an decision on the concepts of the product . # PM: So back to your idea about incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg , and the corporate colour , and things like that . # PM: I mean what does everybody think about Does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together ? # PM: I mean that's kind of the user interface type of thing , what are your thoughts on that ? # UI: I think we could go for like maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape . # UI: you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit . # PM: So maybe do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you th you'd hold onto comfortably or # UI: probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably , sort of feels right in your hand . # PM: So something quite curvy ? # PM: Colour-wise I mean you made a re was it you or I can't remember who made the point about how if you've a nice bright colour you'll not lose it , was that # ID: I think he made that . # PM: about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much . # PM: and when the corporate colour is yellow , I mean maybe we could think about the colour of the whole product being yellow I don't know . # PM: And then obviously the materials when it has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what might work ? # ME: Well I mean I'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts , and if we think that what we are w our number one marketing motive is the look and feel . # ME: So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of concept and technology or whatever or fashion , then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize . # ME: maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the colour , you said company colour yellow . # ME: I mean if we think of something , like I was saying also lime and lemon you know , what can we come up with something where we try and associate it with like the series . # ME: We just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the shapes and things . # ID: Is there a particular shape that you're interested in ? # ID: Like does marketing have any research on does it need to be long ? # ID: Does it need with a square thing wha # PM: Oh you know like in circular in shape or # ID: 'cause that will n help narrow down the choice of # PM: Choice of material . # ID: I'm thinking fruits in my head , but that's tacky . # PM: 'Cause I was kinda thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels it feels kind of warmer to the touch . # PM: It feels a bit more comfortable , and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber into it . # PM: And then we could have curved shapes , 'cause wood or titanium , it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and I think we might be moving away from that you know so Well I'm do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or # ME: No no not at all . # PM: no I don't think we do either . # ME: It's more just that we think about like what it is we're trying to achieve , so and then we have one sorta theme that we stick with . # PM: Okay right well # ME: Do you know what I mean ? # PM: so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing . # UI: I'd quite like a sort of snowman type shape . # PM: A snowman shape ? # UI: so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need . # PM: That's quite a distinctive shape , that would be good wouldn't it . # PM: so should we go with that ? # ME: can we like to and wha like do you have a # PM: Do you wanna draw it on the board ? # ME: Can you like just t we can visualize it . # UI: something like that you got two groups there maybe it could fold up and you get a third group inside # PM: Ooh that'd be good . # UI: or you have volume controls about there . # PM: So call it the snowman-shape trademark . # PM: and I mean colour-wise what does everybody think ? # PM: I think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere . # PM: I mean do you want the whole thing yellow , maybe like yellow and white do you want something # UI: So I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had this here , had a sorta background yellow , and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons . # PM: and also I mean how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? # PM: The fact that it talks to you , I mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics or something , I dunno . # PM: Or when you like or if you turn it off or something if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere . # UI: I think that might scare me . # PM: I d I d any thoughts on that at all ? # UI: I think that'd probably scare me . # UI: You turn it on your control possessed s . # PM: unless an a I mean if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate an L_C_D_ display , where would we put that ? # PM: Would we put that on the inside or # ID: Do we need an L_C_D_ display ? # ID: What what's the functionality of that ? # PM: It's bound to increase the cost of it a lot , I would've thought . # ID: but the question is what are we using it # ME: What would it achieve ? # ID: what would we what would we achieve from it ? # ID: Putting in lights is cheap but putting in an L_C_D_ panel just to make it glow is a bit of a # ME: L_C_ well I'd when you used to mention the L_C_D_ I'd think I wonder what that would be about . # ME: And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with listings . # ME: So as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is . # ID: I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it , # ID: so it's a bit nuts to get the Monday Tuesday Wednesday you know . # PM: Mm oh that's true . # PM: So so no need for an L_C_D_ display ? # ID: I I'm not saying there's no need for an L_C_D_ display , but it's what's what would it tell the user , # PM: I think that would make it very complex . # ID: 'cause the L_C_D_ tends to be an output as opposed to an input so does the remote control need to talk back to the user ? # ID: We have the option of the speaker as well the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there a need for the remote control to talk back ? # PM: I don't know if there is really , I would say no need for a talk-back . # PM: does anybody disagree with that ? # ID: You could put a game on it . # ID: When the T_V_ dies you can play with the remote control . # PM: Okay right so you're gonna have the three different sets of functionalities , I mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , is that what you're thinking ? # UI: well I think the advanced ones the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside . # UI: B I think the we had were fairly basic ones , they'd have to go on the front somewhere . # PM: what else do you need to talk about ? # ME: Well i I was just # ID: Where would you physically position the buttons ? # ID: I think that has some impact on many things . # ID: maybe you wanna draw onto the # PM: So I'm just gonna pop this in here 'cause I have a slide about decision making which I'd forgotten about . # PM: Oh sh God we've got five minutes back we go . # PM: energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing ? # PM: I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have kinetic power , I mean what does anybody think about that ? # ME: I've had kinetic things before , and the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it , # ID: like I said we have a h hybrid kind of thing , so it's not gonna charge the battery , it's just # ME: and watches right , okay . # ME: Support for it . # ME: I mean just it's just worth pointing out because like I've known I've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time , and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery . # ME: I've also known people to have things like a jewellery watch they wear from time to time , and they eventually just say it's just too much of a nuisance because I don't wear it all the time . # ME: Like remote control is similar , you're away on vacation , I dunno whatever , you something , and it just starts to get worn down . # PM: Well I suppose that if you're if you're away and you're not using it , then you're not using any power either . # ME: So we should think about # PM: So you'd have the battery as the kind of to keep it ticking over idea I'm really sorry we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , we don't have as much time as I thought . # PM: so I think that's what energy is referring to here . # PM: Chip on print , is that that's an industrial design thing , is it David ? # PM: Okay as for the case , kind of discussed that # ME: And this size here , I'd suggest this be small , like quite small . # PM: I know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel kind of # ME: just a lot of the I mean one of the things running through my mind right now , I realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made , but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there . # ME: Should we think about how we are actually getting this high-tech user friendly theme like what is it that we're u we're using to achieve those goals ? # PM: Could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that . # ME: Okay so backlighting , that would be good . # ID: Or even a clear case . # ID: you know a glowing a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable , # PM: Aye that would be a good idea . # ID: but in the dark it sort of , it's alive . # ID: in a slight subtle way . # PM: S so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it . # ME: that'd be really good . # ID: Or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse . # PM: Is that what you mean ? # ID: You know you have cordless mice and they don't eat that much power right . # ID: So the power the battery in that sense , maybe you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights that sort of # ME: they emanate a light through it . # ID: but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , doesn't make it freaky . # ME: and then the other thing that we we're s we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , and so I'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like some kind of an innovative concept about how the volume and the channels are controlled , 'cause that's the main thing people will f wanna do . # ME: Could we use like a jog dial , like a nice just sort of round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ? # ID: The question is when you're rolling it , how do you wanna roll it ? # ID: Do you want 'em to roll it like that ? # ID: Do you want 'em to roll it like that ? # ID: 'Cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it , whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally . # PM: if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that , couldn't you ? # ME: Well why don't we do it like a mouse then ? # PM: If you're holding it in your hand you could # ID: That's a very unnatural motion to # ID: Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot . # ID: it might work for volume , and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that , but not for channels right . # ID: If you have a Telewest box you've got like , you don't have to buy all the channels , you've about fifty channels , can you imagine trying to . # ID: and I don't think having that you know too quick too slow kin it's confusing to the # UI: Well , but then for skipping a large amount of channels you do have to skip the channel button , the number part . # ID: But users tend to tend to want to use that and once they lose out on the user experience they're like Because that's becomes the most accessible thing in front of # ME: But that's not a bad thing is it ? # ME: Because when you think about it , the alternative is to go push the button . # ME: Jog dials are much easier than that . # PM: right well wouldn't it # ME: You just roll . # PM: we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in nice and quickly . # PM: I'm all for them actually , I think they're quite you know th very quick to m to use . # PM: So does anybody oppose the idea of incorporating one into the design at all ? # PM: And the other thing was can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ? # ME: like I mean if we if we keep coming back to this board here , I wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea , imagine that , I dunno , that it's within the shape of the hand , it's quite small # PM: ooh okay , we really gotta wrap up # ME: It's small , and that we've got like the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side , # PM: well if we can do that , great . # ME: and that well I mean isn't that what we just h said we s just have to decide now ? # PM: let's try and get the slogan on there # ID: So you wanna expand the shape of the # ME: And then like a jo And then like a jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like I dunno like here , in with the # ID: That that might have one problem in terms of in terms of whether you're left handed or you're right handed you might be locking yourself in . # ME: It would get bumped , it's doesn't really fit with your hand . # ME: Or maybe just fit it in like down the middle here . # ID: Could I just could I just jump in and suggest something quickly ? # PM: Right I'm gonna have to # PM: I'm really gonna have to hurry you on here 'cause we're actually over time . # PM: is there anything anybody's unsure about ? # PM: Just for in closing just the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes , and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing , I know that the designers are gonna be working with Play-doh on that . # PM: that'll be that'll be good . # PM: and I'll get the minutes up as soon as possible . # PM: Anything at all you think we haven't discussed that we need to ? # PM: Is everybody kind of happy about what they're gonna be doing ? # ID: I think one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite a big impact on the thing # ME: I think the jog dial , you know it just after you drew that , what if it was flat and you just spun it , # ID: that's what I was thinking the # ME: that'd be great . # ID: a slide , because then you don't have to put the hand . # ID: I think incorporating a logo is quite straight forward . # ID: There's lots of space for it # PM: That's kind of a design thing that you guys can discuss , . # ID: but it's also a marketing and a function # ME: and materials we sorta said we'd do plastic and rubber , didn't we , and I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , 'cause that'd just be so standard . # PM: To make something flush with the case ? # ME: Something a bit more flush , # ME: or maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well , so that it has and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand . # PM: Sp kinda grippy ? # ID: Feel like fruit . # ME: They feel kind of like , you get pens now and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're not , # ME: they're actually just plastic that's textured , # ID: kinda like that . # ME: kind of a little bit like # PM: I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to call this to a close 'cause we're way over time . # PM: So that's really good , like we've s had much to talk about that pretty much run out of time to do so . # PM: So off you go and design stuff # ID: Play-doh time . # PM: quite jealous actually . # ID: You got to choose first . # ID: No , we're kidding . # ID: can I just swipe your power cable , I don't think it matters . # ID: Okay lemme okay , I'm gonna pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left . # ID: This is a real hassle and a I'm gonna take the microphones , 'cause it's too lazy t take them off again .
# PM: Okay we all set ? # PM: Well this is the final detailed design meeting . # PM: we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . # PM: And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , and then I'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report . # PM: just from last time to recap , we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display , no need for talk-back , it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery with rubber buttons , maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing , hopefully a jog-dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well . # PM: Anything I've missed ? # PM: if you want to present your prototype go ahead . # ID: Ninja Homer , made in Japan . # UI: , there are a few changes we've made . # UI: , well look at the expense sheet , and it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside , so instead we've this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen , just a very basic one , very small with access to the menu through the scroll wheel and confirm button . # UI: , apart from that , it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time . # ID: And there isn't d it doesn't open up to the advanced functions ? # ID: the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that they're not in use . # ME: Where are they ? # ID: they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial ? # PM: So w what kind of thing is gonna be # ID: The L_C_D_ panel just displays functionally what you're doing . # ID: If you're using an advanced function right , like c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say You know it's like it only has four columns , it's a very simple L_C_D_ like , whereas many the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast . # ID: It might even be one , a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the symbols of the various functions . # PM: Oh right okay . # ME: and what is this here ? # ID: That's a number pad . # ME: Okay so the number pad is 'Kay , great . # PM: Where are we gonna have the slogan ? # ID: they're al along this # UI: You know , just like right inside there . # ID: You have this space here , and then you have this thing on the side as well , or at the bottom . # ID: 'Cause slogans are usually quite small , right , they're not like huge so they're s Say a button's about # ID: say a button's about this size , right , so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan , say even for that . # PM: So if this isn't to scale , what kind of dimensions are you thinking about here ? # UI: Well we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand . # ID: so that would be about a centimetre for a button , so one two three four centimetres . # ID: Plus maybe half o five six seven eight , # ME: About nine in total . # PM: Six , seven , eight , nine , ten . # ID: about nine total . # PM: So we're talking about ten centimetres . # ME: That sounds good . # PM: That would be good . # PM: So ten centimetres in height . # ME: That'd be good , in fact a pen is about ten centimetres usually , so that would be that sounds like a really good size , if you see it there . # PM: That's great and it's very bright as well . # ME: Is it possible I'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours . # ME: Is these are these the colours that of production , or is this just what we had available ? # UI: Well I'm We're gonna have again the sort of the foggy yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button . # PM: Okay so just could you just list all the things that it does s so I can write them in the report . # UI: this button , because it's red it's sort of very prominent , we're gonna use it as it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal . # UI: apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen and you use this as a jog-dial . # PM: so that's like an okay button , right . # ID: Oh we've discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ? # ME: How high is it ? # ID: No as in the height , but what about the width ? # UI: Didn't put five centimetres . # PM: like depth of the actual thing . # ID: Do we need five ? # ID: I don't think five is be about th three and a half . # PM: Oh is this k to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there okay . # UI: Something by there . # PM: So you can power on and off , what else can you do ? # ME: Three and a half . # UI: you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons . # UI: , were gonna have the volume control here , but because we've got the L_C_D_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd use that as the volume . # PM: Okay jog-dial for volume . # PM: And what else do you do with the jog-dial ? # UI: you can use it for more advanced functions like contrast , colour and # PM: Contrast , brightness , and anything else ? # UI: just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions , we didn't actually go through and specify the # PM: Well of the designers what are they ? # UI: what can a T_V_ do ? # ID: Okay things like brightness , contrast , maybe tuning the channels . # PM: Okay channel tuning . # PM: That's a good one . # ID: the various inputs . # ID: Are you having a V_C_R_ , are you having you know which input do you have ? # PM: auxiliary inputs . # ME: probably colour or sharpness . # ID: colour , sharpness . # ID: a lot of these things will have to be free and open for users to define them . # PM: Okay what about sound settings ? d can you change any of those at all ? # ID: Audio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid-range , your high range . # ID: left-right balance , maybe even pre-programmed sound modes , like the user could determine like a series of sound modes , and then what could happen would be when you click on that then it would go to that setting . # PM: is there anything else at all it can do ? # PM: 'cause that's fine . # PM: Just need to know so I can write it down . # PM: Okay right I g I guess that's it , so we can now We can now have a little look at the Excel sheet and price listing , and see if we need to if we need to rethink anything at all . # PM: for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ? # PM: Do we have kinetic as well ? # PM: just battery . # PM: And that's because of cost restraints is it ? # ID: advanced chip . # PM: what about the electronics here ? # ID: We need an advanced chip I think , yep . # PM: Advanced chip . # ID: Let me just confirm that . # ID: Yes I think so . # PM: the case , what does it mean by single and double , do you know ? # UI: I think single would just be sort of one sort of oval whereas double is this sort of thing . # PM: So we want double-curved ? # PM: Is there any rubber at all in the buttons or any # ID: I think we're gonna have to skip the rubber . # PM: and we wanted special colours didn't we ? # PM: So I'll have to put that Oh no wait we ho how many colours have we got there ? # ID: For the case itself , one colour . It's one special colour . # PM: Just one colour , okay . # ID: 'Cause the case unit itself , the rest of our components go on top of it . # PM: so interface-wise , is it this third option we have , the two of them there ? # ID: One and the L_C_ display . # PM: and then buttons , we have what , two colours ? # UI: we have got some push buttons as well . # ME: Or even clear . # ID: We've got push buttons as well . # PM: Like oh wait so push button and integrated scroll wheel push # UI: So I reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber . # UI: I'm not sure if that counts but # ID: Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one . # ID: and maybe a special colour for the buttons , so maybe four again . # UI: You can see we're all very far beyond the # PM: So w why are we arriving at the number four ? # PM: Where does the number four come from ? # ID: 'Cause that's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons . # ID: So we're just estimating that it would be less . # PM: so we're writing down four . # PM: How about these ? # PM: Are we wanting them in they're just is everything gonna be plastic ? # PM: So we're w quite far over . # PM: Now we're gonna something's gonna have to go . # PM: we're at sixteen point eight and # ME: how are we going to achieve this high-end product if # PM: Well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three Euro , # ME: We only have very sparse # PM: let me see , what are we # ME: Two point three ? # ME: Four point three # PM: four point three . # PM: My maths is all out . # UI: Well we could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits . # ID: How much would that save us ? # ME: And then where is the # PM: How much would that save us ? # ID: That will only save you one . # ID: The other thing could be that you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together , because when you do something on the T_V_ , the T_V_ responds and reacts as well , so the user could be looking at the T_V_ and pushing his thing so we may not need to # UI: That's fair enough , . # ID: when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond , which I think is a technically doable thing so # PM: Okay so So w what's our reviewed suggestion ? # PM: take away the L_C_ display ? # ID: And the advanced chip goes away as well . # PM: To be replaced with a # ID: Regular chip . # PM: regular chip . # ID: So what that means is that # PM: And so we've got point three to get rid of . # PM: and we ha where are the four the four push buttons are where exactly now ? # ID: The twelve buttons that you see there . # PM: Twelve buttons . # UI: That's one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so # ID: Functionally you're gonna have to intercept So four is a good estimate for # ID: so you can't actually cut It's like three times the number of buttons , four , eight , twelve . # PM: Like is that one big button or is it twelve buttons , # ID: It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is a single panel . # PM: how can it be something in between ? # PM: well we have point three to get rid of somewhere . # ID: We just report that it has to be over budget , or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons . # ME: we could just go with # ID: Normal coloured buttons . # PM: Well do you want colour differentiation here ? # ID: No that's not the button we're talking about . # PM: Oh sorry then . # ID: the buttons only refer to the pad so Should we take that off ? # ID: Hey it's back to the original . # ID: so then these just become normal coloured buttons , so that might be some way of cutting the cost . # PM: ach that's a shame . # PM: so take away that completely ? # PM: And now we're under budget . # PM: So we do have point five Euro to play with if we wanted . # ME: How about with embossing the logo , isn't that going to cost us some money ? # PM: Doesn't say so . # ME: That's a freebie . # UI: Reckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons . # PM: that's a good idea . # PM: Does that mean that one button has a special form or # UI: I think there's just one button so # PM: Well well there we go . # PM: So I'm just gonna have to redraw this now . # PM: So we're not gonna have the L_C_D_ anymore , and we'll just gonna have an on t on the T_V_ it'll show you what you're doing , which I think is fair enough , and so this is gonna be one big thing here . # ME: Was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible ? # ID: What do you mean by profile ? # ME: Sort of flat as possible . # UI: You see I envision it as being quite deep sort of deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat . # ME: that's what I was thinking , to # ID: We didn't have enough Play-Doh to make it three D_ . # ME: alright fair enough . # ME: Okay , just thought I'd ask . # ID: So there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to add , and you might want to add in the report , length , width , and height . # PM: So just to well to be thorough then , width-wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something ? # PM: and then so height-wise How how tall do you envisage it being ? # PM: About that big ? # PM: About two centimetres , okay . # ME: Two's not very high at all though . # ID: This is about this is about two . # ME: Maybe a bit higher ? # ID: Slightly more than two , so # UI: See , about that thick . # ME: Maybe closer to three even or two and a half . # PM: Okay we'll s we'll say two point five . # PM: so we have it within cost anyway . # PM: project evaluation is this point . # PM: Okay so can we close that ? # PM: This is what it's the final spec that it's gonna be . # PM: Someone is gonna have to that's fine that's fine . # ME: it's probably just I dunno if it's worth getting into , but just in that we want this to be stylish , should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid , because I've seen there's lots of devices out there that instead of taking your standard nine square grid , and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that # ID: I think that's something that's very hard to catch , so you restrict the number of people who wanna try something . # ID: The the look and the colour is something which is cool , # ID: but I think that there's also that factor of if it's too unfamiliar # ID: then because when you put it on the shelf # ME: What about button shape ? # ME: Square buttons ? # ID: button shape might be a good idea to change , rather than rather than positioning , 'cause I think positioning is we're kinda engrained into the telephone kind of # PM: So at this point we , let me see , discuss how satisfied we all are with these four points , with the room for creativity in the project , and leadership and teamwork , and the stuff we had around us I guess . # ME: Do you want me to d Do you want me to do my design evaluation last ? # ID: Maybe we should do the design evaluation first . # PM: I wasn't really sure what that was # PM: , go for that first . # PM: I wasn't entirely sure what who was supposed to be doing that , but y you go for it . # ME: , alright so the way this works , I'm gonna need to plug into PowerPoint , I'll try and do it as quick as possible . # ME: , this is I'll just go over your head if that's okay . # ID: I don't think you need the power , # ID: No , that's okay that's okay . # ME: I don't need the PowerPoint ? # ID: No , the power cord itself . # ID: so then you have a bit more freedom to # ME: Let me get that . # ID: You you still have your blue fingers . # ME: so what this is a set-up for us to use a kind of a like a # ID: You killed a monster . # ME: The idea is that I've set up I've reviewed all of the points of discussion from the beginning , and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the for the current design th or the plan , and so we can review that . # ME: I think it's gonna end up being sort of elementary because we're sort we're in n we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but Doesn't seem like it's going , does it ? # PM: Oh there it is . # ME: and I'm gonna write up our results on the board , so this'll be a way for us to go through and decide if we're sort of review where we stand with it . # ME: Okay , so So to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had , when we rate this , one is v high in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low , So these i these i th are the and we've been asked to collectively rate this , so what we can do is try and just y work on a consensus system so we just come to an agreement . # ME: So the first one , stylish look and feel . # ID: I rate that pretty highly . # PM: I mean compared to most remote controls you see that's pretty good . # PM: I dunno like a six or something . # PM: What does anybody else think ? # ME: me my only reservation with it was that we basically went with yellow because it's the company's colour , and I don't know if yellow's gonna really be a hit . # UI: I'm seeing five then . # ME: What do you guys think ? # PM: I would say five or six . # ID: Yep I'm fine with that . # ME: Okay let's go with five then . # ME: Fi oh just actually the opposite . # ID: It's one to seven , right ? # ME: So it meant three , # PM: , then I would say two or three . # ID: what's the scale , one to seven , right ? # UI: One's high-ish isn't it ? # UI: so , two or three . # ID: it's upside-down . # ME: Let's go with two point five then . # ME: control high tech innovation . # PM: Well it has the wee jog-dial # ME: We had to remove so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted , but jog-dial # PM: I'd go with three or four , # ID: but going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing . # PM: about three , okay . # ME: Style reflects a fruit inspired colour , design . # ME: I shouldn't have said colour , but just # ID: Okay , the blue the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour , # PM: Well that's kind of # ID: except for the b the red button , they because for want of a # PM: But the yellow , I mean it could be a lemon yellow colour , # ME: Right . , could be . # ID: the yellow is more representative of the colour , # ID: but the button itself , the blue can be anything else . # ME: so we'll go two . # ME: and design is simple to use , simple in features . # PM: I mean it's really basic looking isn't it ? # ME: F f fairly basic , # PM: I mean I'd give that nearly a one . # ME: you guys think ? # ID: Yep , that's fine . # ME: , soft and spongy , have we achieved that ? # ME: We've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price . # UI: I think it's about five . # PM: That's really low . # UI: well we have to use plastic # PM: I suppose mm 'kay . # UI: so it's probably gonna be # ID: company logo . # ME: could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it ? # ME: Was that an option ? # ID: I think it'll be cost prohibitive , # UI: I think I'd probably increase the cost . # ME: It would cost more than plastic . # UI: We've only got like what , ten cents left so # ME: logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ? # PM: Gonna have that on the side , aren't we , like there or something ? # ME: And it's within budget , yep . # ME: so we can say then that out of a possible or what would be our goal here ? # PM: Out of forty nine , I guess . # ME: out of forty nine with zero being the highest . # ME: We are at two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five . # PM: 'S pretty good . # ME: So it's pretty good . # ME: Translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal . # ME: I think 'cause if you turn that into a hundred it would be about # ME: about thirty one , # PM: about thirty one . # ME: and then invert that , it's # PM: So ab well about sixty nine , seventy percent . # ME: Oh right , about seventy , seventy percent . # PM: It's pretty good . # ME: That was just a little formality for us to go through . # ME: hundred pound pen . # PM: Nobody saw it , honestly . # ID: The cameras did . # PM: Is that you all have all finished , or # ME: I did have one other one other frame I thought , I mean I d not knowing how we would deal with this information , I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals . # ME: It's not something I need to p push through , but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions , sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat Could our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the , I don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant , I dunno the Whatever just some theme and then we have different tones , lime green , lemon . # ME: It's just discussion . # ME: I mean obviously we can just abandon this , it's fine . # ME: I'm just thinking about what we originally set out to do . # ME: so there . That's all . # PM: Okay , great are you submitting the evaluation criteria or am I ? # PM: I don't know what your instructions have been . # ME: , I think to record it and I haven't been asked to submit it yet . # PM: just wondering if I need to include it in the minutes , because if you're submitting it anyway then Okay great . # ID: It keeps getting too big . # PM: well next up then , because we've done finance , is the project evaluation . # ID: 'Kay I'm listening I'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the thing , so I'm playing with the Play-Doh as well . # PM: Oh right , okay . # ID: Just in case you're wondering , why is he still playing with the Play-Doh ? # ID: Just about right L_E_G_O_ Lego . # PM: well do you wanna just individually say what you think about these four points and or not those four points , my four points , forgotten that . # PM: You got a different # ME: I like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that . # PM: Oh , they're good aren't they , . # ME: It's really quick . # PM: Right okay , here we are . # PM: as a note we'll do this alphabetically . # PM: do you wanna start Andrew ? # ME: so what is it you're asking of me now ? # PM: I don't know , just your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them . # ME: Or sort of our work on setting this up . # ME: Well , is it okay I'll just go through your system then . # ME: The the room is fairly institutional , but the main thing is , I think our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to have l sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion , you know , as in other words this room is sort of a centre point of creativity , whereas in reality as we've gone through this , it's not really the centre point of creativity , it's more just a # PM: Well d do you feel though that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ? # ME: d debating but that's just the thing is the quest in terms of the first point there , the room , it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know . # PM: But I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room . # PM: I think it means like you know # ME: oh right , oh right okay room for creativ Oh right I just looked up and saw okay whiteboard , digital pens , the room . # PM: Well I dunno do you th I think it means I think it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so # ME: I th okay on th dif answering the question in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of okay fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme , but then i then we're told okay use the co company colours . # ME: So what do we do . # ME: We're told okay think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds , so actually the creativity was more of like a f sort of a f formality then an actual # ID: You feel like you're caged within whatever y # ME: within the constraints # ID: It's like a balloon in a cage , it can only go so big and not hit the side . # ID: The constraints do come in very fast . # PM: Okay do you know what , actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it , I think . # PM: So still on the topic of room for creativity next up is Craig . # UI: I agree with his point it's it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money . # ID: I think another point is that the meetings are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , so time is also a very s strong factor , and structure . # ID: Because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to allows ideas to get tossed , to be evaluated , and to be reviewed , and to get feedback and come back . # ID: And I guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that , I think that's a very big thing , and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts I feel it 'cause I wear m my glasses , right , and that but that irritates me right it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate . # ME: New creativity . # ID: I feel like I'm hiding behind the equipment , rather than the equipment is helping me , and you know . # PM: So you think a more relaxed atmosphere would be more kind of conducive to creative thought or # ID: Not not so much an atmosphere , the atmosphere is very relaxed , but the gear # PM: but actual environment ? # ID: you know that creates boundaries to that and the time the time given also restricts # PM: what about leadership ? # PM: I don't know if that means like , if I did a good job or something . # PM: I don't really know . # ME: , well I mean my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction , encouragement # PM: From like your personal coach person and stuff like that , do you think maybe ? # ME: and you as well I think , just sort of acting as team leader . # ME: I think I think it's # ME: I think it's good . # ME: I mean my personal views on leadership is that effective leadership sort of gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation , but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and you know , innovative thought with . # ME: In in reality I think here the different elements of leadership such as the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within . # ME: And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the team member , so But it's not bad leadership , it's just sort of s fairly strong , you know . # ME: It turns it turns the individual into more of like a sort of a predetermined mechanism , as opposed to a sort of a free # PM: So you think maybe a little too controlling or # ME: , oh , without a doubt . # ID: I think controlling is not the right word , I think the interactions are very structured . # ME: maybe not co confining . # ID: I think structure is probably what you're saying that , each individual is structured to one particular task , and one parti rather than controlling . # ID: I don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it , but that you know process actually says you have to do it in a certain way . # ID: It doesn't tell you , you know , some ways that you might wanna be a bit more creative in terms of the process you know , not the # PM: what about teamwork ? # ME: did , you wanna comment Craig ? # UI: , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting . # UI: If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would've been a lot easier . # ID: I think you tried to use the common share folder to communicate , # ID: but it just comes back to us so slow in the email it doesn't have a , you know , a messenger will go . # PM: Did did you guys get the email I sent you ? # PM: Oh that's alright . # PM: I was wondering if that got there okay . # ME: , got the email . # PM: Okay , so to s to summarize the teamwork issue , saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting , you know just like quick questions , quick thoughts , whatever , it probably would be bit easier . # ID: I think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , I think that's the word . # ID: They don't support the team working together , you know , # PM: Oh right , okay . # ID: they're still very individual tools . # ME: I mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way I see this i is that it's the s the structure in which we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the tasks were d sort of divided , and then the work went on in isolation I don't know what you guys did while you were together , maybe that was a bit different , # ID: We had Play-Doh fun . # ME: but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay , first thing we have to do is come up with let's say a design concept , and we sit here together and do it , well that's what teamwork is . # ME: To s to say okay go off and don't talk to each other , it's actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork . # ME: not that we haven't done I think the best we could have done . # ME: I'm not dissatisfied with it . # PM: anything else to say on teamwork at all ? # ID: No , not really . # PM: what about the you know how we used the whiteboard , the digital pens , the projector , stuff like that ? # PM: did anybody think anything was like really useful , anything was pretty un f unsupportive ? # ME: I think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing I would use all the time , but it's not quite as useful as to us as it could have been , maybe just in the way that we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board you know as opposed to in like in text . # ME: , and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that . # ME: I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely you know abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and point and discuss # ME: and in a way everybody's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks , we're just we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds . # ME: It wasn't until we had this here , you know , like at one point I peeked across and looked at Craig's paper and I'm like , now I know what he's thinking 'cause I saw his book . # ME: But the b the b whiteboard could've actually been this kind of continuing # PM: So do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea ? # ME: Think could be , . # ID: I think the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard , and I think that m is also does you know hinder us and things I think . # ID: It will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the PowerPoint , or maybe the whiteboard and the PowerPoint in the same place , you know in the centre of the # ME: because the PowerPoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare , whereas I can imagine if I'd been encouraged to use Paintbrush , for example , or whatever , I would've actually used it , # ME: 'ca you know , just 'cause that's sorta how we what we were set up to use while we had our time . # ID: I think that there were too many PowerPoints in the meetings . # ID: 'Cause the plug-in and the plugging spent we spent a lot of time doing that . # ID: And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints , I don't think , you know , we needed to actually it could have , we could have gone through it verbally , # ID: especially my slides , I felt that they just you know as opposed to having to present them . # PM: What about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ? # UI: Oh they're a bit clunky . # ID: Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well , 'cause you're half way through a thought , and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump . # PM: I think at the very start of today I like wrote a whole load of stuff , didn't click note on one , then went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page , but then did click note , and so I'm quite worried that I've just written over the top of it or something , but they'll have my paper anyway and haven't done that since . # ID: But I think the pen is v is very intuitive , everybody knows how to use it , we don't have to worry . # ID: So I think the pen's good . # ID: It's about the best thing . # ME: And o on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files . # ME: It just occurred to me that they all # ID: we only needed one computer and # ME: We only actually needed one computer . # ME: If there had been a fifth , that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time . # ID: And the computer may not be conducive to a meeting because you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something , you know , it's useful but # PM: Do you think the computers just provide distraction in a meeting ? # ID: I think too many computers are just distracting . # PM: I know I like to have things written down in front of me actually , like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me I ended up you know like writing down there or something so I could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that , I don't know about anybody else . # PM: what else any wh I do I'm not really sure what they're looking for when they say new ideas found . # PM: I don't know is # UI: Is this for the project or # PM: could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today at all ? # ME: , the w main one for me is that the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other . # PM: if we just had # ME: that's kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea , well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when you're told you must now work away from your team . # PM: I dunno I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do , and you can spend a lot of time talking about The only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design , I thought there maybe another fifteen minutes would have been useful there I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room , and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c just to have like something written down , just like you know a milestone if you like rather than having meetings , but There you go . # PM: so in closing , I haven't got my five minutes to go . Thin Oh there it i Five minutes to go . # PM: are the costs within the budget , yes they are . # PM: And is the project evaluated , yes it is . # PM: So now celebrate . # ID: And we have Ninja Homer . # PM: Well apparently now I write the final report . # PM: What are you guys doing now ? # UI: Do we know what the other ones are ? # PM: That is lovely . # UI: I said Ninja Homer . # ME: What did you call it ? # ID: See it looks like Homer Simpson # ID: but it's electronic so it's made in Japan . # PM: So is that j is that just is that just a logo or does it do anything ? # ID: it's just a logo . # PM: Just a logo and then like Ninja Homer , # ID: The the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna print on the side of it . # PM: I think it's quite nice . # ME: Fashion technology or something . # ID: You can wear Homer , you can throw Homer when you're frustrated , doh . # PM: Oh no , that's cool , it's got I'm kind of # PM: I'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber , I think that would have been nice . # PM: maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money . # ID: Oh , I did learn something new , Play-Doh is useful . # ID: It is useful and in conceptualizing , in being creative . # ID: 'Cause like you say , it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get a sense for . # ID: Like we were playing with the Play-Doh and the ideas came with the Play-Doh rather than with everything else . # ID: You might wanna write that down . # ID: It's just , I'm just fiddling with the Play-Doh , and I'm going yeah it's kinda cool . # UI: Guess I'd forgot how good s Play-Doh smells . # PM: , it smells funny doesn't it . # ME: And some Play-Dohs are actually I think edible aren't they ? # ID: No , all Play-Doh is edible . # PM: like the stuff for # UI: I think they're all non-toxic 'cause it's aimed for like two-year-olds . # PM: I think it has to be , . # ID: It's just wheat , it's the stuff that your mom could make with preservatives and # PM: wha what are your summarising words about Play-Doh ? # ID: It's helpful to the creative process . # ID: it engages all your senses not just your sight , but your sense of feel your sense of touch . # ID: And it helps you to understand dimension as well . # ID: I think that that's very helpful because it starts to pop up , whereas on a piece of paper , on a computer , on a board , even with a three D_ graphic thing it still , it requires a lot of # UI: it's not very tangible . # ID: tangible , that's a nice word . # ID: It becomes tangible . # PM: Mm . I don't know if there's anything else we needed to discuss . # PM: That that's about it really . # PM: Just sit still I guess for a little while . # ME: Do we retreat to our , to continue our # ID: I think we could probably do it here as long as we don't collaborate . # ME: r reporting or what i # PM: I'm sure the little the little thing'll pop up any minute now . # ID: Can we turn off the microphones ? # PM: , if the meeting's over then I guess so .
# PM: , making a profit of fifty million Euros . # ID: Alright so twenty five . # PM: So , it's go gonna have to be pretty damn trendy . # ID: The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic . # PM: I was thinking that as well , I think the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're , # UI: the universal ones . # PM: So presumably that might be an idea to put into . # ID: But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features . For sure . # PM: 'cause I mean , what twenty five Euros , that's about I dunno , fifteen Pounds or so ? # PM: And that's quite a lot for a remote control . # UI: , it's about that . # UI: my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black . # UI: As you said they come with the T_V_ so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions , so maybe we could think about colour ? # UI: that might make it a bit different from the rest at least . # UI: and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick , so I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , # PM: The the keyrings , yeah . # UI: you know those things ? # UI: Because we always lose our remote control . # ME: being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market ? # ME: What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices ? # ME: What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market . # ME: So before deciding or before finalising this project , we must discuss all these things , and apart from this , it should be having a good look also , because people really li like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their C_D_ player , M_P_ three player like any electronic devices . # ME: They really want to have something good , having a good design in their hands , all this . # ID: , what do we think a # PM: we're looking for # ID: What do we think a good size would be for this ? # ID: 'Cause I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky # ID: and there's just like a hundred buttons on it , or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily . # UI: Then you lose it , . # UI: Kind of , maybe more like a P_D_A_ kind of , just hand held , # PM: For for remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty . # UI: No , I wasn't , no I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a P_D_A_ # PM: Okay well right we'll have to I'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour we should all look into a bit , oh actually , no , we'll allocate . # PM: So you do the looking around at other remote controls . # PM: , if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever , and you could look into basically how it's made I_E_ like how you make it all in one , how what sort of materials are available to you whatever . # PM: And obviously , other instructions will come from the personal coach . # PM: Which will probably just usurp what I said # UI: So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ? # PM: Shapes and colours and basically how to make it attractive . # PM: And you look at competition and design . # ID: Wait for emails ? # PM: And no doubt we'll get We'll get warnings for next meetings as well . # PM: I shall I can't imagine these are worth much . # PM: Fashion into electronic . Okay .
# PM: minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we had decided on roles for each of you , however , there are some changes that I've got from on high are a bit well w what I didn't actually realise it was that the this is for a specific television . # PM: So the all in one idea goes out the window . # PM: And they require that the actually I'll get to that at the end point number four , we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . # PM: So , presentations , were you anybody got , raring to go ? # PM: Okay . Good stuff . # PM: Oh I need to plug you in . # ID: It's a inspired design . # ME: Sh do you want me to hold it ? # PM: there we go , just screw 'em on in . # PM: Gonna have to swap them round so # ME: So , after that ? # PM: now , it was function F_ eight . # ME: f oh sorry F_ eight . # PM: That's the wee blue one . # PM: Blue one F_ eight . # PM: Should do it , good one . # ME: , me again , Rajan the Marketing Expert . # ME: , as we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out , sorry , sure . # PM: Hold on , sorry . # PM: and if you just click that it'll go ahead , one at a time . # ME: actually , sorry I have to see the other , sorry . # ME: , yes , I have to look at the market potential for this product , like consumer likings and everything , what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not ? # PM: P press F_ five to start it first . # ME: Okay . , I can , okay . # ME: then the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey . # ME: A a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things . # ME: And what we got was , we found that if you , what they th what problems they are having with different remote controls available in the market . # ME: Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . # ME: They are not so good looking . # ME: So , we have to put stress on this , we have to take care of this fact also like our design , should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers . # ME: And yes that's wi this will definitely , this can definitely put uh enhance our sales . # ME: and even the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high pay more for this good looking remote controls also . # ME: So even if the available market goes for the available even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five Euros , which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are if the re remote control we design have a good better look designs , then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls . # ME: And the second thing , some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users or in their remote controls , but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated . # ME: Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if the consumers they want to use it . # ME: Otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things . # ME: So this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also . # ME: So we have to take care of this fact also . # ME: it was function I want to go to . # PM: Oh you wanna go back ? Just escape . # ME: , escape , okay thank you . # ME: Then if we look at this slide , these are in your shared documents , you can see , # UI: So , sorry I was just gonna say , what was the question for this ? # UI: Or is are you coming on to that ? # ME: t look all the market potential , what how we should design consu our remote controls , what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit , enhance our sales . # UI: So these percentages are what ? # ME: , these are different age group persons I can open it in another way . # PM: Okay . Speech recognition . # ME: If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this point , like for speech recognition in a remote control . # ME: So we can emphasise on this point also like , because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from fifteen to thirty five , and I and I think that most of the users of the rem T_V_ are belong to this age group . # ME: So we should look # PM: We're als we we're looking at who buys it as well . # ME: We can look at that factor also , so yes . # PM: , which I think the twenty five to thirty five is usual , sort of . # PM: Fifteen to twe # ME: Yes . I think so . # ME: if we look at this data how h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market . # ME: They find that thirt thirty five percent thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control . # ME: So it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide pl spe proper manuals for its use also so as that people consumers could easily learn . # ME: They need not to have any , much technical knowledge to see to know how to operate these remote controls . # ME: So this is also a very goo major factor to loo take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales . # ME: So this is all about market potential by me . # PM: Okay , thank you . # PM: , follow on with Helen ? # UI: Yep , sure , that's cool , # ME: we have to take that out . # PM: Fun and games . # PM: Don't know if the cable's gonna be long enough . # PM: I think I just kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as well . # ME: Brian , this one also I . # ME: Thank you very much Brian . # UI: I can turn my computer quickly if that's okay . # ME: If you want me to help , . # UI: Okay , and then what do I press , F_ eight ? # ME: F_ eight . Function F_ eight . # PM: Function F_ eight . # ME: It's not coming . # ME: Function F_ eight , okay . # ME: Computer adjusting , . # UI: Okay and then how do I press the big one , to get it on to the big and I press that again to get it off as well do I ? # PM: , F_ five and escape'll bring it back and just the left button for advancing . # UI: Okay , so I'm the interface design designer , User Interface Designer sorry , I'm concerned with w what effect the apparatus should have on the user and I'm also I want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics , so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable , it's a big concern of ours . # UI: Okay , and how do I press n just the next button ? # PM: left mouse button . # UI: So I looked at existing designs and also the information that Raj gave us was very useful about what people like , what people dislike . # UI: and what people fashionable , because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main buyers of our T_V_ I think . # UI: So what they like and what they find fashionable . # UI: And ergonomics , we said , I don't know I haven't actually been able to do any of this myself , but maybe that comes up , I don't know . # PM: That can come under Arlo as well . # UI: And the findings , well the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set . # UI: That's what people want to do . # UI: , so they need to be included , but I've got some pictures here of some leading ones . # UI: I don't know how to get to them , # PM: if you if you escape then you can see your bar . # UI: do I press F_ five is it ? escape ? # UI: I haven't got my glasses on so I hope it's this one . # UI: These are two leading remote controls at the moment . # UI: You know they're grey , they've I mean this one's got loads of buttons , it's hard to tell from here what they actually do , and they don't look very exciting at all . # UI: , personally I prefer this one just because it's looks easier use , it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff , but there you go , that's what we're up against , and I think we can do much better than that . # UI: Personal preferences . # UI: well I think we need to l I think the ergonomics is quite important , # PM: , particularly if we've there was a bit in Raj's about R_S_I_ and things as well . # UI: And I thought not too edgy and like a box , more kind of hand-held more not as computery and # UI: or organic , more organic shape I think . # UI: simple designs , like the last one we just saw , not too many buttons and as Raj pointed out , only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons , so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and how nice it looks . # UI: , hand-held and portable I think is portamint is important because T_F_T_ have just released I think is it a remote control for presentations or and a big seven inch big screen , anyway , so # UI: no seven inches isn't that big but anyway so hand-held and portable and m I thought about other functions for T_V_ but as you pointed out people don't actually want that , # PM: And also the company want to keep it stuck to the T_V_ for to keep down the production time . # UI: so maybe we forget about that . # UI: It's for one T_V_ oh right okay , sure . # UI: And so the last thing I thought w which I quickly mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow-in-the-dark # UI: which does already e exist but it's not very widely used I don't think . # UI: Easy finder with the a whistle function or something , or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries . # UI: And I think that , yep , that's it . # ID: So , I noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling , and I was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ? # ID: is that a function we want in the remote ? # PM: , do you have trouble whistling ? # UI: , I haven't been able to # ID: I don't , but I know a lot of people do right . # ID: it just I mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too , right ? # PM: , I suppose that's true . # PM: Well I suppo you could y you could have the # UI: or some sort of voice # PM: you could have the basically instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just , you know , where are you ? . # ID: That's costly though . # ID: a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping , shouting , you know , and then , what would the response be ? It beeps back at you or something ? # ID: Well , let me set this up . # ID: So I plug it in , press F_ five ? # ID: Function F_ five ? # PM: Function F_ eight for the # ID: Or function F_ eight ? # UI: Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing . # ID: Okay . I think it's just to lock it in . # ID: So as the Industrial Designer my job is to take an input from you guys , so it's good you went first , # ID: and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others . # PM: Let's remember that . # ID: so Raj told us that consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products , and he also mentioned that the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour . # ID: , a lot of the buttons aren't used , he mentioned that they're not fun to use . # ID: And a novel feature which we just brought up was this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , there could be a little microphone on it , and any noise over a certain threshold it'll pick up as a distress signal from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort . # PM: But sure surely that would have to be sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you . # ID: Oh , that's true . # ID: Well maybe you could have a tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes . # PM: Sorry I didn't mean to derail you there . # ID: well tha that's for later down the road , and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , and not computery , right , so more low tech and not too many buttons . # ID: So I took these all into consideration and also I have some limitations from the boss . # ID: and practical limitations which I kinda threw out the window . # ID: And so I did a little research and unfortunately all I had to work on was our corporate archives of the great products we've made before , which include , you know , space craft , coffee makers , and bullet trains Or or a high speed train . # PM: is that what that is ? # ID: and having personally worked with all these products I have a great deal of experience with industrial design of these . # PM: Well that's cool . # PM: If you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control , . # ID: Right . So , I figured , just put 'em all together . # ID: You got a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your T_V_ , and as for the user interface problem , you know , too many buttons . Give it one button and it's a you know , for the cowboy in all of us I I'm not quite sure what the function is there but # UI: Well I like that design . # ID: it's a g I mean you could have a you know a # PM: Is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated , is it ? # ID: So I think I missed the budget thing , it was fifty million Euros ? # ID: And we gotta sell twenty five of them ? # UI: not a problem . # ME: Fifty million was prof # PM: now it's fif fifty million Euros we've gotta we've g # ID: Oh okay , so I mixed those numbers . # PM: gotta make profit , so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time . # ID: Well I guess more realistically then , we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing , cheap plastic , you know , that should be just like a tenth of the price maybe or less . # ID: An energy source which'd probably just be your regular batteries , we don't wanna have it # PM: Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ? # PM: Is that is that gonna mark up a lot ? # UI: Or a little base station or something , . # ID: , we could do that too . # ID: , I hadn't thought of that . # UI: That might cost more though , 'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide , well we provide the first batteries , but it's more , it's that's cheaper to just provide batteries . # PM: I mean if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it , # UI: A battery in it , kinda . # PM: so I don't think it'd up the price that much . # ID: the unirs the user interface the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , but since we're a cutting edge company , we of course will have alternatives like speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power behind our product . # ID: and lastly the transmission interface is , just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about . # ID: so here's you know , a great schematic that my apprentice designer gave me . # ID: as you can see the remote control have parts and those parts look like that you know it's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that . # ID: And I suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were so personal preferences , I think programmable options which just require a small amount of memory , non volatile memory , just so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting . # UI: Mm that's a good idea actually I like the programmable options . # ID: And the , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting , more technical expenditure of effort and it's also much more likely to not work if we add these bells and whistles . # ID: That's all I got . # PM: thank you very much , I'll take that back . # ID: Ooh that's tight . # PM: Right , also so a notice I got not very long before the meeting , so didn't manage to forward it on to you , let's see , I'll find it myself , # ID: Okay , I don't think we need to screw it in . # PM: We had that to dis-include teletext because it's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway . # PM: , dunno what Oracle would have to say with that but never mind . # PM: it's only for the television , which I'm presuming means it's for a specific television , and instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design . # UI: Corporate colour . # PM: , everything , all their sort of you know the corporate website and everything's yellow . # PM: And the logo the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics I don't know exactly how sort of incorpor I mean , I guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something . # PM: Okay , so , we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have . # PM: we had as listed options we had speech recognition potentially , flat screen interface , L_C_D_ interface we also want to limit the number of buttons so we'll pretty much take that one as read . # PM: We'll use the basic functions for a television . # UI: Although the danger with that is , it could look a bit cheap . # PM: Not enough buttons you mean ? # PM: So sorta strike a balance between a few and a or it looks like we're just cutting on the # UI: On the number of buttons , kind of functions and stuff . # PM: I do however have this from over my head , that they don't want teletext on it . # PM: maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that , or maybe they'll send # PM: some information about that , about what people , whether people would require teletext in a remote teletext option in a remote control . # PM: So I take it your position Arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick . # PM: so I mean a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display , interactive display . # PM: However that does sound a bit like the more complicated design that rav sorry Raj said people didn't like . # PM: Although I guess if there's a sort of If you think about standard interfaces that people use already , sort of Windows-style drop down menus or whatever , I think maybe that's a bit , going a bit far but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons , and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have it goes to a different selection of buttons , so it sorta keeps it simple . # PM: glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ? # UI: Glow in the dark material I was thinking . # UI: , so I guess that would be cheaper than a light I think . # ME: may I say something about ? # ME: actually I think it's really very important point as if we look at the market because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote , in the room . # UI: Often lost s was that , # ME: are lost and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time . # ME: But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control , like if they come and speak something at the remote control replies to something and it glows in the dark . # ME: Both these factors both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control , # ME: and this will definitely enhance our market sales , # ME: so we should take it into consideration also . # PM: speech recognition I take it I don't , I've I know of no products that use speech recognition well . # ID: They're act there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it . # ID: You could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like B_B_C_ one and it goes to that channel . # ID: it didn't work very well though because of this noise interference problem . # ID: They mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to B_B_C_ one . # PM: or a an advert an advert for B_B_C_ two on B_B_C_ one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing . # ID: Right , right , and so there was a lot of this , you'd be watching the T_V_ and then all of a sudden it'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something , but if you can work around that noise problem # UI: Well what about this might get a bit too expensive actually , but what about something that's built into the T_V_ that you can press and it'll send out a little signal you know like the ones that we can't hear or something # PM: , that's a good idea . # UI: that will activate the remote control starts to beep . # PM: So like a kind of backwards remote from the telly . # UI: If you find if y # ID: Right and then it would do just you know , subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise . # ID: What you could do then would be you have a remote controlled by the T_V_ speaker , or not a remo I'm sorry , a microphone by the T_V_ speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote , 'cause you can't expect the television manufacturers to put that feature into their T_V_s . # UI: Mm . , that's the only thing , . # ID: But , then you have like the little se separate module by the T_V_ speaker # PM: That we should just stick on , # UI: That comes with our remote control . # ID: and then the remote control would know what's being produced by the television . # PM: And that's a sort of basic R_F_ kind of frequency so it'll be cheap . # ID: that's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again . # ID: If you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you don't even need to find it . # ID: You just say you know , whatever you whatever you want the remote for , you know to change the channel or to turn the T_V_ on and off , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know , within hearing range . # ID: And you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job . # UI: That could also be built into the T_V_ though , which might make our remote control a bit obsolete . # ID: Well , hopefully we're ahead of the curve . # PM: It might do us out of a job . # PM: I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing . # PM: so I think rather than and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that , # UI: And the expense . # PM: and expense and the time . # PM: So I think if we're going to go well I mean like the thing about the there's the problem with the T_F_T_ or the L_C_D_ kind of thing is if you're also wanting the kind of organic globby sort of feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen . # PM: , but I guess not I thin we'll just we'll just pretend that's not a problem . # PM: and how are you about the glow in the dark material ? # UI: Maybe not even all of it 'cause we said colours and fashion w were important so maybe just like a little l line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour . # PM: Contrast contra well . # ID: , no th the material's cheap but it's just the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know , and then if you're , if you're sitting in the dark for too long it won't glow any more . # PM: So if it's dow it's d Or if it's down under the couch cushions which is where I usually find mine . # PM: Okay , well we can use we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially , if we're gonna have to # UI: 'cause what I thought , main # PM: if we're gonna have the logo on as well , bright yellow logo in our slogan . # PM: then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway , and we can have sort of a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness . # UI: 'Cause , that w more than finding it , that was more like you know if you're watching a film in the dark , you can still see the remote control . # PM: Alright , so n sorta if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of feedback , sort of remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then . # UI: That was more of a gimmick . # PM: it makes it fairly unnecessary then . # UI: , unnecessary . # PM: , okay so scratch that . # PM: so we've got do we want to go with the T_F_T_ idea or the is that far too expensive ? # ID: we're getting a lot of features now , I think # PM: Well I mean I think I think the sort of find the finder things I mean it's I could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself . # ID: Well , I think a consideration too is that these remotes get abused a lot , you know they get thrown around , there's a good chance the T_F_T_ screen would break or get damaged . # ID: They're pretty fragile . # UI: So is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a T_F_T_ screen ? # PM: no , I mean that was going on ravs Raj's sort of marketing research I guess . # PM: So we'll stick with sort of programmability for the buttons that we do have . # PM: So that's sort of included in your sub-module kind of stuff , you were finding out about teletext . # PM: If you could find out that # ME: Totally , it takes cheap speech recognition , she they wi # PM: I think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a expensive , # ID: Oh no it's much cheaper than the T_F_T_ , it's just a microphone and some integrated circuits . # PM: Oh right , okay . # ID: And it'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system , # PM: Is it not the circuits that cost Oh right , okay . # PM: well that kind of takes back the R_F_ the R_F_ remote sort of idea as well . # PM: Five minutes . # PM: , votes , let's vote . # PM: Who wants T_F_T_ ? # PM: Excellent , so we'll go with speech recognition , ? # PM: , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . # PM: And what else was I thinking of that I haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head , programmability . # UI: if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick . # PM: And also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan . # PM: can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they're not already in there as well . # PM: So , it just helps me summarize them . # PM: And I'll put any I'm putting anything I do in there anyway , # UI: And where is it sorry ? # PM: pro project documents . # ID: So it should be when you save # PM: A_M_I_ scenario controller . # ID: on your desktop , so it goes save as , or # ME: it is in shared documents ? # ID: And then hit that little folder up thing again . # ME: Projoct projector . # PM: Project documents , it's on your desktop as well . # ID: All the way to the top , that's up to desktop . # ID: Right and then project documents . # ME: It is not giving anything . # ME: Shared documents . # PM: And I will tr getting strings of information , I'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular , as soon as I get them now , rather than I was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting , and then the meeting turned up , so # ID: Did you get my email ? # ID: Just making sure . # UI: What I thought as well about the material is maybe not this kind of material , but maybe more like this kind of rubbery material , it's a bit more bouncy , like you said they get chucked around a lot . # UI: , a bit more durable and that can also be ergonomic and it kind of feels a bit different from all the other remote controls . # UI: The rubber rather than # PM: More sort of flesh-like than plasticky sort of . # ME: but we have to take care like But we have to take care of our children also if they means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it shouldn't be too harmful . # ME: So , whatever material we use it should be . # PM: Oh no , ethics , that's gonna cost us money . # ME: So we have to safety point of view also , we have to take care . # UI: Oh I think wi with the more organic shape of it won't be as it won't as have many sharp corners as that , so that's something good , I dunno , I mean # ID: We could go comp . # PM: smells good for children . # ID: We could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball . # ID: And it's got the thing on the inside . # ID: And there's no buttons at all , it's always on , and just yell at it , and it works . # UI: That's a good idea . # ID: And then ch children will love it . # PM: it's gonna have to be it's gonna be have a big yellow foam ball , sorry . # UI: Interesting . # ID: Oh yellow , yellow ball . Right . # UI: , d with the colour , does it have to be all yellow , do you know ? # PM: Please God no . # PM: . Well , I wouldn't th I mean , my reaction to an all-yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than horror , so I think just having it # ME: Small logo with the like a small yellow strip or y yellow with the logo in it . # PM: surrounding the logo . # UI: Having a little bit . # PM: And I'll see if I can argue with boss about putting the what was it ? # PM: We put we put fashion into Whoops , it's not working . # PM: Can't believe I've forgotten it . # PM: We put the fashion in electronics . I bet that'll catch on well . # UI: Oh , that's a good one that . # PM: Okay , any last # ID: Twelve thirty . # PM: worries , queries ? # PM: I know what you're thinking . # PM: Okay then , lunchtime , # PM: Okay , that felt a bit more like a something with order and reason to it than the last one . # PM: This is quite fun actually . # PM: I really don't # UI: Has anybody pressed okay , it vibrates . # UI: It's pretty cool . # PM: Wow you've your first page . # ID: I've been using up the pages . # PM: I was just writing really big . # UI: , got small writing . # UI: I don't wanna waste it . # PM: I've finished the meeting now . # ID: Another questionnaire . # PM: Oh , everybody needs k questionnaire .
# PM: So the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . # PM: So switching over I've just left my first two screens . # PM: mailed you the minutes of the last meeting just to save time . # PM: and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that are particularly bothering you ? # UI: Mm . No , I don't think so . # PM: Then we shall start with a presentation from Raj . # ME: Hi , me Raj , again . # ME: in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching , how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . # ME: So we have to look on this . # ME: First of all methodology . # ME: The met methodology to find out the trend was incl was done in a way We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . # ME: So what are our findings ? # ME: in our findings we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey we found that people l people do have preference for tho fancy mobi f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel good . # ME: So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls . # ME: So we should take into we should consider this factor as the most important factor , because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as the third factor . # ME: So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh in our mark means in take in designing our rem remote controls . # UI: The last one is the most important one , is it ? # ME: No the first one is the # ME: the outlook of the mobile , the it should have a fancy outlook , the fancy design rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good . # ME: The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically innovative . # ME: We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo remote controls are . # ME: So it should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that . # ME: So that indicates our technological advancement . # ME: And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , like it shouldn't be too much co complicated , there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi remote control , it shouldn't be too complicated like this way . # ME: And it should be and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . # ME: So that they could know how to use these remote controls . # ME: When we did f fashions , recent fashion our recent fashion update shows that # UI: I was just reading fruit and vegetables . # UI: Hard to know how we are going to incorporate that . # ME: we have to , because d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , because the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic , becoming more and more organic , # ID: We should make a big sponge lemon , # ID: and then it'd be it would be yellow . # UI: Th that's very good . # ME: So something like that we should do . # UI: Glow-in-the-dark . # ME: And people the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look . # UI: Well , that's good . # UI: That's what we kind of predicted anyway . # ME: So so that they could play with it while handi while handling it . # ME: So that should also be taken into consideration . # ME: So these are my views . # UI: Okay , the spongy , not real spongy , you can # UI: Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ? # ME: The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co # UI: Quite disposable . # ME: 'Cause we It shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also , because our company is very well for taking all these concerns into consideration , # PM: Alright , okay . # ME: so we don't want to have any harm to the society , # PM: Fruit and veg , well there you go . # PM: Just what I think of when I think of a remote control . # UI: A remote control ? . # UI: And were there any factors that weren't important in the survey , that they said we don't want ? # ME: S we didn't find out any such point . # UI: Or was it just # ME: yes , there could be , but we couldn't find out any , so # PM: Function F_ eight . # ID: No , it's got it's got it . # UI: and then F_ five , right ? # UI: okay , so the interface concept . # UI: The interface specification , what people how they interact with it basically , I think . # UI: so the method , we looked at existing designs , what are the what's good about them , what's bad about them , I looked at their flaws , so we're going to look at their flaws , everything . # UI: and what the survey told us and what we think would be good , so a bit of imagination . # UI: the findings , I've got some pictures to show you as well . # UI: Okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , where you have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a stream of text or something . # UI: and we also found that there's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing . # UI: So I think for our remote control There is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls , but I think standard kind of shape and play and those kind of but buttons like the top right for on and off or something , # UI: I think , people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use . # UI: And we've got some pictures of some new remote controls to show you . # UI: Do I press Escape F_ five ? Or just # PM: no just escape should # UI: , oh I still haven't got my glasses on . # UI: So these are the some of the pictures of existing ones . # UI: I'll just walk you through them . # UI: This one is a voice recognition . # UI: And that's the kind of idea we're going for . # PM: Looks pretty complicated . # UI: There's an L_C_D_ thing , which we thought could I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us . # UI: This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse , # PM: , like the middle button . # UI: and But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that , # PM: it's kinda like scrolling # UI: like would the computer come # PM: right , well , if I s if I'm thinking of the right one , I've got the same thing in front of my monitor , you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll . # UI: Uh-huh , that's like the L_C_D_ one , # UI: But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side . # UI: But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen . # UI: I think that's what that is . # UI: So these are just a few ideas . # UI: Again that's just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one . # ID: it looks threatening . # PM: , looks like looks like something out of a jet . # UI: , it does look kind of dangerous . # ID: It looks like # UI: this one I thought was really cool . # UI: It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about . # UI: You can put it in there , it's for your kids , and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool . # UI: And that's really easy to use , bright , so I like this one lot for our design . # UI: I think something like that would be good . # PM: , I m I mean the one thing I think about these ones is these kl secured areas , I've seen a lot of them with the cover missing . # UI: Of course yellow . # PM: So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever . # UI: so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the T_V_ or something . # UI: And this one , the over-sized one , I don't know about you , but I think it's a bit too gimmicky . # UI: I don't think that will sell very well . # PM: I mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something , is it ? # ID: Then d blind don't watch T_V_ . # UI: I think that's a bit exactly . # PM: No they do , they do . # PM: They listen to it . # UI: And this one is just pointing out . # UI: I like some of these things the raised symbols and everything , but pointing out that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape . # UI: So that could that's a bit confusing . # UI: but the buttons on this I think are it's just showing you how you can have different buttons . # UI: They don't have to be all the same . # UI: So that's quite cool . # PM: but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , don't they ? # UI: So there are some of the findings . # UI: So we need to combine those ones and I've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . # UI: it is , just in time , very handy . # UI: I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good . # UI: you program it like you say , record , and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , so that's And it's much So that's quite cool . # UI: personal preferences just some imagination , the raised symbols I thought were good , the L_C_D_ , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget , do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the # ID: The L_C_D_ and the other stuff , I think . # UI: And the speech recognition , 'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition , # ME: But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , but they want the quality , they want f fancy look , they want some new design , something new . # UI: Uh-huh . But our budget , we've # PM: It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know . # ME: So even if we increase our cost little bit , within some limits , and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook , I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market . # UI: I'm not sure if the if for twenty five Euros per twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost , . # PM: I can't see tha Although , th I mean to be to be sure they have got I mean they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now , # PM: so that you've got your L_C_D_ T_V_s and everything so maybe the small But I mean like I the black and white , I guess , it just doesn't look funky enough . # PM: but , I mean , like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour L_C_D_ screens , w I ju I mean I wouldn't know about the costs of them . # ID: But price not withstanding , is it too complicated , is it gonna be too much just overload ? # PM: Twelve fifty . # ME: i it will be easy because there will be , on L_C_D_ s screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click ok okay , whatever they wa # UI: , that's the thing , because # ID: But but the thing is when you use a remote control , you never look at it , You're looking at the T_V_ and it's # ID: It just seems kind of like a needless th # UI: And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_ . # UI: It's a it's great , it's a good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , I think . # UI: Child-friendly , I thought this was good , as you pointed out the bit , it often goes missing especially with children , but it's a good shape and the organic is kind of we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , I think . # ID: So which vegetable ? # PM: Well I mean we could make a # UI: , I know , carrot . # PM: Well , si since we're going for the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon wasn't that far s # ID: The the lemon . # ID: Well what are the options ? # PM: And if it doesn't work you know , we've just made a lemon . # UI: But we don't want it to be the child-friendly , . # UI: Easy to use , it seems quite easy to use . # UI: I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff . # PM: I like I like the colourful buttons as well . # UI: I think that's a good idea to go for . # UI: And the mouse one , I thought it was a good idea , because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing . # PM: I mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five , so most people will have come in contact with that kind of use . # UI: So they'd be able to use that , as I said I think i I'd presume it would come up on the screen . # UI: so there you go . # PM: And that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the T_V_ maker , so # UI: So that's the user interface design . # UI: So okay , I'll take this out now then . # ID: I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among , # PM: , looks like it . # ID: and I'll give you the , I guess , technical considerations for those . # ID: And I'm gonna use the whiteboard , just 'cause we haven't used it . # PM: , I was just thinking the self same thing . # ID: Right . So , the way I'm gonna do this is we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , reuse the vital kind of essential pieces of it , and then we'll throw in our new innovations and keep it all within budget . # ID: So , looking inside a very simple remote control . # ID: this is what they sent me . # ID: 'Kay . Here's the competition , I suppose . # ID: you open it up , there's a circuit board inside , and there's a chip , a processor , the T_A_ one eight three five , which receives input from the buttons , # PM: So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ? # ID: it's very they're very cheap remote . # ID: This remote costs nothing , you know . # ID: so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the to the L_E_D_ light , which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end , and that sends out the infrared light signal to the television . # ID: so this is kind of the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , because it defines the # PM: So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ? # ID: R no , I mean this is a very old one , so now with the new technology this is a minimally small and cheap thing to make . # PM: They gotta be Almost a key-ring . # ID: So this is what we need to have for certain . # ID: So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be , the board we have to use basically the same set-up , processor , we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard . # ID: so for the casing , this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot , latex , double-curved , curved . # ID: So lots of choices , what do we think ? # ID: or sponge , I guess , isn't on there , right . # UI: Mm . I'm not sure about the sponge . # ID: Organic sponge . # PM: Well , I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , doesn't it . # ID: , it's very elasticy for sure . # PM: And that would k also give it kinda durability and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast . # PM: so maybe s a sort of plastic initial plastic with a latex kinda sheath ? # ID: Okay so , here are a plastic , # UI: I like the rubber , the stress balls , I think , # PM: Oh right , okay . # UI: you know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and # PM: I don't know what that stuff is . # ID: So something with give to it . # UI: And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around . # ID: and the colour is yellow , right ? # PM: Or at least incorporating , . # UI: y yellow incorporated , . # PM: I mean I forgot i we're sort of I don't know what other standard silver kind of # PM: Other parts or # UI: the buttons w like , 'cause there's gonna be the cover the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours or i if we're having buttons actually , # ID: So yellow for the body , and then what colour for the buttons ? # PM: I quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . # ID: So multi-coloured buttons . # UI: You do have ones like play could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , . # PM: or a limit maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it doesn't look too childish , perhaps . # UI: Makes it easy to use . # UI: , that's true , because that blue one did look quite hardish . # PM: Although I mean this uh also comes to shape as well . # PM: I mean if we are gonna make it a novel I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , a bit comfier , you know . # ID: Mm 'kay so the shape we wanna go how exactly ? # ID: Maybe double # UI: Like an hour glass kind of figure , is that what you're thinking of , # PM: it's , that that'd be that's sort of comfortable to hold , easy to hold so you don't drop it . # UI: or just like a It's not # ID: What about a banana ? # UI: We could make novelty remote controls . # ID: Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , # ID: 'cause it's yellow fruit , # PM: Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . # UI: But then how would you point it ? # UI: How would you point it ? # ID: Oh i it doesn't matter which end you point , I guess . # ID: We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end . # ME: I appreciate this idea , # PM: They only cost pennies . # ME: because then this will help us in our advertisement also and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices . # ME: That what our data shows that , so this w this w # UI: y I'm not sure about the banana idea . # ID: So a spongy banana re # PM: I mean that th # UI: Rubber banana . # PM: it does seem a bit again childish maybe . # UI: I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape . # UI: And what else did you say about fashions ? # UI: What was trendy ? # ME: the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables , like people now # PM: And sponginess . # ID: So maybe an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable # ID: like so it would have a stem perhaps maybe a it'd be s axially symmetric . # UI: Like what's that , I don't even know the name of it , some kind of , you know where it's like looks like a little snowman kind of thing . # UI: I don't know the name of that . # ID: So it'd look like this kinda . # UI: , that's what I was thinking . # ID: Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ? # UI: , maybe that's what they are . # UI: 'Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit # ID: and it has a clear top and bottom so y so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end . # PM: , why the hell not . # PM: that'll make us fifty million Euros . # UI: What do you guy What do you think ? # PM: I guess it's kind of dra you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , # ME: , then only we can relate it with something . # PM: , we can relate it by advertising or # ID: Okay , so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ? # ME: Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . # PM: There's a good man . There's a good idea . # ID: Okay , I guess , since you're the marketing guy . # ME: , sure . I will be happy to do that . # ID: Okay , we could do that . # UI: And buttons would , did we say ? different shapes of buttons ? # PM: I mean for the specific functions , you know , up and down , play , stop . # PM: They've got , I mean , they've got standard sort of intuitive # PM: things that are always used . # ID: Okay , just like that . # ID: With the scroll-wheel or no ? # UI: , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? # PM: speech recognition , I think , so we need a microphone presumably . # ID: I could put the microphone here . # ID: Okay there's the microphone . # ID: Where should I put the microphone ? # PM: I mean ho h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ? # UI: I mean those ideas I saw were just for inspiration , I think . # PM: Glad , we're not doing this for real . # UI: no I'm not sure . # ID: Okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ? # PM: And I think if this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone # ID: So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or # PM: I would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it's # ID: 'Kay there's the mic . # PM: So it can be sort of held and w # PM: We really need really gonna need to hold it , if it's gonna be voice recognition . # ID: n well we can Whoops . # UI: So let's not use the whiteboard any more . # UI: And so what else was there ? # UI: What about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ? # PM: I s I still like it . # UI: Are we just gonna leave that ? # UI: You still like it . # UI: 'Cause we've got the technological innovation with the speech recognition system . # PM: Yes , or maybe it's just going a bit too far . # PM: I mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes . # UI: 'Cause it could # PM: don't wanna sort of overkill . # UI: Especially with yellow . # PM: 'Cause I mean like if we I mean how good is the speech recognition thing ? # PM: Do we want to go for buttons at all , do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ? # UI: Then you put it in the fruit bowl ? # ID: They can work from a # PM: you know , and then you just tal # ID: You don't have to hold it . # PM: I mean like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly . # ID: I it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers , you know they have fruits all round them . # PM: Make them make them think of fruit , . # ID: Now just make sure they don't eat the remote . # UI: , do we need buttons ? # PM: l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like , I dunno , an apple . # PM: Then it's just apple so sort of , yellow apples though . # UI: I quite like the shape . I quite like the design of that , 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got a quite steady base . # PM: Okay , that's good . # UI: and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know . # ID: But , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close . # ID: It can sit at a distance and pick it up still . # PM: So I mean like you could actually # PM: , gives you the options . # ME: we can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . # ME: So whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay , # PM: So a selection of casings . # ME: it will look l In that w # PM: It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing # UI: 'cause you said about disposable , # UI: You said about disposable earli people want disposable things # ME: like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover , # UI: so we could do that , like have a choice . # ME: If somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look . # PM: Like like mobiles , . # ME: If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put we will put apple shape casing on that . # ME: It will give apple shape look . # ME: So in that way you can have any , that means whatever you want , without . # UI: We still need the buttons in the same places thought , # ME: button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . # PM: You can standardise those , # ME: buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , # UI: Oh , that's the other side . Oh , okay . # ME: so half of that will be look the # UI: Oh , half a fruit . Oh , okay , okay . # ME: , not the upper side . # ME: So from lower you can , it means while you are holding of from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look , whatever . # ME: So in that way we need not to d have different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . # PM: I think tho I think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons , 'cause when if you think about it if they're wanting it , 'cause they want to look at it , if they're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them . It doesn't really You know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it , unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down . # PM: And you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the # PM: So you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options . # ID: s I guess we decided on material , So that spongy latex rubber everything feel , and the colours we got down , and the shape , maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or # UI: Well , because Well , I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and because what # PM: so we stick with what we've got there . # UI: w I think wh wha would we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . # UI: They wanted something that looks fancy and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . # UI: I mean we could make it nice pale yellow . # PM: Well , it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow . # PM: So again I mean like we could have , I mean , we could quite easily have the main body be a different colour , but have # UI: Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan . # PM: kinda going round , . # PM: I mean e even if # PM: I mean not necessarily that the whole body has to be of the company colour , so you know blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . # PM: So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing . # ID: as for the energy source , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , but we don't have to be limited by that . # ID: We can use a hand-dynamo . # ID: I don't know what that means , we crank it ? # PM: It's I think it's basically the more you move i it , it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda powers it . # ID: Right , it's like those watches that you c So , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power . # UI: Oh , a d a dynamo ? # UI: , like with those watches that you kind of twist . # UI: that's quite cool . # ID: Okay . So if it if it's not working , I guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing . # PM: You shake it and scream at it . # ME: But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ? # ME: Because then people have to , well like if the cell is out of bat # PM: It does leave them with an obligation to Especially if they want to use it uh sp specifically as voice activated . # ME: because most of the people # PM: Then if it's just sitting on the # UI: , then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then . # PM: Right what are the other options ? # ID: there's solar power . # ME: , solar power will w also not be a good idea , because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy , and the days when there is no sola sunlight # PM: I'm with Raj on that , # ID: Okay , so probably just # PM: I think , you know , # PM: I've got I've got no I've got a north facing house , there's not really ever sun coming in my window . # ME: I think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea . # UI: But w like just normal light ? # PM: Oh that's true . # ME: They can they can recharge it . # PM: I mean I w I w that idea that I thought just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother is having a , # UI: And we're a very environmentally friendly company , aren't we as well ? # PM: having a rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as a stand , but for using it as recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . # UI: Like like a hand like one of those portable phones kind of thing . # ME: , that's , exactly . # PM: that kind of thing . # ID: So a rechargeable battery . # ID: the user interface , the buttons , I guess we talked about this already . # PM: Rechargeable . # PM: . What's chip on print ? # PM: Sorry , never mind . # ID: the electronics , basically the more features we add Oops , this one . # ID: So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in , which adds to the cost as you can expect . # ID: But I think we can keep it all under budget . # ID: so the speech thing you said our techno our research and development department came up with some break-through . # ID: So just in time . # PM: and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping . # ID: and keeping the L_C_D_ screen out . # PM: Okay , we're kind of we're kind of Excuse m I've just deleted that whole thing . # PM: we're kind of running out of time , so if you could Was that you ? # PM: that was your bit's covered , # ID: Oh that was that was it . # PM: I just dele I just accidentally deleted what I was supposed to say next . # ME: excuse me , Bri # ID: So control F_ eight , right ? # UI: , mine seems to have turned off . # PM: And I just touch the pad . # UI: I can't do anything . # ME: You just touch the pad , . # PM: It's actually shut down . # UI: It's on , but there's nothing on the screen . # PM: Okay , now what we have # ID: Try flipping the screen down . # PM: our next meeting's in half an hour and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay . # ID: I get to do it , too . # PM: So , you know I mean , luckily we chose a nice simple shape . # PM: and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches . # ID: Okay . Save everything to the shared documents , is that right ? # PM: I hope I can recover this , 'cause I've accidentally deleted it . # PM: Which doesn't really help me much . # UI: I think , I've saved mine already . # PM: , can you save that send that last one again , please , Raj , as I still can't find it on the # ME: it was under a different name . # ME: I will show you , in shared documents . # ME: working components . # ME: Oh , you didn't get that . # ME: I will send new . # PM: Okay , thank you . # ME: I'll put it in shared documents , again . # PM: , Project , Project Documents . # ME: Project documents , I put it in the shared documents . # PM: that's the that it goes there automatically if you put it in Project Documents . # PM: Project Documents is on the desktop . # ME: Right , that's great . # ME: But I cou can't open that , because it w asks for some username or password . # ID: these lapel mics are trouble . # PM: Oh right , I think Hold on . # PM: , I don't know if y it just ca it just came up on my on my agenda . # PM: presumably there's clay somewhere . # PM: Light , light , please . Light . # PM: Right , there you go . # PM: And we're using this our basic chip set , so it's all good . # ID: Are we done with our meeting ? # ME: excuse me , Brian . # PM: I think we're almost done , . # ME: You have to keep your pen separate , because I used your pen . # PM: okay , still didn't manage to get down all the last bits so we had rechargeable and . Apples . # PM: 'Kay , so we came up with that , that's okay . # PM: What's supplements ? # PM: Supplements . # PM: I shoulda something like that . # PM: If I kn see I knew that . # PM: I shoulda sort of engineered it so we k ended up making a diffi difficult shape . # PM: Just for cruelty . # PM: I wonder if they mean like literally make it , sort of buttons and everything . # ME: So sh should Should we leave now , Brian ? # UI: Oh , we can do buttons . # ME: Or we are going to discuss something ? # PM: no , I think that's us our discussion over unless anybody's got questions or confusions , # PM: 'cause I'm confused . # PM: we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute , # PM: There we go . Warning , finish meeting now . # PM: I rounded it up far too fast . # PM: Where are we going ? # PM: My Documents , that's not what I want . # PM: My Project Documents .
# ID: Okay , almost there . # PM: We'll sta I'll use the PowerPoint , I guess . # PM: How was that , was that fun ? # PM: oh I've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but I will do . # ME: E excuse me I forgot my # PM: Alright , okay , . # PM: He's gonna get his pen . # UI: Oh right . Okay . # PM: Will you guys first with your prototype before we get to the good news ? # ID: there's good news ? # PM: we have budget problems . # PM: I'm afraid you're all sacked . # PM: I don't even have this on . # PM: Okay , have you got a presentation to make ? # ME: No , not mine yet . # PM: No . Okay so it's just your show . # ID: maybe we should bring so that the camera can see . # UI: We made three for you . # UI: one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato # PM: Tomato ? What tomato ? # UI: and the other one is st # PM: I don't recall a tomato . # UI: Oh , well , we had v some red left over . # UI: So . Okay , so this is the non to non no buttons one , or as mm few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition . # UI: The yellow there is the slogan , # PM: Okay , brilliant . # UI: that we need to incorporate , it's very simple . # UI: If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , but mainly it's speech recognition . # PM: Okay , so the buttons would be like , you know individual users , or # UI: they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there . # PM: Alright , okay . # UI: Mm I'm not sure about that . # UI: and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier . # UI: , you guys can have a look at that if you want . # PM: That's groovy . # PM: Well I like the feel of it , I like the feel of it . # UI: Oh no , it's delicate . # UI: That's that's already got its stand that one . # UI: That's it stand . # PM: Alright , okay . # UI: It does also lie flat , but that's the that yellow stand there represents the charging stand . # PM: Okay , brilliant mm . # UI: the black on the back is the slogan . # PM: Okay , nice and obvious there , # UI: Well , we did think of that . # PM: if it's standing up , I guess , . # UI: , if it's standing up it's on there , but also we're gonna have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle . # PM: Oh right , okay , brilliant . Like that from its centre . # UI: So and that's the transmit the L_E_D_ thing . # UI: These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down . # UI: We n were weren't sure about putting them there , because i it's it kind of could get bashed . # PM: Where you're , were you're holding it kind of # UI: Well , if you hold it , you can you all can hold it , it does actually feel quite ergonomic , if you've got small hands . # UI: , obviously I don't think that's real sized . # UI: It would have to be a bit bigger . # UI: that's a speaker at the top , so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition . # UI: then the buttons . # UI: kind of self-explanatory , just buttons whenever you need them . # UI: Tried to keep it simple . # UI: Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom . # PM: Alright , excellent . # UI: We used those . # UI: And then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one . # UI: It's not in the traditional place , but it's quite an obvious place . # PM: It's out of the way as well , I suppose , so . # UI: So there we go and we have the banana-based one too . # ID: This one is , I suppose for the younger audiences . # ID: A a more friendly type of # PM: , so Barney the banana . # ID: It's to induce more television watching I suppose or # PM: excellent , just what we need . # ID: Say it for the camera . # PM: Lo Sort of Loch Ness banana . # PM: Well , nice to have options at least . # UI: So are there any improvements or issues or # ID: It won't stand . # PM: Oh there are issues , oh there are issues . # ID: Just let it lie down , it wont stand . # PM: main problem that we have unfortunately being finance . # PM: , let's just enter in the evaluation criteria . # PM: unfortunately the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros . # ID: What's on the on the left ? # PM: rea Sorry , I've accidentally highlighted somehow There we go . # PM: why is it doing that ? # PM: So basically , in order to save our two Euros I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened . # UI: More like a traditional remote control . # PM: I mean it's already got a kind of cool shape , so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out . # PM: And by doing so Oh no , hold on . # PM: Doesn't save us quite as much . # PM: I don't know what's going on with this again . # ID: W why is the double curved two of them ? # PM: Oh , good point . # ME: And double curve on both sides ? # ME: this is double-curve , # PM: That's sort of curve in and out . # ME: This is double-curve . # ME: This one is single curve . # ME: 'Cause this is single curve , this is curved on both sides . # ME: So double-curve . # PM: I think it means double curved as in # UI: Like an S_ shape . # PM: like a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward . # PM: Okay , I might be wrong though . # ME: Like this , one curve on this side , one curve on that side . # PM: I don't think that counts as a curve , I think that's just a shape . # PM: A curvature is like the this case . # ID: 'Cause that's the biggest expense there , right . # ID: got two of them # PM: and why I've got it two , I don't know , I can't seem to select any more however . # ID: Well we can work around that # ID: Cut things out . # ID: But you think it should be one . # PM: It's meant to be one , I don't know why I put two in there , Hold on till I find it , I think this shift button might be stuck again . # PM: No maybe the shift button's stuck in . # PM: okay , so that would take away three , which would give us # PM: Oh that's fine . # PM: Eleven eleven Euros sixty . # UI: So we could even add something . # PM: We cou Oh not quite , have the scroll-wheel , unfortunately . # ID: We should fire the accountants . # ID: Fire the accountants . # ID: , we could add things . # ID: Maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell , where you're starting from , and then use the arrow keys . # ID: Does that work ? # PM: , I know , that just extends it as well . # ME: you can do one thing . # ME: You just select one box outsi , this box . # ME: Then move it with the help of this # PM: It One of the buttons is sticking , I don't know . # ME: Just just Okay , just a minute . # ME: No input , like this . # PM: No , it's 'cause the shift button's stuck , or something . # ME: , it's not working . # ID: Is it the other shift button maybe ? # ME: Should we ask Meli Should we ask our technical expert Melissa ? # PM: No that's fine . # PM: we've worked out what it would be anyway . # ID: Did you try both shift buttons ? # ID: It could be the other side . # PM: Cancel . Piss off . # ID: That's too bad . # PM: Oh well , never mind . # PM: Right , so that's finances and I dunno what we what could we reckon we could add ? # UI: Well maybe we could add something , but maybe if # PM: Well I suppose that's our that's our design that we've got . So # UI: What do you th We're trying to save money , so . # UI: , if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to . # UI: But if there is anything you think we've missed out there , then , you know , feel free to add it . # UI: I mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the slogan on the front , because it's not in an ideal place right now . # PM: Well that's Okay , so project evaluation . # PM: We have under twelve Euros fifty . # PM: Project process , how do we think that went ? # ID: I think we have a winning product . # PM: Oh we've been writing this up for m months . # UI: I think it went quite smoothly . # PM: room for creativity , were we happy with that ? # UI: W I think we were very creative . # PM: No , I mea I think it means sort of individually . # UI: Oh right , okay . # PM: So we're just gonna . # ID: Great leadership . # UI: Excellent leadership . # PM: Thank you very much . # PM: You're all get you're all getting a raise . # PM: teamwork . I thought went well . # UI: , everyone got enough input , I think . # PM: and well means , . # PM: The technical stuff was brilliant . # PM: Let's buy more . # ID: These pens are neat though . # PM: I don't know what , new ideas found , means , to be honest . # ME: , these are new ideas , like glow-in-the-dark or something like that . # ME: We discussed all the new ideas , but of course we couldn't reach any proper goals , we couldn't use these , but we h we are using these scroll buttons like this . # ME: These are new ideas we And new shapes , everything # PM: Mm 'kay . Groovy . # PM: So just general thumbs up for all of us then . # PM: That kind of unfortunately is too quick . # ID: so let's talk about our bonuses and the raises we're getting for this , right . # PM: That's it , I think another couple of days holiday pay might be well in order for all of you . # PM: Let's see if I can get this bloody thing to work . # ID: maybe we should start cleaning up the clay . # PM: Does it go back in , does it ? # ID: Something we should get . # PM: I don't know what this is but it's really annoying . # ME: Brian , have you have you finished ? # ME: mine needs also this . # ME: At last mine is also the presentation . # PM: Oh right , okay , you've got more , okay . # UI: Oh , you got a presentation , # PM: It didn't bother to tell me that on this # ME: is the project evaluated , that is mine . # PM: Doesn't tell me . # PM: Oh you're doing that . # PM: We evaluated ourselves , we thought we were great . # UI: Mm , love to eat that now . # UI: Kind of a green banana now . # ID: Clay covered banana . # UI: this as well , we forgot to mention it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex , new material that we've got . # PM: I wonder w which cell do I want . # ID: It's fun to touch . # PM: Okay , I didn't realise you had that bit . # UI: Oh could you pass the tomato please . # UI: Sorry . Thank you . # ME: So now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh of our product . # ME: How we are going to means at what standard what standard whether it meets our standards or not . # ME: What rating we will give to these products . # ME: So of course this is will be a team work , w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything . # ME: So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this . # ME: We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product . # ME: Then trends , whether it is as fashion trends or not ? # ME: Means because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays . # ME: So this is also an important factor for our evaluation also . # ME: Then marketing strategy of the company . # ME: As we have already discussed that our company is quite in the market , not only in terms of providing quality products , not only in pro providing latest technologies , but also in terms of providing environmental s # ME: but also in terms of providing environmental safe products , like keeping in mind all the safety issues . # ME: Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale . # ME: I'm having this scale this scale , so we have to do it on a board . # ME: the user requirem I think . # PM: Alright , okay . # PM: The board working again , is it ? # ID: Do we have the marker for the board ? # ME: So these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product . # ME: First of all comes user requirement . # ME: So we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not . # ME: I will first I would like to have your views , what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ? # UI: I think It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the new technology that people said they wanted . # PM: When the user requirement is essentially just to operate the T_V_ , # ME: So what do you think you will personally give . # PM: of course we haven't actually got a working model yet . # UI: I would say seven . # UI: Seven is good , isn't it ? # UI: True or false ? # UI: No sorry tr one is true . # ME: one is means highest ranking , But I think highest ranking is seven , # PM: No it's like true is one end , and false is the oth # ID: No that's false . # ME: So it's one for from your point of view . # ME: And what do you say our Industrial Expert ? # ID: It's hard to know . # ID: I give it a two . # ME: d you can you can tell on the like I think she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our i Interface Expert . # ME: But you can give your views based on technology , whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ? # ID: , I think i it might even exceed it . # ID: But I guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons . # ID: I'm gonna give it a two . # ME: And what about you , Brian ? # PM: Oh , I'll go for a one . # ME: You will go for one . # PM: Basic requirements but of the pro of the project . # ME: for me personally it is everything fine , it may be having good design , it may be meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise , price-wise , but there is one thing which limits the customers , like we are having only two , three designs , like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange , # ME: And the third one is what you ge that is not a f fruit look . # ME: But if a person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him . # PM: Come on that was the tha # ME: No , don't buy our product , because we are l we like this only . # ME: So we are showing our preference for particular fruits , # PM: Being fruitist . # ME: two or three kinds rather , # UI: Is that no is that not trends ? # ME: no , personally as a Marketing Expert I don't believe that , because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give a variety of different things . # ME: Some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape . # ME: So you can what shape a person will like . # ME: So in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers . # ME: And by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also . # UI: But in electronics , I think , it's not q always quite so you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates . # UI: I think , you know , if you're going to buy a T_V_ maybe a company'll have That you're going to choose from , a company'll have two or three choices , but they're different designs . # UI: We were coming up with one product . # ME: maybe . Okay but I will I will personally won't give it beyond three . # UI: No , I mean obviously your opinion , I'm just trying to # PM: He's a tough cookie . # ME: , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , maybe . # ME: Three or four ? # ME: , no sorry , it should be # PM: Six . Five or six . # UI: What are we doing ? # ID: What are we doing ? # ME: sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , we are doing a very wrong thing . # UI: Adding them up ? # ID: We're gonna average them ? # ME: we are taking everything , # ID: Okay . So seven fourths . # ME: and that's I have taken it very wrongly . # ID: About one point f one point eight . # ME: three four two six seven sev one pe exactly . # ME: So we can say one or two . # ME: because it is one point eight two , so we will do two . # ID: round it up to two . # ME: So where were the trends . # ID: Can you explain what you want us to write there ? # ID: How it how conforms to the current trends ? # ME: , again the fashion trends , this also like whether it will be fashionable to have these products in the as a fruit shape or something . # UI: Well going on the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it , well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that looks cool , you know , so I would actually give it a three . # UI: Tha three or four , I'm not sure . # UI: Three . Go for three . # ID: 'Kay . As far as the technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it's missing the screen , as we said , but it does have the push-buttons , or the scroll-buttons , but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the vibrating energy mechanism . # ID: So I give it a four . # ID: I'd give it a kinda middle of the road for technology . # PM: , I am sort of pret Just the fruit does me in , I mean it might it might be trendy to some , but I'm just not swallowing the fruit , also I would have liked to have seen the L_C_D_ screen in it . # PM: so I'd say about four as well . # ME: personally I wi I think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , like , these products are in fruit shape , because that wha people now our fashion trend shows that people like everything all f everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them or showing some association with them . # ME: So and in this way our product is good . # ME: And the second thing , now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy . # ME: So that is also ef that also Our product meets the f the fashion trends of the market . # ME: It is cus spongy also . # ME: So they can play with it , it's quite good . # ME: So then I think , maybe I can give it two . # ME: So four five ten thirteen . # ME: So we can Is it fine ? # ME: So what about company strategy ? # ID: Well it was yellow . # UI: , the company strategy , okay . # UI: there was lot of discussing , that was good . # UI: I feel I got my say . # UI: so I'd give the company strategy a two . # ID: Well , I think it's the remote control conforms to the company strategy . # ID: Is that the question ? # UI: Okay , so one or two . # UI: Okay , just leave it , it's fine . # ID: I'll go with two . # ME: So what about you , Brian ? # PM: Pretty much kept to the company strategy , so I would go for a one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by # ME: , and me also , like , this product me this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe . # ME: So since our product meets all these requirements , so I would also prefer to give it rank one . # ID: So one and a half . # ME: So we can say two or one So th seven . # ME: overall we are getting two something , but we can round it as two . # ME: So I think overall evaluation of our product is quite good . # ME: So we can launch it . # PM: In which case we are done . # PM: 'Cause we've evaluated and we are within budget . # PM: Champagne lunch anyone ? .
# PM: So , this is first meeting of this design project . # PM: and I like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you . # UI: I didn't receive it yet . # PM: this is the plan for today's meeting is firstly just to introduce the project briefly , although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . # PM: Then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more . # PM: then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the course of the design project and the meetings , specifically the whiteboard over there . # PM: then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it . # PM: And then that's it . # PM: So we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five . # PM: S so any questions ? # PM: not at this point . # UI: Not at this point . # PM: So this is our project . # PM: What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . # PM: we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . # PM: The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . # PM: There's the functional design of the remote control . # PM: We're going the way we'll do that I think is to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to work on that . # PM: similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together . # PM: and then the detailed design will come after that . # PM: We'll pull it all together . # ID: I'm a bit confused about what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? # ID: i is it just more detail , as I understand it ? # PM: I think it th w we're talking the functional design is more your area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control and what specific things it has to do but the conceptual design is perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and that kind of thing . # ID: How how it will be done . # ID: whe where do we identify the components of our product ? # ID: I think it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? # PM: I think we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the project itself . # PM: what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for the project , specifically the whiteboard . # PM: each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . # ME: Why are you looking at me ? # PM: Would you like to go first ? # ME: Do I have a choice ? # ME: Ooh ooh , things falling everywhere . # PM: p put them in pockets . # PM: You don't have to hurry , we've got plenty of time . # ME: So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey # PM: It's got no eyes . # ME: Oh , good point . # ME: , the eyes always ruin it . # ME: Okay , what do it's eyes like ? # ME: this is a rabbit . # PM: I thought it might be a cat . # UI: well origi at first I thought it was going to be cat . # ME: I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit . # UI: now I now I understand now , . # PM: I can see by the ears . # ME: Okay , right , it's a fluffy rabbit , blue . # ME: Rabbits don't come in blue but you know . # ME: okay and I like it because it's small and it's fluffy . # ME: And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink . # PM: Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ? # ME: I am the I need my notebook , top banana . # ME: Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert so like I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design , trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design # PM: And more about yourself , you're from ? # ME: I'm from Leicester , second year . # ME: what else do you want to know ? # ME: I like sports , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning # PM: But not with rabbits . # ME: not with rabbits , no . # ME: And vets , I like vets as well . # ME: And and I like cocktails , especially pink ones . # PM: Excellent , to match the rabbit . # UI: so my name is Maarika . # UI: Where's the pen ? # PM: There's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off . # UI: or I can make it smaller . # UI: I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m I mean I'm not so sure because I'm not so very familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs . # UI: Oh , sorry , maybe I should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay . # ID: That's not bad at all . # PM: it looks like a dog . # ME: Is a bit more impressive than my rabbit . # ME: I think it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though . # UI: maybe it has some colourful patches , . # PM: the other legs are on the other side . # UI: and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal . # UI: well that's compared to some other animals like cats . # UI: they're really much more fun because they are not so independent . # UI: maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , . # UI: what it has to do with my role in the project is hard to say . # UI: I hope to be loyal to the project and not to n not to let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , . # PM: And where are you from ? # UI: I'm from Estonia # UI: so is there anything else you'd like to know ? # UI: Oh , right , my roles , so in the different stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for , designing the technical functions of the of the remote control then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to come up with interface concept and then in the last stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design . # UI: Okay , that's it . # ID: Okay I'll do some I'll rub the features and let the drawing stay . # ID: my name is Gaurav . # ID: my favourite animal one of my favourite animals is a cow . # ID: I've got no idea how to draw a cow . # ID: this is going to be # ME: They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs # ME: and then just some horns . # ID: Okay , so let me draw the body first . # ID: Big , round body , really skinny legs and they've got a long tail and a long face . # ME: It looks like Eeyore . # ID: And there is some grass there . # ID: So this is what I like about cows that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , # ME: draw some horns . # ID: they do not disturb anybody they're kind of Buddhist in a way . # ID: So , I like cows . # ID: my role in the project is the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of the product ho how it works and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it during the conceptual design , what are the various components of it and finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part . # ID: the detailed design , I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other . # ID: I'm from India . # ID: I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . # PM: Right , now it's my turn obviously . # ID: That doesn't look like a cow , does it ? # PM: Okay , here's a space . # UI: It looks very cute . # PM: I like the cow . # PM: I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can . # ME: Is that a lizard ? # ME: Is there a difference ? # UI: Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they # PM: They're , they're l it's a kind of lizard . # PM: And I like geckos because they remind me of warm places and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . # UI: I hope you don't like snakes , # PM: I don't like snakes . # PM: I come from Australia and we have nasty snakes . # PM: That's where I'm from , Australia . # PM: I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . # PM: So , let's see what's next in the PowerPoint presentation . # PM: So , I've just thought # ME: If you right click on it you can # PM: I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as there we go . # PM: Okay , so this is the overall budget for our project . # PM: We've got we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes . # PM: we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each . # PM: and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros . # PM: And that's selling them on the international market , not just in the U_K_ . # PM: so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that profit target . # PM: So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing . # PM: This is let me just skip ahead to see that's the last thing , We've only got a couple of minutes . # PM: Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about what we're thinking of this remote control ? # UI: I'm just wondering whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . # PM: I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us , but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be included in this remote control that are out of the ordinary . # ID: I think i in the beginning one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . # PM: Something something new . # ME: , I was looking at the website , and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . # ME: So the motto is we put the fashion in electronics and so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? # ME: So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . # ME: You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ? # PM: So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or # ME: Something that's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? # ME: But what do most people do ? # ME: They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . # ID: There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , # ME: Sometimes they play a movie . # ID: but will be used ten percent of the time , . # ME: there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , maybe to do # PM: It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . # ID: And then use the # ME: So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . # ME: 'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing # PM: Oh I haven't had a look yet , # ME: but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too . # PM: Any other immediate thoughts before we move along ? # ID: we can aim for I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , every now and then you need to replace the batteries . # UI: but I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't go like too far away from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems # ID: A big learning curve , . # UI: with l learning , . # ID: So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a # PM: It's like those fancy websites that you can't access because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great . # PM: so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . # PM: we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design , # PM: you're looking at the technical functions design , and for you it's the user requirements specification , like you said at the start . # PM: Thanks for that . # PM: I'll see you in half an hour . # PM: Carry the laptops back again . # PM: Do we need to unplug things ?
# PM: All hooked up . # PM: Okay , so now we are here at the functional design meeting . # PM: hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . # PM: The agenda for the meeting , I put it in the sh shared documents folder . # PM: I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not . # PM: I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there's a shared project documents folder . and it should be in there . # UI: Oh project documents , okay . # PM: Project documents , . # PM: So I'll put it in there . # PM: Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it's there ? # UI: Yes , I think so . # PM: I'll do that next time . # PM: I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting . # PM: The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . # PM: then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . # UI: the last minute , # PM: at the last minute , I'm sorry about that , but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing . # PM: then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . # PM: And we've got forty minutes to do that in . # ID: You said targ target groups , what does that mean ? # PM: As who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to , # PM: So we need to , we need to have a fairly defined group that we want to focus on and then look at the functions of the dem remote control itself . # PM: So with that I think it's best if I hand over to you . # PM: Does anyone have a preference for going first ? # ID: I can go first , # PM: You wanna go first ? # PM: so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours . # PM: I assume we just pull it out ? # PM: Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back , # UI: Okay , afterwards , okay . # PM: just so that I don't have to scribble everything down . # ID: So n with regard to the working design of this uh remote control I've identified a few basic components of the remote and se from the design , functional design perspective w I c we can now know wha what exactly the components are and how they work together with each other . # ID: this is the method that I'll mostly be following in my in my role . # ID: the identification of the components , and since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person and from the user interface person . # ID: we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level and basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process . # ID: Okay , so these were the basic findings from today . # ID: The last three bullets have been integrated from the last minute email . # ID: I just quickly jotted them down . # ID: basically the as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it and what are the different processes and how the parts communicate with each other . # ID: so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . # ID: also the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features makes it more comp complex . # ID: And the reason why teletext is outdated because of internet and the availability of internet over television . # ID: How however , our remote control would only be dealing with the use for television , in order to keep things simple . # ID: also the management wants that our design should be unique so it should incorporate colour and the slogan that our company has it as its standard . # ID: Okay , so he here is a functional overview of the remote control . # ID: there's basically an energy source at the heart which feeds into the chip and the user interface . # ID: The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so I'll basic go over to the if this is our energy source and this is a cell , it communicates it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h how to do everything . # ID: There is a user interface here . # ID: So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal , which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , which is then communicated to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver . # ID: the there can be a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . # ID: so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do , make the chip more complicated and bigger , basically . # ID: i in my personal preferences I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . # ID: This would help us to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . # ID: And also if we can incorporate the latest features in our chip design , so that our remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most televisions . # ID: That's about it . # ID: So anything that you would like to know or # PM: Do you have any i idea about costs at this point ? # ID: No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs . # PM: 'Cause that's something to consider , I guess , if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price . # ID: So so tha we definitely need to operate within our constraints , but unfortunately I do not have any data , so I just identified the functional components for that . # PM: Are there any more questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ? # UI: I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably . # PM: , I think that will do . # PM: Okay , so do you want to # UI: I think since we were discussing some design issues then I would like to continue # PM: shall we pull this up ? # PM: I think that has to come out of there . # PM: , I thought those last minute things , they're gonna hit you the worst . # UI: Okay , I hope Should it just # ID: I it'll take some time . # PM: It ta takes a little Oh , and have you # UI: There's just nothing . # PM: you need to then also press on yours , function F_ eight , # UI: Oh right , right , right , # PM: so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight . # ID: Oh , there it is , . # UI: okay , something is coming up . # PM: Now it's coming , # ID: It'll come up , no signal . # PM: computer no signal . # ID: it says something now , # UI: Oh . My my computer went blank now . # PM: Okay , adjusting . # UI: But I don't see anything # PM: There we go , there we go . # UI: I don't see anything on my computer now . # ID: Oh , that's strange . # PM: Oh , if you press if you press function and that again # UI: This is the problem , but # PM: there's usually three modes , one where it's only here , one where it's only there , and one where it's both . # ID: And one more time . # PM: Okay , so one more time . # PM: Should just wait for a moment , adjusting . # UI: Okay , that's fine , that's good . # UI: Okay , let's start from the beginning . # UI: So I'm going to speak about technical functions design just like some first issues that came up . # UI: so the method I was adopting at this point , it's not for the for the whole period of the all the project but it's just at th at this very moment . # UI: my method was to look at other remote controls , so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what functionality they used . # UI: And then after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what the user might desire as additional functionalities . # UI: And , and then just to put the main function of the remote control in words . # UI: so the findings were that the main function of the remote control is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . # UI: And w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , then the user would like to switch the channel for example just m changing to the next channel to flip through all of the possible channels , or then mm the other possibility would be that she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers . # UI: And and also the volume is very important . # ID: cou could you go back for a second ? # ID: switching on off channel , volume , okay , that's great . # UI: among the findings I found that m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm functionalities in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update actually we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . # UI: So my personal preferences would be to keep the mm the whole remote control small just like the physical size . # UI: And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something . # UI: , the must-have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . # UI: But then other functionalities could be just there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then , for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just done through the menu . # UI: the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update . # UI: So at the for the time being that's all . # UI: If you have questions # PM: I mean that was the directive that came through from management , but if we had a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see . # PM: It's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about . # UI: and also it's other question is because there are so many different And there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm video C_D_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to choose between all these possible things . # PM: Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ? # ID: So in the u user interface requirements uh we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want . # ID: so at this stage , how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or I mean in we can completely do away with buttons and have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . # ID: But is there any uh any thoughts on that ? # UI: well , I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most easy for the user to use , I mean what other options would you have ? # UI: A little screen or something , but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user # ID: and it'll make the costs # UI: and I mean the user just wants to get a result quickly , not to spend time in like giving several orders I dunno . # UI: I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , but if you have other mm proposals . # ID: I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them . # ID: So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that . # ID: i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display and with because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well . # PM: we can discuss that maybe after the next one . # ME: Do you wanna give me the little cable thing ? # PM: Do you want to # UI: am I going in the right direction ? # PM: Oh , I'm getting hungry . # UI: Okay , here it comes . # UI: Okay , here you are . # ME: that's why it won't meet . # ME: functional requirements . # PM: we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here . # PM: Is it plugged in prop # ME: So what I have , wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab observed remote control use with a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire . # ME: so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . # ME: What's the most annoying things about remote controls and the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control . # ME: Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens , so I should have taken that bit out , but anyway . # ME: What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . # ME: seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . # ME: the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense . # ME: eighty percent of users would spend more to get you know , a nice looking remote control . # ME: current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , as you'll see on the next slide . # ME: I dunno what zapping is , # PM: It's switching between channels , sort of randomly going through . # ME: But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on . # ME: okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , they just make it look ugly . # ME: so this is my little graph thing . # PM: Ooh , that's a bit difficult to see . # PM: If you explain it to us it'll be fine . # ME: Okay , well , I can send it to all of you . # ME: What it is it's cones , 'cause I thought they'd be more exciting . # PM: I liked the , I liked the litt # ME: ooh where's it go ? # PM: ooh come back . # ME: Okay , I'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing . # ME: okay , so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection . # ME: What you can't see is volume selection , it's a little bit higher than all the others . # PM: that's the next one along , ? # ME: so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses and so that's the numbers along the top represent their like their importance , you know , so on a scale of one to ten , how important is that and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it's not quite so essential , apparently , although I don't understand how it couldn't be , and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 'cause they're just not needed , and they're not used . # ME: This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing . # ME: So okay , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . # ME: that they get lost , that the you know , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . # ME: I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from you know , watching T_V_ , then that's the least of your problems , # PM: The remote control . # ME: but you know , it's up there . # ME: Okay , so I mean the R_S_I_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know , not straining your wrists watching T_V_ . # ME: Yes . Okay , cool . Right , this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table , and I didn't have time to white it out again . # PM: That's alright . # ME: but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software . # ME: So you can see from that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to try it . # ME: so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking and , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ . # ME: Cool . okay , so these are my personal preferences . # ME: So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that's , you know , a bit cool . # ME: you know , functional , so it's useful , but minimalist . # ME: there's a there's an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you're filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , and you've got all this stuff , and you're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ? You know , so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so I think we need to aim for both . # ME: okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit . # ME: and then like a locator , so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or not a mobile phone # ID: Some kind of a ring , # PM: Keys and things like that , # ME: , that's it , you know . # PM: Whistle and it screams at you , . # ME: I know , it's weird . # ME: My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything . # ME: So , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , something a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the T_V_ , you know , 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes , 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something . # ID: Okay , that's great , # PM: That's you , excellent . # UI: that's very good , # UI: very interesting . # PM: I'm just gonna tick yes . # PM: So , we've got about ten , fifteen minutes to discuss # ID: I think one of the very interesting things that came up in Ka Kate Cat Cat's presentation was this issue of uh like voice recognition being more popular with younger people . # ID: So if we need to have a target group then I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and you know , good looking we are better off targeting a younger audience then you know , people who are comparatively elderly . # ME: I mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , but I'm assuming , you know , yes . # ID: Bu but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , so if you want to put in something stylish , then th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people , # PM: Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket and the I don't know how often they're buying televisions . # ME: Well , that's when you go to uni , isn't it ? # PM: but you don't have much money , generally . # PM: I would've thought it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and # UI: you share a television or something that . # ID: But still , if you can go back to that slide and , how popular was it ? # ME: Oh , I've unplugged it . # PM: we unplugged it . # ME: Do you want me to # ID: That's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh people between twenty five to thirty five , how popular was # ME: Seventy six point three percent . # ID: so it was sti still quite popular amongst them . # UI: It was seventy something , . # ID: So even they are seventy six percent , is that high amount ? # ME: I kn I mean I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , but I mean it has been proven that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like I mean , you know , if you're at university , you're paying your rent , # PM: they've got no commitments and # ME: but you don't have a mortgage , you don't have a life insurance policy , # ME: you don't normally have a car , # PM: usually not a car and all of those things . # ME: You're still learning to drive actually , # ID: So you're more likely to b # ME: so that just costs more than a car , I mean like it is an age group to target , really , I think . # PM: and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price , that's not unaffordable , even for young people . # ME: I mean that's what , that's like fifteen Pounds ? # ME: You know , I think # UI: this is not unaffordable , but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a T_V_ to use its full # ME: I d I don't know many people without a T_V_ . # ME: We didn't have a T_V_ last year , # ME: and everyone thought we were off our heads , you know . # PM: But the T_V_s are often kind of someone's old T_V_ that's blah # UI: Common , the students The s the stu # PM: and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote . # UI: , and the remote control might not it might not even function with the old T_V_ . # ID: Bu but even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular , right ? # ME: , I d well we've got quite a d decent T_V_ . # UI: we're still Or w maybe we can just kind of uh # ME: I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . # ME: You know , so I mean that and the disposable income and I don't think it's something to ignore , you know . # UI: but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to have both of these groups as our target , because actually I mean they're all still re young people . # ME: Is not a massive difference , you know . # ME: No , do totally . # PM: , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition . # PM: Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs ? # ID: I was having a general outlook on m most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about , because one of the p things that Cat pointed out was uh how do we go about implementing it ? # ME: You do have it in your mobile phone though , don't you ? # ME: Because you have like I mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them . # ID: But how frequently do we use it anyway and h ho how good is it , you know voice recognition softwares are still quite # PM: With but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , louder , # PM: tha that should be relatively simple . # ME: y you'd maybe need a code word . # ME: Do you know what I mean ? # ME: So like when you say change , except that's being said quite a lot on T_V_ , so maybe like , you know , remote . # ME: I mean how often do people say remote on T_V_ ? # ME: Although I only watch Charmed , so really I wouldn't know but like so you'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine . # ID: so it seems like a feasible thing to implement for a limited # PM: but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check . # PM: , so if we go for the fifteen to thirty five age group and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , then they'll still go for the same advertising . # ME: I don't think there's a lot of voice recognition remote controls . # UI: w well now the v the voice recognition if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but I think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons and , it's kind of safer , so we need both , # PM: I think we need both . # UI: so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote . # ID: What wh what I was thinking is that there is this separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . # ID: If we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular in the sense that a person can say , I want to watch I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five . # ID: so if something like that can be incorporated , # ME: that would be another way to do it . # PM: So that if that was in the voice recognition , that would be great . # ME: , but then the code word would be even more important , because I mean Sky advertise on every channel , don't they , you know , so then it would be you'd be watching Charmed , and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky . # ME: and that would be really annoying . # PM: But that's definitely a possibility . # UI: but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't as close to you probably might just speak into it and the T_V_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there . # ME: Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ? # PM: So that you can yell at it , # ME: , you know , so you have to have the remote control . # ME: It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , . # UI: , but then the remote control I think I mean the idea is kind of it's not that it's sitting there on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you wouldn't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself . # ME: I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then # ID: and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control being cl I mean it'll mm . # UI: No , but I was just defending the fact why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and not to yell at it from the distance . # ID: So wh another thing that can be used is that there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ , so you can go and press that button and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , so we can probably come to know where it is . # PM: but then if you're buying the remote separately , but y you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something , some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ . # ME: , 'cause it's quite important that you don't lose the bit to locate the remote control . # PM: Well that's right , but it solves the problem of having different noises . # PM: I think we're gonna have to wrap this up . # PM: But if we go away with that kind of general specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option # UI: The major ones , . # PM: but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning . # PM: What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email . # PM: Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we've got a lunch break and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . # PM: I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know . # ID: So where exactly is this i # PM: It should be on your desktop , so on the So I'll put it I'll put them there as soon as I've written them . # UI: Did you find it ? # PM: , and email them round . # ME: Oh , so y you want our PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ? # PM: that would be great . # UI: Oh so we'll just put them i there , # PM: Oh , put them in there . , # UI: we , w we won't even okay . # PM: then you don't have to email them . # ME: But is everyone's called functional requirements ? # PM: they're all called something slightly different . # PM: Technical requirements and something , . # ME: Okay , so that's good . # ME: That's me done . # PM: So , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to . # PM: as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept . # PM: Whatever that means . # ID: I guess I'll find out . # PM: You'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept , # UI: something conceptual , . # PM: on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that we'll keep our options op ? # ID: Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? # ID: Con components , oh . # UI: but the next meeting are we going to have it right after lunch or shall we prepare our # PM: we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare , # UI: To prepare , okay , that's good . # PM: so that's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary . # PM: Right on time . # PM: so you can I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec ?
# PM: I sent you the agenda , it was on the in the project documents . # PM: I don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it . # PM: Anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . # PM: and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching . # PM: , do you wanna start again ? # PM: we've got forty minutes . # ID: so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation , # PM: You haven't made a PowerPoint , okay . # ID: I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead . # PM: Let's hope the pen holds out . # ID: okay , so basically I'll start off by I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that . # ID: Okay , so I'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control and then we can probably discuss the various components . # ID: so w what you see here is so this is the outside of the remote , right ? # ID: If you open it , you have a circuit board here , right , and this is the chip that I was talking about last time . # ID: This basically sends information to a tr transistor here , which then sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here . # ID: If you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here , everything else is kind of Okay , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like . # ID: So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ on pressing this button I a circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes out through there . # ID: So the important point that I read over the website was that the configurations of these printed circuit boards are quite cheap to make , you can ge get them printed as you want to , so w we can have a configuration irrespective of the cost , the way we want to have . # ID: Right ? So that's the important point here , so these are the different options that we have . # ID: So the batteries , I'll start with the battery , right ? # ID: So they can be simple which is like the normal batteries in our the cells , ? # ID: thes these are the kind different kind of batteries that the company makes , right ? # ME: Does that mean like a wind-up one ? # ME: A wind-up remote . # ID: So I don't know if even if you want to consider this , but these are the different things that the company makes , so th they'll since they'll come internally from the company , they'll be eas cheaper , all these options . # ID: So the third one is the kinetic energy ones . # ME: You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_ . # PM: And charging their remote , # ME: and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing , 'cause that's just # ID: , it's a good option . # UI: So what was what was this k ka # ID: The the kinetic energy one is that e uh they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking . # ID: But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes . # PM: For a remote , 'cause you # ID: But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it re recharges or something . # ID: And the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also made by the company . # ID: Environment friendly . # ID: Okay so I'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what we think from everybody's perspective . # ID: There are different cases that can be provided . # ID: They can be basically the shape of the cases , they can be flat , they can be curved with one-sided curved and one side flat , and they can be curved with on both the sides . # ID: These are the three options , right ? # UI: you mean this would be like the overall shape of the remote control , # ID: would it be flat on both the sides , would be curved from one side , or whatever there were different kind of supplements available , like it can be in plastic , rubber , wood , or titanium , right ? # ME: Did you say wool ? # ME: Wood . Oh right . # PM: A fluffy remote . # ME: , you'll understand why when we get to my presenta . # ID: so we can use even a certain titanium is also used in the company to make some space design equipment , so it's kind of it'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but it cannot be used on a double curved surface . # ID: If we choose this , we cannot use titanium . # ID: For for these two we can use titanium , wood , rubber , or plastic . # ID: the interface options now . # ID: we can have push-buttons , like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons . # ID: we can have scroll wheels like the ones on mouse pointers uh # ME: Sony Ericsson mobile phones has it . # ID: , something like that . # ID: So , and they have they can even have an integrated push-button inside the scrolling thing . # ID: The scroll plus push . # ID: So this is something that has been recently developed by the company , in the last decade , so not too recent . # ID: And L_C_D_s , we can have L_C_D_s . # ID: So these two are recent and this is q quite old . # ID: The various electronic options are so th this concerns firs first of all the chips I showed you at so there's a chip behind this one , right ? # ID: The P_C_B_ is inexpensive , so we can put in whatever we want , but the various integrated circuit options are , we have either a simple one or a regular or advanced . # ID: And the price goes up as we go down , obviously . # ID: okay , so the good thing about wh why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip . # ID: we need regular or advanced for scroll wheels . # ID: and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender . # ID: besides this in electr under electronics also the company has started making a sample sender , which is did not explained what i what it was , but I'm guessing that so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker . # ID: So I'm guessing that the sample speaker is probably something like you know , as soon as you press a button , it mm give gives you feedback , one five or whatever . # ID: I dunno whether sample sender has to do something with voice recognition or not , but anyway . # ID: So , these are the different options that we have . # ID: Okay , so th that's basically now I think that we can integrate you know , the user interface and the marketing things in that , keep taking out things from this and underlining things that are important , . # PM: Do you wanna stay somewhere near the board , so that if we need to # PM: you can sit down , but just we might need you to leap up . # PM: What are you , PowerPoint , or # UI: I have some PowerPoint , . # PM: Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand ? # PM: Some sort of radiation ? # ME: No it's got its little camera in there , plug it in . # ID: , it should do it . # PM: Right , interface concept . # UI: to be honest actually , I mentioned some of the things which could fit on the on the this talk this time , I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk . # UI: So , this time I might not have them on the slides but I can just mention them aw again . # UI: So I thought I would also include the definition of user interface so it's the aspects of a of a computer system or programme which can be seen by the user and which the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data . # UI: So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and voice recognition as well , and colour , and so on . # UI: the method I employed this time was a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then analyse them from the point of view of user fen friendliness and also whether their appearance was pleasant . # UI: and then this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product . # UI: So some findings . # UI: So in the case of many user interfaces , they're just so full of buttons that it's actually hard to find the ones you really want to use and it's just confusing , it takes y know time to learn . # UI: and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found . # UI: Okay , some of them are here . # UI: well the picture is not very clear , but as you can see , there are actu oi , oh , sorry for that . # ID: That's nice one . # UI: so , they're quite big and have many buttons . # UI: Actually of the of all these I personally p prefer this one , because it's the smallest and with least with the smallest number of buttons as well . # UI: And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice . # UI: So let's carry on with this . # UI: So o other findings some new things used , some of them were mentioned already by our Technical Designer . # UI: Our own company has developed a new in user interface no this is not the one . # UI: Okay , there is a we can include voice recognition and it allows i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it . # UI: so this one was already mentioned the L_C_ display . # UI: s another new development is a scroll button , which was also th also already mentioned . # UI: And our own manufacturing division ha has designed a new programmable speech mm sorry speaker unit I guess it's it should be . # UI: and this means that once uh it comes together with a voice recognition , but it's once the mm gadget recognises the voice of the speaker , there can be a pre-programmed answer , for example , you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever . # UI: So I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include . # ID: can you go back for a second ? # ID: are you sure wha what this means , a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display ? # PM: It's like the like you said , no ? # PM: The scroll wheel . # UI: the scroll button is a different thing . # UI: I have a picture if you just a moment , I'll show you . # UI: I wasn't completely sure myself , but I think it's just like it's a wheel , it's like not separate buttons . # ID: Oh okay , the iPod thing , . # UI: Look , this one here . # ME: Oh , it's like the iPod . # UI: But I'm not really sure whether you can really turn it round , # UI: it's like you press this or this or # ID: it's the iPod kind of # ME: It's like it's like where you know how you have your mouse , and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round # ID: Alright , right . Okay , okay . # ID: So instead of going down you just spin # ME: You just go round and it is a bit weird at first , but it's actually very like fast . # ME: I like the wheels that click on the side you get 'em much slower , so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff . # ME: Do you know , if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_ , then it's a lot faster than the wheel , but you've got a lot less control over it . # ID: So maybe I should include that here as well , L_C_D_s plus spinning . # UI: Okay , and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as last time . # UI: It it has to be small , simple . # UI: Okay , we decided to include voice recognition , so to have the standard major buttons like on , off , ch the channels and then volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen . # UI: and I also thought if we want to keep it small and nice and actually I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button , I thought it could be for voice like , I dunno , it mm like on a i like it used to be on Walkmans or something . # UI: There is I think there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for the remote control . # PM: Okay , straight to trends , and then we can discuss it all at once . # ME: Okay , I've put the copy of the presentation in the # PM: The project documents . # PM: If you two could both do that as well , in case we need to refer to it . # PM: Here it comes . # ME: Fabulous . Okay , cool . # ME: so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the near future . # ME: Now , the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect , which is twice as important as the third a aspect . # ME: So , I mean the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the which I think given the target group is what you would expect , really . # ME: , you know , people want something new , something technologically innovative and different , so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like , quite the thing to go for . # ME: And , it wants to look fancy , fancy look and feel . # ID: So maybe as you're discussing things , is it okay if we just keep highlighting things here ? # ID: Right . So mm so it # PM: That's over on the interface , if you could put # ID: so probably voice recognition is kind of important , right ? # PM: And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning # ID: Okay , I have a point about L_C_D_ , # PM: so that means we need an advanced thing . # ID: I dunno if it is the right point to take it up . # ID: W L_C_D_s are basically for feedback , right , to the user who's pressing buttons , and the feedback can come through television itself , so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote ? # ME: Depends how fast your television runs , really , don't you think ? # ME: I mean we've got one of those Telewest boxes and you put the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to the T_V_ and then you wait , and then it comes , so i it actually takes quite a long time . # ME: And if you get the number in wrong , then it's a bit of a pain , so I think , you know , a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that . # ME: But like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit . # PM: It it is also quite nice though to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen , # PM: so if you're watching something # ID: That's true , that's also # ME: And i it would be like I mean if you could make it integrate with the T_V_ then it could come up with new information about what's on , and you could just see that on the remote rather than # PM: Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure . # ME: But I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone , you know , like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched . # ME: So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control , you know or like a minimalist remote control . # ME: So you got your buttons one to nine , your on and off and your volume on that # ME: and then if you want to mess about with it , you flip it open and , # PM: And then you can flip it open . # ID: So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go because of style and # ME: so that kind of decides your whole chip thing . # ID: You you agree ? Maarika , ? # ID: So L_C_D_s , definitely . # ME: Okay , apparently , fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration . # ME: I discovered clip art . # ME: so these will be an important feature for clothes , shoes and furniture . # ME: So I mean , I'm taking this to mean , you know , curviness . # ME: 'Cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables . You know ? # PM: and possibly even uneven , # ME: bit of asymmetry and stuff . # PM: like not symmet # ME: But that would be a good way to get in the whole R_S_I_ issue in there , because I mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands so you wanna you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand . # ME: , I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy . # PM: Something a bit squishy and # ME: but I mean y you have to # UI: So it could be like a rubbery # ID: we have rubber , but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the with using # ME: Well I suppose you wouldn't get a remote an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber . # PM: and it'd help if you drop it , it protects it as well . # PM: To some degree . # ID: So if we use latex cases , they won't allow us to use solar cells , as an energy source that is the constraint , so we could use titanium , wood or plastic or # PM: Or if we want to use the latex , then we have to go with one of the other power things . # ID: w energy source . # ME: If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there , # PM: From from bouncing it . # ME: you could just bounce it up and down . # ID: , tap it on the desk , . # PM: You can have it as like a little ball to bounce , that flips open . # ID: So probably double curved surface is the way to go , Or or curved at one end and flat on the top , because I I'm not sure if it is flat on both the sides , then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons , etcetera . # ME: You have to have a certain element of flatness , I think . # ME: It it depends on the whole ergonomics of it , you know , it's like how you put your hands so y it's the least movement basically . # ID: singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much , does it ? # ME: I d I don't think it makes a lot of difference . # ME: I have one of those s slidey phones and I mean the back is essentially straight , but it's curvy , so . # ME: Besides , you have four sides to a thing , so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight and , you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing ? # ID: Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff because according to the information that I have , I think the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three . # ID: eith either we have a flat surfaced case or a curved surfaced case . # ID: It does not say anything about whether technically , you know , this stuff is available at all . # PM: Nothing to open them . # ME: it's more about the protecting the L_C_D_ , which I think is where it came from . # ME: But no , my research didn't tell me anything , which is why we have all the pictures , 'cause I had nothing better to do with my time . # PM: Anything else ? # PM: What've we got ? # ME: combine style with a level of functionality , beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and p function . # PM: Looking at what we've got , we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel . # ID: Let's let's try to r rub off things and # PM: rub off some of those . # ID: hand dynamos are definitely out , right ? # ID: You you got a wind dynamo , . # PM: it's not that's not streamlined and sexy , having a having a wind up . # ID: kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh appeal , # ME: It's about the practicality of it really , isn't it ? You know ? # ID: As against a watch , which constantly keeps moving , # ID: this thing will have to be tapped every time , which might be very frustrating for the user . # PM: Depends how much how much movement it really needs . # ID: Kinetic energy it needs I don't have too much technical information on that , # PM: Pr presumably if they're suggesting it , then we could use it . # ID: Okay , let's keep it option keep an option , # ID: the flat co completely flat case is definitely out , right ? # ID: It has to be at least curved from one side , . # PM: We don't want that it's no it's not vegetable . # ID: we still have all the options . # ID: Wood , do you think wood will be a good idea ? # UI: N wood is I can't n how do you I mean you can't keep it really small you can't make it like thin and # ME: I can't imagine a m wooden remote control . # UI: The wood thing . # UI: Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in , so I mean if the case you add the case and it becomes a bit bulky # ID: if it is really thin if it is really thin it it's likely to break , # ID: it's much more # PM: and given that we're looking at more spongy material preferences , I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more # UI: U wood is not really . # ME: Well it's not very cleanable either , # ME: It's it's not a practical I mean it's alright for a table , but for a remote control , you know . # ME: And splinters and stuff and # ID: okay wood is out . # ME: It just m doesn't make any sense , I think is the thing with wood . # UI: in the case of remote control not really . # ID: Okay , now for the really interesting stuff , the interface . # ID: Right , so the push-buttons is our expertise in the industry , but it seems to be out of trend , you know , nobody seems to be # ME: You have to have some push-buttons , don't you ? # UI: I think for the channel numb channel numbers you still need them , wouldn't you ? # UI: , so for channel numbers but # ID: Oh , if we have L_C_D_ displays , that opens up a whole world , you know , if you have an L_C_D_ display , then mm you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display . # UI: But I th but I think the L_C_D_ display is kind of , it's faster # PM: Just for fast # UI: with a m and w if we dis and when we s discussed that we might like this flipping open thing , then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control , but if you do want to use L_C_D_ , then you flip it open , but it's it it's more time-consuming . # ME: I think this is going back to the graph at the beginning that I made , where , you know , the buttons that people use all the time , you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven . # ID: So in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options . # ID: Do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine ? # ID: Or do we have just channel plus , channel minus , just to just to scroll ? # UI: I mean mm we definitely need the numbers , # UI: because it's otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels . # PM: Do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as L_C_D_ ? # ID: on the L_C_D_ we can , you know # UI: I would say buttons , # ME: I would think buttons , # ME: It's it's the I think the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote , and then if someone wants to , you know , change the contrast on their T_V_ and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible , # ME: but , you know , I mean most of the time I mean there's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the T_V_ , I think is the issue there . # ID: Okay , so buttons definitely in but oh shall we try to draw a prec # PM: I think that's what you guys are gonna do next , so if we put down the key things that we want . # ID: Okay , okay , so the components . # ID: Right , so what about the scrolling ? # UI: but n I I'm not completely clear I , about the spinning wheel . # UI: So I think it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing , # UI: can al include everything in the spinning if you # PM: Just spinning and not scrolling , I would say . # ME: I would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel , # ME: so you have to decide whether you know , you want to be going so fast or not . # ME: But I mean the thing with this whole if y you're planning on making it out of rubber , on the basis that it's spongy , then I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work . # PM: But if you've got a if you've got a flipped thing , effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side , but you folded it in half . # UI: , but I mean you can # ME: but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side . # PM: Th that would be on one side , uh-huh . # ID: I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber . # PM: No , I think it's just the casing rubber on the outside . # UI: , I think so too , I mean the case would be # ME: You want an outside of rubber # UI: the case would be rubber and the buttons , # ME: then open it up and # ID: Or or at the corners , edges , just the edges covered by rubber or something like that . # UI: rubber buttons , but then # ID: Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it . # ME: Or maybe like interchangeable cases . # ME: 'Cause I know like we're going back to iPods again n the whole spinning wheel , but I have like a you know , obviously my iPod's not made of rubber , but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it # ME: and I can change the colour , theoretically , to match my outfit . # ID: okay , so that gives us a more trendy look as well . # ME: I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now . # ID: , and we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway , right ? # PM: That's right , that's what they're after . # ID: I'll rub that out . # ID: And colours can be provided with the case rather than but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such , you know , just keep it black , or # UI: I think we it was a requirement that we use our th the colours of our company , so would it be like yellow , grey and black or something , or # ME: That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though . # UI: Banana's yellow , definitely . # ME: but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours , do you know ? # ME: So you could have like I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and maybe purple and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to match with it . # ID: okay , if you g go over to the integrated circuits . # ID: since we're having L_C_D_s there there's no way that we're will be able to # PM: We need the advanced . # ID: what we do need to consider , however , is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering , but since L_C_D_s seems to be a definite yes , so it seems to be one area where we would want to spend . # ID: So I'll rub off the other two . # ME: So are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or # ID: oh the constraint was # PM: We can't have solar panels with rubber , so . # ME: solar panels with the rubber . # ME: , okay , so we lose that I think . # PM: Shall we go for if we're going for rubber , we think on as our case , and then # UI: And the buttons as well , I think . # PM: We've got five more minutes . # ID: we'll have using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , I mean , a although it does seem interesting . # ID: But it does not hold any advantages as such for a # ME: It's just a gimmick . # ID: okay , so r we understand this better now that the speaker is for the feedback , right ? # ID: It it says the things that you type in or something like that , so # PM: I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then I'd put them in , # ID: we don't have too much information about it , # UI: , but it I think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company , . # PM: It's from the company , so # ID: so th this is in as well then , the sample speaker . # PM: And the case is curved on one side , but then flat , so it's flipped into each other . # ID: Flat on the top . # PM: Can I pull the thing out the back of your computer ? # PM: Just so we can # ME: do you want me to # PM: Nothing , it's right , I'm just There we go . # ME: What does I_C_S_ mean ? # ID: integrated circuits . # ME: So it's advanced integrated circuits ? # PM: oh now I've gone too far . # ID: we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s , mm . # PM: We're on our way . # PM: So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery , the advanced chip and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , made out of rubber and the buttons are also rubber . # PM: We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel , and we're incorporating voice recognition . # PM: That's our overall concept , and it's gonna look sort of vegetable , and be in bright vegetable colours . # UI: So w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_ , or would it be on the outer # ME: Imagine it would be inside . # PM: I think it's on the # ME: So actually that could like really cut down your thing , so you've got your outside , which is like minimalist , and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into . # ME: so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the You've maybe got , you know like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel , and four of the buttons are in the wheel , and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel , # PM: In the centre , Okay , so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting . # PM: In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design , which I'll presume he'll work out what that means . # PM: the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation . # PM: And as well as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach . # PM: Is that all okay ? # PM: And anyone who hasn't put their presentation in the project documents folder , it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it . # ME: I'm gonna go and sit on my own . # PM: Y nobody wants to talk to you . # ME: I know , I'm hated . # PM: Unplug yourself . # ME: I've got a bit tangled up in all this # UI: So but shall I move away first or shall I stay here with # PM: I dunno , maybe I would car
# ID: I'm proud of it . # PM: This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . # PM: And again I'll take minutes . # PM: what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . # ME: It does look very cool . # PM: then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . # PM: Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . # PM: and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . # PM: and then we will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . # PM: So we've got forty minutes . S # ME: And then do we get to make a remote control ? # PM: 'Cause we missed out . # PM: it's now I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four fifteen . # ID: How how much do we have , forty minutes ? # PM: Is that right ? # UI: , about four fifteen , . # PM: until about four fifteen . # UI: So , you said are we starting with the # ID: Presentation . # UI: so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and then I will explain the user interface th things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and # ID: Okay . So basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana . # ME: You think bananas are a safe thing to use ? # ME: It's a bit phallic . # UI: Well , but it's just an a approximation . # PM: Dual use , perfect . # PM: Dual use , perfect . # ME: your remote control ? Oh that's just bad . # PM: Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ? # ID: so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again . # ID: So now we have the okay , so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . # ID: And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . # ID: And we have the user interface o in here and the L_C_D_ and the scroll are inside . # ID: well , everything else is probably user interface , so . # PM: And it's the whole thing's made of rubber , is that # ME: Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ? # UI: it could be made a bit smaller , and of course it would be and , but one thing we actually kind of forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , so we said the back side round , . # ID: well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . I think it's # ME: It l does look like the curvy and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable . # UI: And it's spongy as well . # ME: I wasn't very keen on that , but . # UI: So so the user interface as we discussed last time mm on the on the cover we just have the very basic things . # UI: So we have that n channels here starting from one two three there would be numbers in the on the actual one . # UI: So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here . # PM: Six seven eight nine . # UI: And then , well this is on off button . # UI: It's it's quite standard mm place for it and also the colour is quite often red , so it's kind of user friendly . # UI: And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one . # UI: And and we would also have a l little thing saying here , previous and ne prevon next . # ME: So where's the volume ? # UI: The volume is scrolling . # ID: It's on the side . # ME: you did get that in then , # UI: you just do it like this . # UI: And and it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here . # UI: So the volume is you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , okay , there you have the screen and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose . # UI: You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen mm the middle button . # ME: Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button . # ID: no , we we'd not put # UI: A mute button . # ID: so on the cover we have the bare essentials . # UI: Well , we'll have this on the screen , on the display . # PM: Y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you # ME: On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute . # ID: on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options . # UI: Well , but the but the mute , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ? # PM: But if you hold it in , # ME: , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ? # PM: if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ? # ME: So that solves the whole mute issue . # UI: And okay , so i so the voice recognition is also just part of it . # UI: You can't really see it in the interface . # ID: , it's hidden in there somewhere . # UI: And we do have the logo on it as well . # PM: And it's with the black and yellow you're even in the right colours . # UI: , I think we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website . # ID: We ran out of resources here , so . # UI: In the actual one . # ID: You can have a look . # UI: So if you have questions . # PM: Very good , let's have a look . # PM: it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess . # ME: , oh , we hold the remote . # ME: Oh , but it does feel all cold and slimy . # ME: I hate Play-Do , it's just minging . # ME: But , that's cool , cool . # PM: Okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria and then we'll there # ID: , see the budget . # PM: I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow . # PM: We'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country and cut some of the prices that way . # PM: Wales , for example . # ME: Mm . Cool , okay . Right , okay . # PM: Marketing Expert . # ME: So what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design . # ME: so we're gonna be using a seven point scale , so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . # ME: , you know . Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them . # ME: you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that . # ME: so these are what they are . # PM: So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . # PM: Is that right ? # ME: I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . # PM: Mm dots , never mind . # ME: Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good . # ID: I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything . # UI: it's definitely attractive . # UI: Oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot . # ME: Well , I thought we'd kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ? # PM: , just prepare one now . # UI: Shall I just prepare it now ? # UI: It will be red , too . # ME: So , be attractive to look at . # ME: That's this one . # ME: What do you all say ? # UI: S seven was th the maximum , ? # UI: I go for seven . # ME: Oh we're all so proud of the . # PM: it's terribly sexy . # ME: Okay , so that'll be a seven for A_ . # ME: oh no , you can't whilst that's up there . # ME: Okay what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in . # PM: Except we can't # ID: But we can we can # ME: But that's alright . # ID: I can I can take note uh # ME: If you take a note of them , and then I'll put them in a minute . # PM: then , I'll take a note , it's fine . # ME: Okay , so we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ? # ME: Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? # ID: the only thing that we were considering was that this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , # PM: I think it does . # UI: I would think yes , . # ID: so if you're left-handed you're kind of left scrolling with your finger . # UI: so y so we might do we might want to do like a another m model another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . # PM: But that's gonna be a problem , # PM: 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family . # ID: So bu it's not a huge problem , # ME: I th I think it's not it's not like it's a pen . # ID: because i it is operatable . # UI: But then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , so they just # ME: , but I mean because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , but they can normally do most things right-handed , so I would say it's not such a big issue . # UI: because I mean anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , # ME: I mean you can you can use your finger to scroll rather than your thumb . # UI: so i if the majority are right-handed , it's # ME: So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue . # ME: So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ? # ME: What do you what do you all think ? # UI: Or maybe six , because it's just one i one among the issues , # PM: I think I think for I mean most people are right-handed , so in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want might want to # ID: One more thing is that i It might be a little clumsy when it opens up , right , so it opens on the side . So # UI: No , but mm but we have it nicely with the hinges here . # UI: So it won't be a problem , # ID: So you guys can decide wh whether # UI: it will be and it will be it won't be heavy . # ME: I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top . # ID: , but we which makes it kind of really big , . # PM: The length is gonna be difficu # UI: but it's a bit long . # UI: It's a little bit long . # UI: Well , I mean it can be opened like this of course and . # ME: But you were thinking about making it smaller , ? # ID: this kind of makes it more # UI: S slightly smaller . # ID: and two , it might interfere with the I_R_ channel . # ME: So you have to keep that side flat . # UI: , but if we flip it open only as much as that . # ME: So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work . # ME: Okay . okay , Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ? # ID: we have a locator . # PM: we're gonna put it like we've got th there's the locator dot . # ME: There's a locator . # ME: so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , # UI: Mm that you stick on T_V_ . # ME: To make it beep . # UI: but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it has some capacity to mm to do some to make some sounds , so . # ME: So that's two , so that's seven , . # ME: It's locatable ? # ID: Intuitive , completely intuitive . # UI: If uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's I th I think it's # PM: I'd say six , 'cause the I mean the standard layout for numbers is three and one , rather than the way you've got it . # PM: I really like the way you have it , but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to . # ID: And even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology so m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni # ID: so it is kind of not very intuitive but it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it . # PM: But it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon . # ME: So , should we maybe say f a five and say it is intuitive , but it's different , so , do you know , I mean it's obvious how to use it , but you might have to think about it first . # ME: So we give that one a five , you think ? # ID: I'm gonna give a seven in everything , so . # PM: I'm happy with five ? # ME: I'm glad you're accepting this . # ME: It has taken a little while , hasn't it ? # ME: intuitive but it's really hard to write on those . # ME: I just went a bit mad , didn't I ? # ME: okay , cool , I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed . Investigate . # PM: But otherwise it's superb . # ME: So , should we give it a six ? # UI: the ergonom ergonomic design well mm I mean I d I dunno , I mean the repetitive stress things , but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , # ID: unless you are a all the time sitting . # ID: , I think it is ergonomic . # ME: I used to send fifty texts a day , you know , # PM: Well we've banned them from # ME: and I never got repetitive strain injury from that , so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest . # ID: And moreover it has L_C_D_ and everything , so that you know we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway . # ME: Okay , so we give that a six , # PM: Voice control have # ME: Hang on , how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? # PM: , that's the second one . # PM: So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide . # ID: So it has voice control . # ME: so that's a seven then . # PM: G_ technologically innovative . # UI: Technologi well # ID: it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen . # PM: But in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new . # UI: Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is , it's kind of new . # ME: , but I mean you don't # PM: All of the components have been used in other things before . # ID: , but they've been brought together in a remote . # UI: But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new . # ME: They're never been used i they've never been using remote control before I don't think . # PM: What do you reckon , five , six ? # ME: what do you all think ? # UI: I mean how far can you go with a remote control , really ? # ME: Well , that's it , I mean # UI: It still has to do what i what it has to do . # ME: , but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ? # ME: So , I don't think many peop # PM: Space remote . # ME: That's it , they can take it with them . # PM: Put fashion in electronics . # UI: , isn't it fashionable ? # ID: The carrot banana remote . # UI: It's the maximum fashion . # ME: So , we give it seven , and we write # UI: Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so . # ID: I think that's a . # UI: So I think we've done very well , # UI: What's the assessment ? # ME: So , we need the average here , so we got # UI: The average is about six and something . # UI: A little bit over six . # ID: There are how many sixes ? # ID: One , two , three . # ME: So we've got four sevens , # UI: No , wait , a little bit under six . # ME: so that's twenty eight , # UI: Oh , three sixes , okay , . # PM: Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . # ID: Okay , twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six . Forty six and five , fifty one . # ID: Fifty one divided by # UI: Six point something , . # ME: Two three four Seven eight . # PM: about six point five . # UI: Six point five , . # PM: Close enough . # ME: that's pretty good , I think . # PM: Now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it . # PM: That's all you've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ? # PM: And we'll see if we can unscrew this first . # ME: Cool , there we go . # PM: this is I'm just # ME: There we go and there are the marks . # PM: Computer no signal ? # ID: Mm I guess it'll have to wait for a bit . # PM: so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria . # PM: And now we have to calculate the production costs . # PM: So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that . # PM: Can you read that ? # PM: I started filling it in , but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down . # PM: No hand dynamo , right ? # PM: One simple battery . # PM: No kinetic energy , no solar . # PM: The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print . # PM: We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker . # PM: single-curved surface , so that we can fold it . # PM: Case material we said rubber . # PM: I don't know what special colour means . # ID: Mm anything I think which is not more . # UI: I think something coloured , probably . # UI: So I think this is probably special co no ? # ME: but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know . # PM: Rub rubber comes coloured , it's I would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different . # UI: Or maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , # PM: let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy . # ME: you might end up having to take off the sample sensor . # PM: We we're definitely going to have to # UI: We have pushbuttons , # PM: so we've got pushbutton , and then we've # UI: scro we have scroll wheel as well . # PM: Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? # UI: we had , for muting , . # UI: And we have L_C_ display # PM: And button supplements . # ID: We don't have we're not using any of that . # UI: , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but the wh but the s spinning wheel # PM: But the spinning wheel's not there . # PM: I have think maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display ? # ME: We've got more than one pushbutton though , # PM: I think the pushbutton # ME: 'Cause then you have # PM: I don't know if that's one # ME: That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? # ME: Not counting anything , we'd still be in budget . # PM: That seems unlikely . # ID: Wh wh what is the limit ? . # ME: Twelve point five . # PM: whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we # UI: We have to count all of them , # ID: Mm I don't think so , no . # PM: I don't think that makes sense . # ID: No it says what is the kind of interface , # ME: Well it doesn't , but it # ID: if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display , # ME: And L_C_ display . # ID: so that's the three kind of interfaces that we have . # PM: So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here . # ID: Wh wh what's our criteria ? # ME: This sample sensor . # PM: Our budget's twelve point five . # ME: , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there . # PM: so that has implications though for the . # ID: it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker . # ID: when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello . # PM: For the locator . # ME: But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ? # ID: Mm and the locator also goes away . # ME: We can afford to get rid of it . # UI: But it was very no innovative # ME: So that means no locator , does it ? # UI: innovativeness . Well . # PM: What else does it need ? # UI: Well the speaker the sample speaker is expensive , but we could just have some very easy device that just beeps . # PM: 'cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing . # UI: This would be there you record your samples your speech samples and # ID: A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber . # PM: Right , so we need one fifty off . # ME: See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , # PM: Take it down to just a scroll wheel . # ID: So tha that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make a selection in the L_C_D_ ? # UI: , then we would be in the b budget . # ID: in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? # ID: But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button . # UI: you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing . # ME: But that's well you would just have to spin it down . # PM: You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for mute . # ME: So that's point three . # ID: it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing . # UI: But I mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well . # ME: I mean that wouldn't actually cost any more . # ME: That's the spin wheel though , isn't it ? # ME: Didn't that come with the L_C_ # PM: That's with the L_C_ # ID: That comes with the L_C_D_ ? # PM: We decided , 'cause it's not on our list . # ID: Oh so the this is # PM: The scroll wheel is on the side . # ID: we're adding costs for right , okay I mean I think this is good . # ME: S so we're point three over . # PM: We're point three over at the moment . # ME: Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether # PM: It's nothing n # ME: and just have pushbuttons for the volume . # ME: Could b still put them on the side . # ME: I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool , but # ID: Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down . # ID: Mm it sounds good actually , . # PM: Rather than having three different things that people have to do . # PM: Oh look , we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses . # ME: , well we could admit to the single curve , couldn't we ? # PM: Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour . # PM: So that's alright . # PM: We we'll leave it at that and then I'll take I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it , # PM: So did we lose on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ? # ID: Not really , no . # ME: No , I don't think so . # ID: Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display . # ID: instead of having scrolling we just push the buttons . # ME: We just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway , and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was it's not a great difference I don't think . # ID: But we lose the locator . # PM: Alright then . # PM: We're gonna have a beep . # UI: Well we're going to have a beeping thing . # ID: So instead of speaker , . # UI: But , it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate . # ME: That's not a very exciting colour . # ME: I think you should make it more vegetable-like . # UI: Which colour , the colour of the phone or the colour of the # ME: Oh the beeper thing . # UI: But it can be yellow as well . # UI: It can come in the same colour as the case . # PM: 'Cause we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh . # ME: , I think Jen wants it to vibrate . # PM: , I know I know , my pen vibrates . # ME: You know , your pen vibrates ? # PM: But only for a very short time . # PM: looks like we've designed a banana . # PM: Well done , team . # PM: we need we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product . # UI: as far as creativity is concerned , I think there was there was room for creativity . # UI: The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the budget we had . # ID: I think n one thing that was lacking was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . # ID: we kap kept a adding things randomly . # ID: So , had we known # ME: If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can . # ID: So d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented . # PM: But in terms of the process of going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that worked in terms of . # ME: I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know . # ME: It wasn't like we were alone for very long , so you didn't st go off and think , wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana , # ME: and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana . # UI: , the m the means were very good , the means we used . # PM: the whiteboard digital pens . # ME: I like the pens . # PM: We like the pens . # ME: That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s # PM: you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down and have it printed out when you got back to the office . # ID: I wonder what one of these costs . # PM: Do you think they'd notice if one went ? # ME: I don't think you should say that was the recording . # ME: Okay , cover up the microphone . # ME: Alright , let's take it . # PM: But that worked well having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , 'cause the I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there , # ME: It is a bit limiting , isn't it ? # UI: , and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the # ME: The thing flew in , you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , 'cause there wasn't time for that , so . # PM: That's alright , that always irritates me anyway , . # ME: Not that you can do that on the board , either . # ME: We could make some little # UI: But , but I mean already just preparing the slides before the meeting , . # ME: , totally , I mean that was fairly tight anyway , I mean especially with that last-minute alteration . # ME: back it , this is just had to be changed . And , so cool . # ME: Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ? # PM: And presumably you don't you can say nasty things as well . # PM: I have no stake in it . # UI: I was I was satisfied with the leadership , . # ME: You weren't like a dictating leader , so that was always good . # PM: You have to say that , 'cause I'm taking the notes . # PM: I'll leave the room and you can have another go . # ME: I know you've got the pen , you might attack me with it . # PM: Better than that than the banana . # UI: And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite nicely , . # PM: I think it worked quite well . # PM: Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ? # UI: To express them mm # ID: Mm . I guess it was a fairly small group , so all of us got to express our opinions , . # PM: New ideas found . # PM: Not quite sure what about . # UI: Well it's pretty new , pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and # ME: I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it . # UI: , neither do I , but I've never seen anything and none of my examples were was like this , actually , so . # ME: I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay . # ME: That looks boring , I'll see if anyone's made a remote control . # UI: maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one . # UI: Patent patent . Mm . # ME: I think we'd like to think the ideas were new , # PM: Banana remote . # ME: but we've got no way of finding out . # PM: Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control . # ME: That vibrates # PM: Flip . Vibrate # ME: , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it . # PM: Nothing that you really want . # PM: Okay . So , costs are within budget , well within budget , including a little what have we got ? # PM: One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . # PM: we've evaluated the project . # ME: And it's fabulous . # PM: You've got the scores . # PM: Can you put that in the project documents file ? # ME: It's in the project documents . # PM: It's in there already . # PM: And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . # PM: Were there any was there anything that you found difficult , or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ? # UI: And my main difficulty was the time pressure . # UI: Otherwise it's all fine . # ME: sometimes it's like a little bit rushed . # ID: I thought that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and . # ID: Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute . # PM: I think we're still well within our time . # ME: we've got like five minutes left . # PM: We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . # PM: We're just too efficient # ID: We certainly are , # PM: and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time . # PM: So I would say that's the end of that meeting . # PM: Thank you , team . # UI: , it was a pleasure working with you . # PM: It was very productive day and # ME: We could draw animals on the board again . # ID: I don't think so . # UI: You can make some animals . # ME: I don't like Play-Doh , no . # UI: Oh , you don't like anim # ME: It's just minging . # ME: It smells so bad . # UI: Smells quite nice . # UI: Smells very sweet . # PM: Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it . # ID: Was there a questionnaire already sent ? # PM: I don't know if it's already sent or not . # ME: No , it hasn't been . # PM: presumably I have to # ME: Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ? # PM: I don't see why you can't stay here , really . # ME: Okay , so the other way . # PM: Did I save this one ? # PM: Production costs . # UI: I made your animal for you . # PM: It was supposed to be pink . # PM: But it was blue on the board . # UI: , that's the one .
# ID: So we're 'kay ? On the or No . I dunno where to put it 'cause the Could you s take it off ? . # ME: Is that alright ? # ME: Keeps coming off . # PM: How do we sta wa how do we start ? # PM: Does anybody know ? # ME: Oh , another one . # PM: So that's this Oh okay , right . # ID: Are we free to take notes # PM: Okay , just hang on a second everybody . # PM: I haven't actually looked at this yet . # PM: I haven't looked at it , but let's just start it off and we'll see what happens . # PM: If you're all ready . # PM: So is the agenda ? # PM: Opening , acquaintance , tool training and project plan , discussion and then closing . # PM: Project aim is a new remote control . # PM: It's original , trendy and it's user-friendly . # PM: Project method , functional design , individual work , another meeting , conceptual design , individual work , and a meeting of details design , individual work and a meeting . # PM: Tool training . # PM: Try out the whiteboard , every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal . # PM: Miss Industrial Designer , would you like to go first ? # ID: So are we supposed to bring the little things for the # PM: why don't you just c , I think just clip on clip do you have a belt ? # PM: Or put 'em in your pocket , . # ID: okay . So my favourite animal # PM: what's your favourite animal ? # ME: It's an elephant . # PM: That's a very good elephant . # UI: The back end of an elephant . # ME: Oh my gosh , I'm never gonna be able to draw that well . # PM: 'Kay , and you want to write up on there , it says you've gotta sum up your f your favourite characteristics of that animal . # ID: it's big , it's got a great memory . # ID: Supposed to have a great memory , we say an elephant never forgets . # ID: And dunno know why but looks like nice to me . # PM: Okay . Wonderful , well done . # PM: Do you want to use the wipe the m the wiper and wipe it off ? # PM: And Mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next ? # UI: Aesthetic yep , sure . # ME: I have no idea what my favourite animal is . # UI: 'Kay , my favourite animal , let's see . # UI: Dunno if any of you have seen Napoleon Dynamite before . # UI: It's a liger , a combination of a lion and tiger . # UI: Have you not seen Napoleon Dynamite ? # UI: Oh it's a hilarious movie . # UI: You have to see it . # UI: and it's best characteristic is it's pretty much the awesomest animal . # UI: But you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it . # PM: Okay , well done . # PM: . Miss mar Miss Marketing ? # ME: Not quite sure how this is gonna work . # ME: well I'll try my best to draw . # ME: Can I just draw the face ? # PM: , I think you can just draw the face , but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks . # PM: That's a very pr pretty cat . # ME: Which also has what ? A big fat body and big and a long tail . # PM: do y do you wanna do some write you wanna just write some words about it ? # ME: Because cuddly . # ME: And usually cats are very friendly . # ME: And they're healing as well . # ME: And they can feel when a human's got problems so # PM: Wow , so they're kinda spiritual . # ME: So , that's why I like cats . # ME: There we are , that's me . # PM: , I don't actually have a favourite animal , but for the for th for this meeting I'll s draw a little I honestly can't draw for toffee . # UI: A prairie dog ? # UI: Oh a squirrel ? # PM: That's exactly what it is . # PM: not a very good one # ID: Not bad I would say . # UI: , that's pretty good . # PM: Okay , well , you got it's a s It's a squirrel , and I like them , because they're cute and stupid . # PM: Right . Okay , so , I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working . # PM: Mm . Let's move on to the next page . # PM: Okay , project finance , selling price twenty five Euros , profit aim fifty million Euros . # ME: Market range internationally sold . # PM: Production cost , it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make . # PM: experience with remote control , so talk about who who's used what . Any ideas ? # PM: Stuff like that . # PM: Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . # PM: At quarter to twelve . # UI: So I think before we close , we are expected I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where . # UI: I mean if you wanna go back to the last slide . # UI: , I think we're I mean before we close the meeting , we're supposed to come up with some ideas for # PM: Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or oh okay . # PM: I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next , but # UI: , I think this is just the preliminary , get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and what we would roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe . # PM: Right , who's got experiences with remote controls then ? # PM: Pretty much everybody . # UI: , I think we've all got # ID: Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make ? # ME: it's a T_V_ remote control . # ME: A new remote control for T_V_ . # ME: What would I like ? . # PM: You want it big do you want it small . # PM: Are we are we going for like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's big and # UI: it seems like there's like there's sort of a tension between two ideas , I mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work all of the functions of T_V_ and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player , or something like that , # PM: Video and ts hi-fi and stuff . # UI: but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something . # PM: Maybe you now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap . # PM: 'Cause I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices , but that would p that would probably be quite expensive . # ID: But how do we know how much , I mean , how much do we have per how much ? # ME: Twelve fifty . # ID: Twelve fifty . # UI: It g can't be more than twelve fifty per unit . # ID: So do we have to be realistic within the budget or # PM: Well at the moment we could , wa I mean we # ID: Close pr I don't know how much it would cost . # PM: 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what we'd like , and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not . # PM: So would be nice to have something that controls lots of different things . # ME: Couldn't we have like one that comes out ? # ME: Like so you have one in like mm it doesn't have to be really thick . # ME: I mean remote controls can be thin bits . # ME: And then you have one for your D_V_D_ and you sort of slide it out , and then you have another one , you slide it out . # ME: And then it all comes compact into one . # ME: So it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and into one basically . # PM: Th that's an idea . # ME: So you just flip them out . # ID: have one very complicated one on one side with all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff , and then on the other side o one a remote control that would be very simple with just the channel , program plus and minus , and the just the mute button , for example . # ID: I can real keep it really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated . # PM: One side for kids , one side for adults . # UI: I'm not sure if that's like # ID: Or grandma as well , you know it's like what is the mute button . # UI: I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it . # ID: No , but you would slide it into someth like something on the back would hold like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons , but # PM: or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe . # ME: That would be cool . # PM: F flip it open and you've got all the buttons , or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe . # ME: I was thinking that like a flip . # PM: , oh we've got five minutes left . # ID: Start breaking up . # PM: Well we've got a k we've got a few ideas there . # UI: we should I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a rough conception you know stage one was technical functions design , what effect the apparatus should have . # UI: Okay . so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate D_V_D_ players , things like that . # PM: I have got I think we should also have a back-up plan of I 'cause I just think that it might be expensive to make something that I mean we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything . # PM: We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one . # PM: What do you reckon ? # PM: See 'cause , I'm just thinking bearing in mind th we've gotta we have to have something that's cheap to make . # UI: , that's true , maybe we should just concentrate on having a good T_V_ remote , and have it be # PM: I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker . # UI: have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use , simple to use , and looks decent and # PM: May w you know , maybe even # ME: But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ? # PM: Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people # ME: I mean if it's if it's just like # PM: or so people that b don't see very well or big buttons for touchy buttons for # UI: Sorta find a niche for our remote , like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people , # PM: Or just one that looks really fucking cool . # UI: certain demographic # ID: Could be really light or , I dunno , something special . # UI: , no I think you're right . # UI: rathe rather than focus on # PM: Otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about do this let's do that n I think we sh I think we should # ID: 'cause at the end of the day if it says just T_V_ remote , doesn't say com combination with all the r # PM: I mean obviously everyone we're you know sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once , but you know , that's # UI: Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside . # PM: I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well , but that's not gonna happen . # ME: I think a flip up thing , 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this well I did anyway , like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach , and you'd come and sit down and ooh , the telephone's the television switched on or something . # ME: So maybe something that like does have a lid or closes , so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something . # PM: like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , # ME: But make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it . # PM: , it's gotta be sellable . # UI: , that's true what you were saying , I mean it doesn't have to have a flip function , it can just have a lock function , so that it's not usable when you don't want it to be usable . # ME: And even for kids as well . # ME: It's it's safer for them , I guess . # ME: Like they don't flick onto channels and all that sl flick onto . # PM: No porn channel for children . # PM: Okay . alright , so we've got some ideas , we've got # UI: I guess that's good for now . # PM: Oops , let's close that . # PM: Next meeting , okay . # ME: W What does I_D_V_I_D_N_M_E_ stand for ? # PM: Industrial Designer which is # ME: these are requirement specification . # ME: And I'm marketing . # PM: User Interface Designer , that's # PM: that's you , so you gotta you go , you're gonna be the one that's working out what buttons we need . # PM: Industrial Designer , you are the one , you know , you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in , I guess so , whether it's what goes into the box , somehow . # ID: Mm . Har how it works an # PM: And in marketing # ME: These are requirement specification . # PM: User requirements specifications . # ME: So what the user requires # ID: Do you think our two kind of overlap , because # UI: , it does seem like our responsibilities have some overlap . # ME: I guess that's what it says . # PM: You two you two are gonna be just , I think , you just double up , you know , you working together . # PM: You're the one that's gotta go and find out do th do the research , see what people want in a remote , what buttons are used more often , and s stuff like that . # PM: Oh , we've been warned to finish the meeting now . # PM: Okay everyone , well done . # PM: Good meeting . # UI: Alright , see you in thirty minutes . # ME: So , do we take these off ? .
# PM: Think we can first # UI: Right it was function F_ eight or something . # UI: This one right there . # ID: Who is gonna do a PowerPoint presentation ? # ID: You will as well ? # UI: Oh I thought we all were . # UI: , I have one too , okay . # UI: Whoops I forgot to put the thing on # PM: Right . I just wanna 'cause basically I can't re I've really crap at remembering everyone's name so I just wanna rather than going Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that wanted to know your names again . # PM: just gonna leave this up here 'cause I'll you know . So # UI: Sure , that's a good idea . # ID: I'm Catherine with a C_ . # PM: And you're s r R_E_I_S_S_ # PM: 'S just a bit nicer calling people by their names I think . # PM: Okay , right , welcome to meeting B_ . # PM: this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , basically , 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now . # PM: I am your Project Manager , and , I'm just here to sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going , get people talking and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically . # PM: right , this for the purposes of this meeting what this meeting is all about is I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , what you've been working on for the last wee while , when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and , you know , filling out silly questionnaires and things . # PM: But hopefully you've been actually been doing something productive . # PM: So we're gonna each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation . # PM: Then we're gonna work , you know , from each of your presentations . # PM: We'll we'll talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . # PM: and then we'll , we'll sort of conclude anything else comes up at the end of it . # ID: How long is the meeting ? # PM: This meeting it's not very long . It's probably down to about thirty five minutes now . # PM: So I want each of your presentations to not be too long , five minutes , something like that . # PM: if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy , it doesn't matter , it just it just says that you it's that's just one particular medium . # PM: If you haven't had time to prepare one , you can draw stuff on the noteboard , you can talk to us , you can you know however you want to do your little presentation , basically , you can . # PM: Don't feel pressurised into using this thing . # PM: You okay over there ? Reissa , # PM: are you b are you joining in with this meeting here or are y or are y or are you are you just are you just doing some Internet shopping there ? # UI: Think she's finishing up her presentation . # ME: D I mean , I I'm finishing off my presentation . # PM: Okay , jolly good . # PM: Alright , let's have well , we all know that it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with . # PM: I think the first thing we should look at is probably the what it is that it is actually supposed to be . # PM: So that's gonna be you Catherine , if we wanna hear from you first . # ID: just connecting this . # PM: You don't have to worry about screwing it in just # ID: Are we getting i Really ? # ID: Okay . So I've got a very quick So the working design , I've got a very quick presentation on this , you can't see a thing . # ID: Oh well , I'm gonna draw it on the board then . # ID: It's in blue , and I couldn't change it . # ID: We it's fine on my screen , but never mind . # ID: So the idea is that we've got the energy source , which in our case will pr , oh well okay , never mind . # ID: So I think maybe two batteries , I dunno what they're called six , or something like that . # ID: and then on the remote control itself will have the sender for the signal , which could be an infra-red signal , which will be sent by an electronic chip . # ID: And the chip will be controlled by the user interface . # ID: So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel . # ID: And the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels . # ID: and that's it really for the working design . # ID: the presentation wasn't very clear but # PM: I prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally . # ID: , should I erase this or # PM: Do you wanna just give us a moment , I just wanna copy this down . # PM: I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this ? # ID: Or suggestions ? # ME: Is a battery like the only way of # ID: Well , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s # UI: , alternate energy source , like win wind power or # PM: , you blow on it and i # UI: Bicycle power . # ME: No I meant like No 'cause like cha 'cause always changing um batteries can get like annoying . # ME: The battery's down and maybe , I dunno , solar charged ? # ID: I dunno , swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but # PM: it's worked for the last fifty years you know . # UI: One question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? # UI: I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream . # PM: How far away is your television ? # PM: It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not doesn't have to go that far , # ID: Well , the thing is you don't # PM: Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall . # ME: , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the put the telephone down , and go into the other room . # ID: Well , we can make the signal strong enough to go through walls if you fancy it . # ID: I didn't think about that # ME: How about Bluetooth ? # ME: Instead of using infra-red , use Bluetooth . # ID: I just think that it's gonna cost more # ME: Isn't that a better signal ? # PM: , I d it sounds like you w don't wanna overcomplicate things . # ID: and I'm not sure it's you're gonna use it . # PM: You know we don't need it . # ID: It's a fancy idea it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room , # ID: you are gonna # PM: Basically , we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit . # PM: We're not w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff . # ID: Oh , we can we can keep the idea if you i We can see at a later stage , maybe , I don't # ME: 'S just an idea . # PM: Right , well done , Catherine . # PM: Gab Gabriel let's hear from you on such things . # ID: Do you need the border ? # UI: I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint . # UI: Technical . Okay . # UI: Okay , so , while this is warming up , # UI: So I'm doing the user interface design . # UI: , and basically , as far as methods , I was I was looking at looking at already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . # UI: Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design . # UI: we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities and does the basics , but so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . # UI: so things that seem like absolute must-haves would be a volume control , so up-down keys for that , channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and a mute button . # UI: one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing some sort of lock function . # UI: , I don't I dunno , that's one possibility . # UI: And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you . # UI: So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , freeze frame . # UI: and this is a user centred one . # UI: it's easier to g just glance at this and see what's possible to do , you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes . # UI: judging from what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , or the direction we were going in at least . # UI: So , the engineering centred ones provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . # UI: and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person , Reissa , because we need to find out what people want before we make firm decisions on this . # PM: Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . # PM: This w research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units stuff . # PM: have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or # UI: No that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . # UI: I mean obviously another exists like you like you said in mobile phones . # UI: That was sort of the inspiration for it . # UI: I've never seen that with in all my years in the remote business . # UI: I've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . # UI: I dunno , what do you guys have a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary ? # PM: I would say it's If it's simple to do , which I think it probably should be , even if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , then yes , it's like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab a flip thing , something like that , but you know being physical . # PM: I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well , something we should take into account is we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . # PM: It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ . # PM: You know , the company it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . # UI: And our motto is we put the fashion in electronics . # PM: We put the fashion in electronics . # UI: I think I think we have to carry that mental . # PM: So it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . # PM: If if remote control well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be . # UI: these , I think , we can so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is the sort of like the ergonomic design . # PM: Because we need # UI: I t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , I mean . # UI: , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh in the market , I guess . # PM: Okay , fantastic . # PM: Right , well done , Gabriel . # PM: Reissa . Let's plug you in , baby . # ME: Where does it go into ? # ME: The blue thing . # UI: , this is getting all . # UI: , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up . # ME: Well , function F_ eight . # PM: , w it just takes a wee while . # UI: , it just takes a second . # ME: Right . Okay . Okay . # ME: Well , for our marketing report we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave so this is research and we also gave participants questionnaires to fill out . # ME: total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . # ME: So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . # ME: Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . # ME: eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . # ME: So I think we all agree with that . # ME: current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . # ME: So , they don't like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . # ME: per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel . # PM: 'Cause we've only got five channels . # ME: That's another thing . # ME: seventy five per cent of users say they zap . # ME: Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like . # PM: I think that's k flicking quickly between channels . # UI: you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess . # ME: takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . # ME: I think especially for the older generation . # ME: I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . # ME: Anyway and they also remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them . # ME: So maybe tracking devices is a good idea . # ME: personal preferences . # PM: You are a child of technology , aren't you ? # ME: I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . # ME: has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . # ME: And it's easy to find , so I don't know whether maybe and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in voice activating . # ME: So voice activation . # ME: So and this was what we came up with . # ME: Then if you look fifteen to twenty five this is age , sorry , age groups . # ME: So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes . # PM: So there you go , . # ME: so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . # ME: And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote . # PM: but do the younger generation have the money ? # PM: They they don't . # UI: No I would I would say the older the older people , . # PM: It's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and # ME: Well the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent say no , so # PM: People people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there . # PM: For people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , they want it . # PM: but no they're not sort of most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , # UI: , that would be my guess as well . # PM: 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years . # PM: d and tha and that's a that's quite a minority there , so , it's not even like fifty that's th thirty five per cent . # ME: These guys are growing up . # UI: What about just from the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? # UI: I mean if it's twelve fifty per unit . # UI: I mean , okay , there's # ME: Voice activation might not be the best . # PM: I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off . # ME: also with buttons , a thing called R_S_I_ , so wrist sense # UI: Repetitive strain rep repetitive strain injury or like from doing # ME: , repetitive strains injury , so they don't I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist . # ID: Well maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then . # ME: I don't think so . # PM: So y so it's so it's so you got so that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of # ME: maybe not so hard . # PM: have a look if there's any w any medical background we can find out about this . # ID: Maybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a # PM: Let's jus we just want need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury . # UI: we should probably consult with our legal department . # PM: They're having a lunch break at the moment , but . # PM: I'll see if I can get see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting . # UI: I think we can do some really in that department , the ergonomic department , we can make some really good improvements . # ME: Maybe th the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much , or we just like flat buttons , something . # PM: That's great , thank you very much for that , Reissa . # PM: okay , so we've basically we've decide we've d we've decided that it's gonna be , you know , we're going for a basic television remote . # PM: It's gotta be safe to use , it's gotta look cool . # PM: It's gotta be cheap . # PM: Now going back to the industrial design of it , you know , we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or Bluetooth . # PM: I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , and that would be infra-red , energy source , that would be batteries . # PM: mean we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . # PM: But a in there's no I don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years , because technology will have changed and , you know , we won't have televisions in ten years' time . # PM: I think we're all pretty sussed on that . # PM: anyone have any questions ? # PM: Everybody happy in their work ? # UI: , it seems like we're all on the pretty much on the same page . # PM: Now this is good , we've got a good structure going on . # PM: We all know where we're going to . # PM: Have you been ge has have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers ? # UI: Oh it's probably just you , 'cause you're the project manager . # ME: Well , just questionnaires . # UI: Sell trying to sell your things . # PM: oh have you guys found out if we can if we can e-mail stuff to each other ? # PM: Do all you all know my e-mail address ? # ID: Well , in the project announcement , you've got the addresses , I think . # ME: I think he's participant one , aren't you ? # ID: So Project Manager , it's participant one at A_M_I_ . # UI: Oh , it's just participant one oh okay . # PM: Can you all d e-mail me your e-mail addresses ? # ID: You have them i you have them , # UI: Well it's just w it's just it's just par participant one , participant two . # ID: but we'll send you an e-mail . # ID: You want to have friends , don't you ? # UI: So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as maybe that's our next meeting that we discuss that . # PM: Is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue ? # PM: I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background , but I might be just going a bit # UI: Well , it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders . # UI: Maybe that's like getting ahead of ourselves . # PM: maybe you can come up with a few with a couple of different ideas ? # ID: It wouldn't be # ME: Can't we have different colours in the remotes , so somebody can choose different col # PM: Well , see the thing is we've gotta keep the company image . # ME: like does it have to be of a certain ? # PM: It's gotta say people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's a Real Reaction i product . # ME: But if it's a R_R_ , it would be Real Reaction , # PM: There's loads of companies that called R_R_ . # ME: like if it had a symbol on it . # PM: This is slog but this is the slogan , this is the type . # UI: And this is something that came on down from the higher ups , so , I mean , we are sort of beholden to them . # ME: So we have to have it one colour . # PM: Well , not necessarily . But we have to incorporate it . # UI: Not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable . # PM: Not necessarily even if i it just has to ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products # ID: Well you could # PM: as opposed to a Sony product or a , you know , a Panasonic product . # PM: It's got to so maybe , so you can have a look at our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps . # ID: It could come But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere like just around the lock button could be the R_R_ logo or colours and # PM: Well this is all your department . # PM: Well , well done everybody . # PM: And , I think we stop for lunch now . # UI: , pretty soon I think , I guess that's now . # ME: Are we are we finished ahead of schedule ? # PM: We might possibly have done . # UI: Alright , see you all soon . # PM: If we've if we've finished at five minutes before the meeting's supposed to finish , then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch . # PM: Right . I just have to there's a few little bits and pieces I have to write down , but Take your headsets off , kick back , smoke 'em if you got 'em .
# ME: Oh right okay . # ME: I cover myself up . # PM: I feel like Madonna with one of these on . # PM: I said I feel like Madonna with one of these on . # ME: I've always wanted one of these , I really have . # ME: Where do you buy 'em from ? # PM: Right . Hello everybody . # PM: Back again for another wonderful meeting . # PM: Is everyone ready ? # PM: we c we can hold on for a minute . # PM: I figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . # UI: That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive . # PM: Are you ready ? # PM: Okay , right , well , I take it that you are all ready now . # PM: alright first off we'll just recap from our last meeting . # PM: which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually supposed to be doing , and who we all are and stuff like that , mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . # PM: what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some R_ and D_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see I'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . # PM: , we're gonna hear your th three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want . # UI: Do you have any preference of order ? # PM: I'd like to hear o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the from Catherine actually first . # PM: what I'd like to hear about is if we've finally decided on what sort of energy we're gonna be using and # UI: I think she is still finishing her . # ID: No no , it's fine I'm just preparing . # PM: It's just that , let's hear from you first . # ID: Where is that thing ? # ID: Oh sorry , couldn't see . # ID: Would that work ? # PM: Get yourself in position . # ID: Okay , so that's me again . # ID: so for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is which was used in the fifties for torches , if you remember that kind of which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v # PM: I don't think any of us remember the fifties . # UI: Is it like a crank thing or something . # ID: It wouldn't be very fancy . # ID: You can have a kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days . # ID: So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work . # ID: Or you can use solar cells , but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but # UI: Well , there's sometimes combinations , I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power . # PM: Do sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ? # PM: Does anybody know ? # ID: I dunno actually . # UI: I think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but I don't know . # ID: Think the what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really . # ID: And if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , but I don't know if it's worth the cost . # ID: So we've got to discuss that . # PM: Okay , jolly good . # ID: For the case of the remotes itself , they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . # ID: You can have a curved one or a double curved one , if you know what I mean , so # PM: What's a double curved one ? # ID: You know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing . # ID: then the case material itself , so it can be uh either plastic or latex , rubber , wood , or titanium . # ID: And th for each of them you have cases where for example titanium , you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium . # ID: And if we are choosing solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account . # ID: But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . # ID: And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing , so we could # PM: So that might be an idea of using the rubber , but then it should , you know # UI: Let's have a squeezable remote . # ID: And also it doesn't break as easily maybe , # PM: when a T_V_ programme's got one # PM: watching the match and your team's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you . # PM: , I like that idea . # ID: So rubber would be Okay . # ME: I think rubber's # PM: Rubber , we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea ? # PM: You think you can market that ? # ME: But after my after my fashion thing , I think you'll realise that rubber is more # PM: Ooh , we like rubber , ooh . # ID: And then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , or you could have L_C_D_ , which gives you a display . # ID: scroll buttons , as well . # ID: So if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . # ID: So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . # ID: and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons . # PM: Well , we're gonna go with I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so # ID: So it's a constraint . # ID: , but is it a double curved one or not ? # ID: If it's not a double curved , then we've got the choice for the push-buttons , if it's a double curve , we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons . # ID: If that makes sense . # PM: push buttons instead of the wheel ? # UI: If it's rubber , isn't it malleable anyway , it doesn't matter if it's double I mean isn't a rubber case , mean it's completely flexed , I mean , it flexes to whatever they want it to ? # UI: Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case ? # PM: rubble double . # ID: No , but na le you see , you've got , okay , the energy that's one thing , # PM: I'll have a Big Mac , please . # ID: then you have the case is , whether it's flat or curved . # ID: And that's we don't care if it's rub rubber or not , but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . # ID: So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved . # ID: And I'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go I dunno why , but we need to go for rubber push-buttons . # ID: So , either I dunno we just need to decide on the on the case . # PM: Let's have rubber push buttons , hey . # UI: Go rubber . Go rubber the whole way . # ID: Let's go crazy . # ID: And then , do I have a last slide ? # ID: so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons . # ID: and the price that go with it with it , so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest . # ID: if we get a scroll-wheel , that's a higher price range . # ID: If we get an advanced chip which is used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive . # PM: Chip on print . It's a bit . # PM: Okay , what I'm not understanding here is , okay , advanced chip on print , which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the infra-red sender ? # ID: The infra-red . # PM: what a what alternatives do we have to that ? # PM: what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ? # ID: Well , if it's not chip on print then , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red . # ID: It's less expensive mm # ID: Technically speaking , it's not as advanced , but it does the job , too . # PM: So , why would we not go for that ? # PM: If it's something that's inside the unit . I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not . # PM: we wanna go for an i all # ID: So let's not go for the # PM: so long as it works , # PM: So let's not let's not bother with the chip on print . # ID: So it's either the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons . # PM: S , push buttons . # ME: What about the just developed sample sensor ? # UI: I think push-buttons is # PM: What about what ? # ME: G there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing . # PM: Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ? # ID: It'd be it'd be cool , but they are saying they've just developed it , # ID: I'm just guessing . But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and # UI: Th the speech recognition option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us , # PM: It's not something that we wanna t go into with this product . # UI: The the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , basically , you can program a sample wi That when you say something it will give a response , and you program the response as well . # UI: Just clips of tha that you record yourself . # UI: So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it says , hello Rick , or whatever . # UI: But , I mean , it's not it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns comes on , but it's not that . # UI: It just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response . # ME: Oh , it just gives an answer . # UI: So , I mean , like what's the point of saying , Hello remote , I mean , hello , how are you ? # ID: Just if you are really lonely , maybe . # ME: I thought I thought it was when they said # UI: , if you're really lonely , it is it's # ME: I thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant like , # ID: Channel five . And then it switches on . # ME: channel five , and it will change . # UI: tha that w that w that would be more promising . # ME: Like you talk to it . # ME: Can I have channel five ? # UI: It it's just a remote that talks to you . # UI: I mean to certain cues . # ME: Oh , then forget about it . # ME: Oh right okay . # ID: Okay , so I'll go back , maybe , to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose . # ID: So for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the # UI: , I'm fine with the basic battery . # PM: Basic battery . # PM: It's cheap , it's cheerful , it's worked , does work . # ID: Cheaper option . # ID: Are you happy with that ? # ID: Okay . So we'll go for the battery . # ID: Then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ? # PM: We were go we were going with the late with the R_S_I_ rubber , weren't we ? # UI: so we want it rub rubber double curved . # ME: So it will look like something like this . # PM: The double whopper , please . # ID: Okay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons , # PM: we're going for the simple buttons . # UI: So rubber keys , . # ID: and that's fine ? # PM: And it's cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that the people have the R_ people were getting the complaining about R_S_I_ , and this is anti-R_S_I_ . # PM: So that's another marketing point that we can use . # ME: Well the rubber push-buttons . Don't you have to move your # PM: But anything is gonna have buttons . # PM: Even if it's a jog wheel , it's still repetitive . # ID: I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a # PM: You see , you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen . # ID: That they don't . # PM: It's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement . # PM: It's not actually what you are doing . # PM: But the fact that this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific # ME: , the rubber's good . # UI: We're giving them a way to burn off steam , basically , . # ME: , so they can sit there and go like # UI: Not that watching T_V_ should be that stressful . # PM: And you know , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children . # UI: Oh , I guess T_V_ can be stressful , if you're watching sports . # ID: Alright , that's me done . # PM: Okay , Gabriel . Let's let's hear from you about the it's the interface . # UI: , some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about . # UI: Okay , so I'm continuing with the user interface topic . # UI: And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division . # UI: It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them . # UI: I also took Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration , 'cause I think that's crucial as far as what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and how they're laid out . # UI: and so the manufacturing division sent some samples of interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , like the coffee machine . # UI: So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface . # UI: I guess , we basically vetoed that idea . # UI: It's it's pointless . # UI: it's just a sample sensor sample output . # UI: It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_ . # UI: so , they also give the they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod . # UI: so we've already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_ I mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing . # UI: the other suggestion , # ME: That does get annoying . # UI: and I have a feeling that we're interested in something more general , but they suggested , you know , going i a little bit into a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have lot of colours , the keys might be you know , funny or , or something for the elderly , where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons . # UI: But you know we can we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well . # UI: So , the key layout and design are really crucial . # UI: You don't want you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without always pressing the wrong one . # UI: And I didn't mention that we need a power button in our last I can give you an example here of , good layout and bad layout from our manufacturing department . # UI: So this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V_ on both of them , so it's sort of confusing for the user . # UI: this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose . # PM: Do we have an example of a good one ? # UI: And for something for kids . # UI: , I th I think my personal preferences of we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page . # UI: so I was against the speech recognition and against going towards anything in a niche sense . # UI: I think it should be more general . # UI: I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the L_C_ display were crucial for us . # UI: And , that's it for me . # PM: Well let's so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ? # PM: The the interface type we're going for # UI: So we're not gonna have any sort of display I think . # PM: Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons . # UI: So , it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons . # UI: I think we shall have a limited number of buttons , ideally , I mean a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad . # UI: And some sort of it will either have a lock button like we mentioned or a cover or something like that . # UI: I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that . # UI: Well now that we've decided on our # PM: Are we gonna hav an are we d have we decided on whether w we're gonna s supplement it with anything , you know , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we're not we're just gonna go for something # UI: it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy , # UI: , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like a black with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow , or something like that . # PM: Okay . Okey-dokey . # PM: , I don't have any other questions on this . # PM: Let's move over to # UI: I guess the fact also that we are having a rubber case would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . # UI: I mean , 'cause s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button . # UI: But I think that should be I mean , I can speak with the button department , but I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents the other the other buttons from operating . # PM: , the button that just does that , . # UI: So that should be simple . # ME: Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets and what the fashions are for next year . # ME: so from looking at this year's trends and fashions and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market , we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to which we've already probably discussed . # ME: the most important aspect is look and feel . # ME: So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have . # ME: So it has to be # PM: , why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_ ? # ME: second , it should be technologically innovative . # PM: What's that mean ? # ME: Technologically it should be like work , basically , I guess . It should work . # UI: Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense , # UI: I mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market . # PM: now the trouble is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap . # UI: Actually , I mean , these first two points we've already sort of gone away from , 'cause our rubber one is not fancy I mean it's different , but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy . # UI: If that's what people want then we maybe we're going in the wrong direction . # UI: And it's not technologically innovative either . # PM: Maybe we could # ME: So , no loose That's why I was thinking , Bluetooth , 'cause if you like put up Bluetooth , and it's like a Bluetooth remote control , everybody's gonna like , oh , 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is , like people and when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for , they don't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not . # PM: Of course , they do . # ME: Well , they do , but it's like it's not # PM: One hundred per cent , that's your first thing , you go , oh I'm not gonna buy that , 'cause I dunno if it works or not . # ME: , but it looks good . # ME: If it looks good and it's it can just be there for decoration . # PM: Okay , well , what do you two think about this ? # UI: So is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other # PM: , what I don't understand what m # UI: electronics ? # ME: You could always insert , . # UI: that's basically what it allows you to do , # PM: and it this is just gonna all this is being used for is your television . # ME: , but , I mean , people like # PM: It would that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no television does , # ME: Well , if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art . # PM: That would mean we'd have to make a television as well . # ID: Bluetooth would , for example , enable you , I think , to um connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs or something , you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now . # ID: Things like that . # PM: No , that would be your telephone in with your television . # UI: the that wouldn't be the remote so much , # ID: No , but if you get Bluetooth on the remote , you'd be able to # PM: Nah , the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible , basically . # ID: I with the television , . # ID: I was just trying to find an advantage . # ID: Wha what w what advantage would you get for the # ME: Well , it doesn't # PM: An and there is no there is no such thing # ME: Like it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth , that was just an idea , but like it needs do something that , you know , is new . # ME: Whether it's a battery it could be something really minor , you know , like but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people've already seen it , people've already got it . # ME: If we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have and just go creative . # ID: Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then . # ID: It's been done for watches , but I haven't seen that for remotes , yet . # PM: Okay . , this that's very good . # ME: And then you can market it . # ME: Never have to change a battery again . # ID: Change the batteries ever again . # PM: And and this is all tying in very nicely . # PM: The fact that it's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about . # PM: Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it . # ID: well , and in little characters you say , but not too much . # PM: But , by the squeezing it the # ME: I think , safety s # UI: , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator . # PM: , that's a great idea . Well done . # ME: Third most important aspect is it's easy to use . # UI: we're all about that . # ME: And I think we've all worked that out . # ME: okay , in the fashion , how it's supposed to look . # ME: Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . # ME: So next year people will be buying , I found this really funny , you know , strawberry shaped chairs , # UI: Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a and an avocado key on them . # PM: I wanna watch the pineapple channel . # ME: Rubber things . # ME: and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , so it's not quite spongy , but spongy , I would say is # PM: Well spongy , that's where . # PM: , we're ahead of the game there . # UI: , that's great for us . # ME: And so personal what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel , while still keeping to the company's image , basically . # ME: . I had to say So we're moving in the right direction like # PM: Alright , no , this i this is good , so through all that we've we go we're right , we're gonna go back to going with the kinetic thing , # PM: that's great , using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-R_S_I_ you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries , and I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though . # ID: No vegetables . # UI: , I don't know how we incorporate We don't have to follow every trend , I guess . # ME: Maybe make it like fruity colours or something . # UI: The power button could be like a big apple or something . # ID: Well , but Apple would sue you for that . # UI: They don they don't own all images of apples . # ID: sued the Beatles so # UI: Okay , we'll make it a pomegranate , a big pomegranate . # PM: Well , okay , it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally agreed on is its image . # PM: Like , we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be , or like are we going it looks slick , but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing ? # ME: I think , if it's rubber it needs to be # PM: I mean you said earlier on i it should be funky . # ME: I think , it's it should be I mean , what do you associate with rubber ? # ME: You know like # PM: L keep it clean , keep it clean . # ME: really different colours basically . # ME: Okay , sor I sorry , I used the wrong word , what do you associate with the mate the material that material ? # ME: like I'm just thinking bright colours . # ME: Bright natural colours , nothing too # PM: Bright , but not too bright . # ME: Bright , but too not Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink . # ME: Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like # PM: Like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that , do you mean ? # ME: And on the back of it have the logo . # UI: The one thing I'm wondering about , I hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of having # PM: I mean we that's we # UI: I mean if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes , and then a big spongy pink t tomato remote . # PM: This is the remote control tomato . # UI: I mean what are ninety per cent of people gonna take ? # ME: I can say in this country , you'll get , you know , lots of people wanting something really funky and cool . # ME: and kids will be walking in with their parents saying , Mummy I wanna buy that one . # ME: And parents will see the will see the pro as well , because it's like kids won't break it , it's not breakable if you throw it around . # ME: Especially with younger kids , you know they can pick it up and The only thing is that really small kids might chew on it , but # PM: Well , it's gotta be chew proof . # ID: I'm gonna write that down . # ME: so it's rea it's quite it's quite like user friendly and also for different families , like family use as well , so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , I think . # ME: Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like pink remote control for their room something . # PM: So , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the # ME: So like you walk in , you're like , oh I like that remote control , because it's so bright , and then , and then the shop assistant comes up and says , oh what colour would you like ? # ME: and then they go like , oh I can choose the colour wow . # ME: So it puts , I think , even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of , you've got all colour it's either that or nothing . # ME: So they also get to pick . # ME: Well , personally I like walking into a shop and choosing a colour . # UI: I mean , that seems to work well with for products like iPod , where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just by the fact of choosing . # ID: Although I'd be curious to see how many # ME: D you've got the # ID: You know , there are some colours that I wouldn I would never choose , and I would be curious how many people choose that colour . # PM: Well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know , if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular . # ID: And produce less of the silly colours , maybe . # PM: Okay . Alright . Well , we'll alright let's what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then from you Catherine wi your y you know you're gonna be working on the look and feel design . # PM: Gabriel , you're gonna be working on , you know come up with the user interface design . # PM: Then basically , you two are gonna be working together on this . # PM: You won't be going off to your separate offices . # PM: and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay . # PM: I think , it's gonna you know , come up ki you know , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some i some physical ideas . # PM: 'Cause at the moment , you know , it's hard . # PM: We were kinda going , it's gotta feel nice , it's gotta look cool and that it's you know now we can actually start , you know , s some sort of physical something or other . # UI: That sounds good . # PM: and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation . # PM: And I will be talking to the bosses , basically , and f fielding off some more spam and that's it really . # PM: Keeping things t well , you know , ho hopefully keeping things together . # PM: This is this is good . # PM: So we know for definite we know we've now got some definite things going on . # PM: We definitely know how it's powered , we definitely know that it's gonna be a simple buttons , we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things , so we've we're keeping the costs down . # PM: It's this rubber casing that we can sell as fun and funky . # PM: Don't know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff . # PM: People , you know , people are saying , oh , standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury , well this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite , It's supposed to fix it rather than cause it . # PM: you know , we're gonna we we're gonna as a sort of extra something on it , you know what extra things are there extra things this product have ? # PM: We'll look into this lock key facility , although whether or not it happens , or is possible , I don't know , but something to look into . # PM: Okay . I think that's well done everybody . # PM: Anyone have any questions , # PM: everyone know what they're doing ? # PM: 'Cause if you don't , you'll I'm sure you'll soon get an e-mail about it . # UI: Mm , I think we all know what we need to do now . # ME: This gives you all the details ? # PM: Okay . right well . # PM: It's we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish . # PM: I got a note saying that you two who are gonna be working together so bef before you all disappear off just # UI: I'll stay in here . # UI: Does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check , or is that # PM: I think , it's , I think , it's gonna be par part more of a profit sharing on the product . # UI: So we're buying fut I mean , we're getting futures in the company . # PM: , I think i I think that's I think that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment . # UI: So we really have a incentive to make this remote work . # UI: I'd like to share in the coffee machine profits , because that's really doing well . # PM: I want a share in the space rocket . # PM: Did you see that this k that this company we've made a spaceship . # UI: This company has its fingers in a lot of different pots . # UI: , we're definitely not in the money making department . # UI: Well I did notice looking at I mean , they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the R_R_ brand and to be immediately noticeable . # UI: I mean , if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page , it's not obvious . # UI: Well it is to us , because we worked here for years and we use that coffee machine , but it's doesn't have the colour scheme of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just sil silver and black . # PM: And the spaceship doesn't have the R_ have a massive R_ and R_ down the side of it # PM: but I still want one . # PM: Okay . I've just had a sign flashing up saying , finish the meeting . # UI: Right , well , I guess that's us . # PM: It's not telling it's not saying do anything in particular just yet . # PM: So maybe you should go back to your own offices . # ID: Are we taking these off ? # PM: , it says you two .
# PM: Play-Doh's edible . # PM: Did you know that ? # PM: It's definitely # ME: Because kids . # ID: I used to eat it . # UI: I've , I've definitely eaten it before . # UI: I didn't know was edible . # PM: It's it's chew proof . # ME: But , it's made edible 'cause , It's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then Well , normal babies . # UI: Actually that makes sense , because I remember like , peopl I dunno if my Mom ever did it but I remember other people's Moms making like home-made Play-Doh where you just like make the colouring and make some sort of sort of dough . # PM: Everybody everybody ready ? # PM: Okay , let's have your let's get have the presentation ? # UI: We've got some . # ID: We've got a cool prototype . # UI: , it's pretty exciting . # UI: everything that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , very simple and easy to use , # ID: Double curved . # UI: , double curved , but also something that was gonna jump out at people , something that would be different , separate it from the other remotes out on the market . # UI: So I think if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what a nice thing we have going here . # UI: So , basically , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , the thumb button is the power button . # UI: Your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , ring finger is volume up , your pinkie is volume down . # ME: What's the big blue thing ? # UI: That's the lock button , has a L_ on it # UI: and then the M_ is a mute button . # UI: And then it also has digit # UI: For muting the # UI: and then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want . # UI: So it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available , but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different . # PM: That certainly does . # UI: So all the , I mean the important keys are right at your f you know right at a convenient place for you to access them . # ID: Which is ant anti-R_S_I_ . # UI: So you don't you . It should be . # UI: And it's also conformable to the size of your hand . # UI: I mean if that's too big , it's a rubber remote , so you can , you know # UI: So d does that what mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it # ME: Oh it's so cute . # PM: I have one thing about it , but it's a small thing , but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one . # UI: , that's good thinking , . # PM: But , that's I don't see why that's not possible . # UI: , if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed remotes . # PM: They make left-handed scissors , you know . # UI: , I didn't I didn't think about that , but I'd , . # ME: , but then but then you can learn to use your right h like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ? # ID: , I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse . # ME: , I'm sure they'll be able to I mean it's only pressing buttons , you don't have to do anything , you know , extraordinary . # ME: I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so # ID: Imagine d are you right handed ? # ID: Imagine you're doing it with your left hand , I don't think it's too # ID: But we can have both # ME: Have them in stock . # ME: Make 'em more appealing as well . # PM: But other than that , I mean and that's , you know , that's just something , I think I think it's great , great idea . # UI: Do you think it says R_R_ ? # ID: I think it does . # PM: I think it's , well , if the R_R_ motto is , we bring fashion to electronics , I'd say that could be quite fashionable . # UI: Fashion to electronics . # UI: And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue . # UI: Plus red , which is sort of a fruit and vegetable uh . # UI: So that's our end of things # PM: It's come up with what we've you know , the things that's what we've what we were looking at doing , hasn't it , all seems to be there . # ME: And all the playing around is # PM: before we move on # ME: , I'm just do you wanna plug in ? # PM: I need that cable . # PM: One thing I do need to do we need to look at , is the costs . # UI: The costs , was that what you said ? # ID: Play-Doh is very cheap . # ME: Play-Doh won't last very long everybody'll go like , oops , it's gone . # UI: But it's edible . # ME: Well , they'll buy more of them if you eat them , . # UI: That was the main criteria from the last meeting , it had to be chew proof . # PM: Okay , now I think we'll do this I could do you know , I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you , # PM: but it's just easy enough to go through it with you , so we're going for the kinetic power . # PM: And the electronics , we decided on it being just a simple , the easiest thing that's inside it . # PM: So the case , we've gone for the double curved . # PM: and it's made out of rubber . # PM: The interface is push-buttons . # PM: And button supplements well they're in diff special colours , aren't they ? # PM: So special colours . # ME: It's better for # PM: Special form , they're a special form there in shapes and stuff . # UI: I mean , these ones on the side are curved kind of , so # ME: And special material . # PM: Are they made out of any special material ? # PM: No they're not . # PM: They're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything , they're just simple # UI: The buttons are rubber . # ME: Well they're rubber , aren't they ? # PM: So let's see if that comes within budget . # PM: That is gonna cost # ME: We're under budget . # PM: That's gonna cost ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make . # PM: And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty . # UI: And we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected . # PM: this is all very good . # PM: The bosses will be very pleased . # PM: Okay , let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you . # PM: Save it in save it in the my documents . # ME: It's already saved , I think . # PM: So , that's done with this with this doodah , so you're . Gonna do what you were gonna do , # PM: your evaluation . # ME: This is where we all get to I get to write on the , oops , on the board . # PM: I love the smell of that Play-Doh . # UI: have some have some . # ME: So , evaluation . # ME: We're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria . # ME: I've got the criterias . # ME: And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven , one being true , so it's more like it's fits the criteria , and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria . # ME: And the criterias are , and I'll draw this up on the board so we have a box And this is false , this is just like to keep you informed . # ME: So seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle . # ME: So the first criteria . # ME: Do you all get what we're doing ? # ME: Okay , first criteria , look and feel . # ME: So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ? # ME: As it is it colour-wise and is it spongy ? # ME: So what mark should we give for that ? # PM: I would give it a seven . # PM: Oh sorry , one , d . # ME: So I'll just write criteria one we get one . # ME: Second criteria , new technology . # ME: Have we implemented new technology ? # ME: As in the new high-tech # ID: Well , the kinetic thing , . # UI: That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new . # ME: So we'll give it a # UI: It's ergonomic , but that's not that's a design that's a des that's a design thing , . # PM: , but that's not a technological thing , that's another thing , i that's another marketing thing . # PM: So on the technical side of it # ME: I'd say it's about a twoish ? # UI: It's about in the mid in the middle somewhere , maybe , I dunno . # ME: So criteria three is it easy to use ? # ME: I think it's a one , I think . # PM: I'd say it's I wouldn't not if you're left-handed it's not . # PM: I would give it a I would give it a two , 'cause i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people , but # ME: But if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then ? # UI: If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one , but otherwise a two . # PM: Give it a t give it a two . # ME: 'Kay , criteria four is costs . # PM: It's come in under budget . # PM: So that's a definite one . # UI: That was great . # PM: Amount of buttons . # ME: Like the amount of buttons , # PM: Contains only the necessary buttons . # ME: 'cause people like a lot le like So it's a one ? # ME: criteria six . # ME: R_S_I_ is it good against ? # ME: Yes . Very good . # PM: So it's anti-R_S_I_ . # ME: And criteria seven , which is the last one , does it get lost ? # ME: Is it easy to get lost ? # PM: I don't think it's gonna get lost easily . # UI: It is very bright , . # ME: But it is smallish . # UI: It's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something , you know . # UI: Maybe it will . # ME: Mm . I think i it would , could be , could get lost . # UI: You think it could lost # ME: I mean it's not fully it's not fully like you can't say # ME: I mean , it's not a one , definitely . # PM: I mean , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but # UI: , anything , I mean . Okay . It's bigger than the average mobile , I guess . # UI: But , it can get lost . # ME: The mobiles get lost all the time . # UI: Okay , two is fine . # ME: But then you ring 'em and you find them . So . So , that's that . # ME: So that's the evaluation , so I'd say Yay . # PM: Alright it's all systems go . # ID: We've , we've done well . # ME: It's like a number one . # ME: Number one product . # ME: All done , thanks . # ME: We fitted all the criterias . # PM: Well done , Reissa . # ME: So that's that one . # PM: Okay , I think I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know , little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it , you know , both individually and as a team . # PM: You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments , and then come together and worked in , you know , integrally , you know , at the right times , psp , you know , especially you two . # PM: That's all , you know , gone very well and be you know , has been good communication going on . # UI: during our design I mean there was some s some heated discussion , but we kept we tried to keep it cool and # PM: Did you have to go down to the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about ? # UI: just We just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and # UI: Now you guys have been a great team . # UI: Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other R_R_ teams , . # PM: I think So I , you know , and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new , something that hasn't been done before , we haven't we're not just rehashing an old design . # ME: In four diff in four meetings . # ME: Funny , all designer meetings could be this quick . # PM: You know , maybe this isn't a simulation , maybe this is actually so it's like Sony or someone like that they're just , they get # UI: I think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote . # ME: They're using our ideas . # PM: , two years' time this will be on the market . # PM: Ex exactly that product we'll go , we designed that and no-one will believe us . # UI: So at this stage , I mean , is this the last meeting of the project ? # UI: We don't have another one after it's gone to marke market or something ? # PM: I think when this meeting's finished like officially , there b we'll get a questionnaire to fill in . # ME: Just start summarising now . # ME: You can reply to the same message . # PM: I haven't got message . # ME: See summary , there . If you just reply to that one . # UI: So there's no way to like predict what our 'Cause we had a we originally had a As far as our financial goals , we had a specific number for profits that we wanted . # UI: It was fifty mil fifty million # ME: Was it was it fifty or five ? # UI: I don't remember . # UI: But there's not a way to compute that , I mean , since we saved on the on the production cost , do we know how much we're making on profit ? # PM: It gets handed over to another department . # ME: Depends how much we sell . # PM: What our what our project was to come up with the product , basically . # PM: the for the and just basically is it come can is it within budget . # PM: When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and , you know , the b the profits and all that that's other departments it's another team that actually work out the mai the # UI: But we have a vested interest # PM: the all the guys in the profit sharing , . # UI: prof profit sharing . # PM: You know , we've made i we've made # ME: We finished an hour earlier . # PM: we've designed the product , we've ma we've got the prototype , it's within budget , it's does everything that we wanted it to do . # PM: It's new , it's something that isn't out there already . # UI: I think actually and one advantage of this is that after the , you know , after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote , you know . # UI: We're not we're not you know , tying our cart to that one horse . # PM: Well , this is very marketable in that it is it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that , # PM: it's that it's , hang on , I wrote it down here somewhere Oh no I thi I put it in one of my e-mails that I sent off . # PM: that , you know , it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes actually do give you repetitive strain injury , our one does the complete opposite , you know , so that's something that's new , which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new . # UI: It make watching T_V_ healthy . # PM: , and if you're not having a good time with the T_V_ , you can f throw it about , you know . # PM: It's fine , it's kid proof . # ME: Just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them . # PM: Well , you can break the ornaments , but you won't break that . # PM: So all in all , I think we've done very well . # PM: Well done everybody . # UI: Right , you too . # PM: Drinks are on the company . # PM: In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to . # ID: Glad to hear that . # PM: Well , as far as I t as far as I know . # ME: We haven't got the five minute left thing yet . # PM: Anyone wanna play I spy ? # UI: I guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of silence . # UI: Should we call the day then ? # PM: I mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire . # PM: It's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before . # PM: But I'm not the authority to say that it is . # PM: how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this ? # PM: The sort of using of the pens and writing on these special pads and all that ? # ME: I love it . I love it . I think it's cool . # ME: Being all wired up and a vibrating pen and it's cool . # ME: Being watched . # UI: Your moment to shine . # PM: I thi you know , I'd n , as we said earlier , I've not never seen that before . # PM: something that t the whiteboard thingy , that's great . # PM: , but a p a pen with a camera on it , I don't think it's such a new thing . # PM: I mean it's i or in such a new idea . # PM: It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff , but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text . # UI: I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it's just the first step . # UI: I guess we should end this , since we're off topic . # ME: Meeting adjourned .
# PM: Good morning everybody . # PM: I'm glad you could all come . # PM: I'm really excited to start this team . # PM: I'm just gonna have a little PowerPoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . # PM: My name is Rose Lindgren . # PM: I I'll be the Project Manager . # PM: our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit , including a tool training exercise . # PM: And then we'll move into the project plan , do a little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes . # PM: First of all our project aim . # PM: we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about , it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly . # PM: I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those . # PM: so we're gonna divide us up into three compa three parts . # PM: First the functional design which will be first we'll do individual work , come into a meeting , the conceptional design , individual work and a meeting , and then the detailed design , individual work and a meeting . # PM: So that we'll each be doing our own ideas and then coming together and collaborating . # PM: we're gonna get to know each other a little bit . # PM: what we're gonna do is start off with let's start off with Amina . # PM: we're gonna do a little tool training , so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you . # PM: introduce yourself , say one thing about yourself and then draw your favourite animal and tell us about it . # ID: I don't know which one of these I have to bring with me . # PM: Probably both . # ID: Right , so , I'm supposed to draw my favourite animal . # ID: I have no drawing skills whatsoever . # ID: But let's see , introduce myself . # ID: My name is Alima Bucciantini . # ID: I'm from the state of Maine in the US . # ID: I'm doing nationalism studies , blah , blah , blah , and I have no artistic talents . # PM: How do you spell your name ? # ID: and I guess I'm the Industrial Designer on this project . # ID: let's see if I can get I will draw a little turtle for you all . # ID: Not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal , but just that I think they're drawable . # ID: And you have the pretty little shell going on . # ID: Some little eyes . Happy . # ID: That's a turtle . # PM: So what are your favourite characteristics ? # ID: I like the whole having a shell thing . # ID: It's quite cool carry your home around where you go , quite decorative little animals , they can swim , they can , they're very adaptable , they carry everything they need with them , and they're easy to draw . # PM: Shall we just go around the table ? # UI: my name is Iain and I'm the User Interface Designer for the project . # UI: And I'll try and draw my favourite animal . # UI: I should leave that one on there # ID: you can erase the turtle , # UI: shouldn't I before I callously rub it off . # PM: Might be nice to have them all up there at same time . # UI: I'm not gonna draw it quite to scale . # UI: Is that at least identifiable ? # UI: It's a whale , yes . # ME: Oh my god , it's better than what I'm gonna be able to do . # UI: the reason I like whales is 'cause they're well , first of all they're quite intelligent and also they're kind of mysterious , like we don't really know much about them or understand how they work , how they form groups . # UI: And I just find them interesting animals . # ME: Take my contraptions with me . # ME: Alright , I'm Jessy . # ME: I'm from around D_C_ ish sort of in the U_S_ . # ME: And we're gonna keep the deep sea sort of theme going on , animal . # ME: Don't really know how to draw this . # ME: Just where can I Maybe if I do the water , but how ? # ME: Sort of give an idea . # ME: I have no idea how one would explain this . # ME: Mm maybe with some whiskers . # ME: Briefly , it's supposed to be a seal . # ME: You can imagine it in the water . # ME: I like them , because they are like playful and silly sort of have a good time . # ME: Not gonna try and pretend like I can get any better than that . # PM: I'm Rose and I'm Project Manager , from California . # ME: It's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it . # PM: it's actually a coyote . # PM: Let's see . Let's see , # ME: That's impressive . # PM: let's give it a little bit of a snout , I don't know , some teeth . # ID: That's pretty impressive . # PM: I live I live right across the street from an open space in California . # PM: We have coyotes howl all the time . # PM: So I really enjoy their singing , you they're really beautiful animals . Mm . # PM: moving on to slightly more serious stuff . # PM: We're gonna talk about project finances . # PM: we have a couple we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of fifteen million Euro from our sales and because this is such this is for television it's a we have a market range of Internet , like it's an international market range , we don't have to worry about specifics . # PM: in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro . # PM: So we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for . # PM: just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project , I could I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , your first ideas about creating a new r remote control , what would be the best like you what are the features that you really like what are the features that you don't like , etcetera , # ME: I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the T_V_ like you have to do one for the power of the T_V_ and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going , I don't know . # ME: Now they keep combining all different remotes together , and I don't know if I necessarily like that 'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload . # ME: I just wanna watch the T_V_ . # ME: Always gets lost . # ME: Some sort of like device to help you find it . # UI: I've used , I've used remote controls , for things like T_V_ and the C_D_ player and video recorder and I guess they're pretty neat little tools . # UI: You don't have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel . # UI: So especially if you're someone really lazy like me they they're pretty nice . # UI: I find them they can be a bit annoying , especially , like you know if I'm watching T_V_ I have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me , you know , one for the T_V_ , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . # UI: And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , they've got too many buttons on them too sort of too sort of complicated when all I really wanna do is switch on and off , change the channel , change the volume . # ID: I agree with having too many remotes around . # ID: My dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , and I don't know how to work half of them . # ID: What's important for me , I guess , is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons , they are not too small , you know you know you need to n to know what you're doing . # ID: And one thing I particularly like is if you are not sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red . # ID: , I think there is a way around that , but I know in my residence right now the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on , so i it's just simpler just to just turn around the T_V_ itself , and I think that's if we're gonna make a remote control , it should actually work for what it's doing . # ME: What about like batteries and things like that , like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries or do all remotes require batteries ? # PM: I would imagine all of them , but we could but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery that would last a lot longer than like double A_s . # ID: something that doesn't # PM: like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of M_P_ three players now and that kind of thing . # PM: it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over to combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . # PM: like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote , and yet you don't wanna have five remotes . # PM: So how do we work with that ? # ID: Could we get something that just has doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that I'm not very coherent about , but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off , channel changing . # ME: And maybe that spatially divides it , so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's , you know , like the top thing on the remote , I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it , but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here , then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here , all the whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together , # ME: 'cause then you like , I don't even know what I'm turning on . # ID: and if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day . # PM: so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things . # PM: Because that is one thing that remotes tend to have buttons that the T_V_s no longer have as well . # PM: So like you have to have them somewhere , 'cause you're gonna m need those special functions occasionally . # PM: but not necessarily on the m the normal remote . # UI: Can I ask , are we designing a remote control for a television only # PM: Good question . # UI: , and if this device is just to be used for the television would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ? # PM: I don't know that yet . # UI: or should we just stick to just stick to having television related buttons on it ? # PM: It's a good question . # PM: I'll look into that . # ME: I think it's just T_V_ , I mean , if it if we're taking it just new product a new television remote control that's not like doesn't say . # ME: You know , things might be more advanced than that . # UI: So we should maybe we should assume that i t it's just a television that we're wanting to control . # UI: I mean I suppose it would be nice to have playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well I don't know if that works technologically or not . # ID: I guess we have to define what we're aiming for . # ID: If it's just a television then that it's a bit simpler , 'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it . # ME: It's an idea with the buttons being really . # ID: If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it . # PM: Okay . 'Kay sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas . # PM: Mind if we move on ? # PM: now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes . # PM: I believe we've actually been only working on this one for about twenty , so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like , but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually . # PM: the industrial design , Alima will be doing the working design . # PM: the User Interface Designer , that's for . Technical functions , I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons . # PM: user requirements , so you'll be hearing about different trends , about different things that people need , I guess kind of the same discussion that we've been having , we'll get from the actual consum s consumers . # PM: And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach . # PM: I realised in this past one we didn't have much , we just wanted to get a little brain-storming done . # PM: so very exited to see all your animals and how what wonderful artists we all are . # PM: Any questions ? # UI: What we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting ? # UI: Do we know that ? # PM: I haven't gotten an agenda yet , I'll put that together . # PM: I'm sure as we'll each get our own instruction and then because what we gonna do is first our individual actions and then we'll come back together . # PM: So I'm sure we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time # ID: I'm sure we'll be busy . # PM: I'll type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you . just including all the things that we talked about . # UI: Can you e-mail your slides as well ? # UI: Is that possible ? # PM: Yes , I yes , I think I can . # PM: I'll just attach it to an email . # PM: And you're number two , # PM: Is that correct ? # PM: It was lovely meeting you all . # PM: Just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails . # PM: Let me see if I can do that right now .
# PM: Good to see you all again . # PM: Let's see if that comes up . # PM: This is our functional design meeting . # PM: Just a sec while my PowerPoint comes up . # PM: Okay . Mm we put the fashion in electronics . # PM: our agenda today just check the time , it's twelve thirteen . # PM: . I'm gonna do an opening , talk about did you all get the minutes ? # PM: I e-mailed them to you . # PM: I'm also putting 'em them in the shared folder . # PM: So then I we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations . # PM: I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received , and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions . # PM: Finally we'll just close . # PM: We're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes . # PM: First of all the functional design objectives . # PM: we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function . # PM: three presentations , you can go in any order you choose . # ME: Mm shall we go in the order that you just did it ? # PM: Sure , please do . # ME: How do I hook my screen up ? # ID: I think , you might have to disconnect Rose . # UI: there's a wee a wee plug just that one there # ME: Where does it go ? # ME: I'm not supposed to move this , # UI: that's it , And then you have to press function F_ eight # PM: Function , F_ eight , . # UI: I think it is on your laptop . # PM: The blue one , F_N_ . # ME: Where's function ? # PM: Is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in # ID: I think you just have to push it in really hard . # ME: Push the screw . # PM: It's taking it a little bit # ME: I've never attached to anything . # ID: neither have I . # PM: 'Kay there you go . # ME: I don't know if you guys are able to get access to the report that was online or if I'm the only one who is . # ME: I don't even know how to play this . # PM: Press the little presentation . # PM: It's the it looks like a Y_ kind of over there above Draw . # PM: There , that one , there you go . # ME: Alright . So we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked . # ME: I guess Real Reaction did some market research . # ME: They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and they watched them watch T_V_ and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had . # ME: What they found was they analysed people's desires and needs . # ME: Focusing on their desires , people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly , seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that and that they more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote . # ME: I don't know anything beyond what fancy means , but that's particularly of use to us , I think . # ME: also they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age , so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition , whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions . # ME: people also had certain frustrations , that I think that we could try to take into consideration with our design . # ME: That being people k frustrated with losing their remotes . # ME: I think , over fifty percent of the people mentioned that was their biggest frustration . # ME: People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons , it just needs to be easy to use . # ME: It also mentioned something called R_S_I_ and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what R_S_I_ is , # UI: Repetitive strain injury . # ME: because I don't know . # UI: Repetitive strain injury . # ME: People do not like that . # ME: So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that , the repetitive use , I guess , caused a strain . # ME: looking at the needs people specified , the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour . # ME: People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote . # ME: And what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume . # ME: People also zap like to change the channel , about sixty five per cent during an hour of use . # ME: So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings , because they're used much more infrequently and probably just complicate what's going on . # ME: So I think that some things that we might wanna think about , the idea of an L_C_D_ screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were , so I dunno know if that's coming to me later , or something like that . # ME: But something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use , make sure that , you know , something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often . # ME: And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like , that it has a fancy appeal and that it's not ugly and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it , so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that . # PM: Thank you very much . # PM: That was that was great . # PM: 's move on to the next presentation on effects . # ME: have I unscrewed it ? # PM: User interface , Interface . # ME: And I think that's in the shared , if I did it right , if anyone wants to look at it . # UI: Right so I'm gonna talk about the technical functions design of the remote control . # UI: We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is . # UI: It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television , so i it's basically a communication device . # UI: We we tell the remote control what we want to do , it sends a message to the television saying change the channel , change the volume , adjust these settings , adjust the brightness . # UI: how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control ? # UI: First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications . # UI: We need to know what our final product is gonna be like , so we need a clear idea of exactly what this product does , how it works , and what the end-user is gonna want from this product . # UI: a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , and then trying to get some feedback about h how well these particular prototypes work , sorta find out what people think of 'em . # UI: using a remote control is quite a subjective experience . , and different people sort of prefer different things . # UI: we should remember that remote controls are a fairly standard piece of equipment . # UI: When a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places . # UI: So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design so that we're not completely shocking people . # UI: But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas and to make something that's perhaps a little bit different , something that stands out . # UI: also in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities . # UI: the first of these is technological what can we do with the current state of technology as it is . # UI: The second is economic , we need to find a balance between features and price . # UI: as you mentioned things like voice recognition would add to the price but it would also im improve the design of the product . # UI: I had a look on the on the web to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls . # UI: In analysing these we can consider what things what's good about them , what things do they get right , what's bad about them , what's wrong with 'em , how we can improve on the designs that I found and what can we do to make our product stand out from the large majority of remote controls . # UI: Here's two examples probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum . # UI: on the left here we've got an engineering-based design for a remote control , so it's one that's got lots of buttons , it's fully featured , everything you might possibly want to do is there , you know , it's got forward , backwards , up , down , channel numbers , volume , freeze frame . # UI: it's fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it , but once you've learned it you can you can do whatever you want with your T_V_ . # UI: The one on the right is a lot more basic . # UI: It's just got the essential functions of the T_V_ changing the channel , play , stop , volume . # UI: It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it , but again th it's swings and roundabouts . # UI: There are disadvantages , you can't use it say to freeze the television picture . # UI: there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control . # UI: So we've got to find our find a way of striking a balance between the two . # UI: as I said before , remote controls are subjective , different people want different things . # UI: personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that's simple , it it's easy to use , it's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel . # UI: It it does everything that I need it to , as I said before , I'm quite lazy , I don't wanna walk across the room just to adjust my television . # UI: I also want something that looks cool , and that feels good , that's ergonomically designed . # PM: Thank you very much . # PM: That was very useful . # PM: It's funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes . # PM: And neither of them were very pretty , you know ? # ID: I think that could be our selling point . # ME: A fashion remote . # UI: I think there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool . # UI: And I think that's why companies like Apple've 've made a lot of progress . # ID: I really can't see what I'm doing , so does anyone have a # ID: look at that , showing up already . # ME: So wait , did it let you go on the Internet or was that just what it let you see ? # UI: that was just on the d on the company web site , . # ME: 'Cause I was like googling and then I'm like wait it won't let me google . # ID: Alright how do I play again ? # PM: it's right above Draw . # PM: There are three thingy if it's way at the bottom . Under three icons and it's the one that looks like a desk . # ID: Okay . So this is our working design presentation . # ID: I had a bit of some issues with this , because I wasn't able to find everything I needed , but I guess that's we're still in early stages . # ID: Though th the thing about working design is the what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function . # ID: one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder . # ID: It works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through a filter and that filters out , and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work . # ID: Don't know if I'm explaining that very well , but how do I get to the next s h the method as working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function , what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done . # ID: the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points at which you need something to happen . # ID: So you make a schematic of the way that the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function . # ID: And then I think the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately . # PM: You just press just click . # PM: That'll be fine . # ID: the findings that I got very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that 'cause you don't need a sight line . # ID: So that's one thing we're gonna work on . # ID: the user interface is critical here , because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data , which then goes through the infra-red , so the chip that I think Ian is designing , is gonna be crucial . # ID: And really it all comes down to the to the user , because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design . # ID: the components that we find here are the energy source , you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver . # ID: So you have four main components and they are designed sort of like this . # ID: You have your energy source right there which then brings energy or information to the chip , which is also controlled by the users . # ID: You have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip ooh 's not what I wanted to do uh . # PM: use that thing you can go back , previous . # ID: Sorry about that , guys . # ID: let's just get back to my schematic here . # PM: Double click on it . With the right with the left hand one . # ID: I think it's frozen . # ID: Here . Don't show me that tip again . # ID: Sorry about this , guys . # ID: I'm kind of pathetic with things like this . # ID: So you have your energy source , your user interface who's controlling the chip , the chip also uses the energy , and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infra-red bulb , which will then bring the data to the receiver . # ID: hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way . # ID: This is the parts of the working design that need to be figured out . # ID: And personal preferences , besides the fact that I can't spell , we need a long-lasting energy source , people don't wanna be changing it a lot . # ID: We need a chip that works well with the user interface , that isn't too complicated . # ID: We need a straightforward interface , like Ian was saying , simple , not overwhelming it with information and we need a reliable and clear infra-red signal , so that you're not waving your remote around and having to get frustrated and go do it by hands . # ID: So that's pretty much it for the working design . # ID: Rose , do you think you can give me a hand with this ? # PM: Yes , absolutely . # PM: I can never tell which way to turn these things . # PM: Lefty loosey , righty tighty , # PM: Lefty loosey , righty tighty . # UI: Lefty loosey . # UI: Never heard that before , that's good . # UI: I'll think of that every time now . # ID: It's gonna stick in your head . # ME: , that's a good one it'll stick with you . # PM: I have nothing on my screen . # PM: Okay , it's fine . # PM: requirements . We have a couple new requirements that I was just e-mailed right before the meeting and that we have to keep in mind as we're creating this . # PM: We didn't bring it up yet , or at all in the meetings so far , but we're not gonna work with teletext because well it that's been taken over by the internet , so we're not gonna worry about we're not gonna worry about that . # ME: What's teletext ? # ID: , it's a British thing . # UI: You don't have it in the States ? # PM: W d could would you care to explain it ? # UI: I didn't realise . # UI: it's like a I suppose it's kind of similar to a very basic web browser . # UI: you have like you have numbers on your remote control , y and you type in the page number you want , so like you type a hundred on your remote control and this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it . # UI: And you just type numbers to go to different pages and it gives you information , mostly rather boring stuff like what's on T_V_ next and share prices and that kind of thing . # ID: Lottery numbers and sport scores . # UI: news headlines . # ID: But if you ever see the T_V_ saying like go to page one sixty on Ceefax now , that's what they're talking about . # UI: It's earl it's pretty old technology . # UI: It's like nineteen eighties . # ME: That explains a lot . # ID: I have no idea why we don't have it , # PM: Interesting . # PM: Okay , well , we're not gonna the management has decided we're not gonna work with that . # PM: and we're also gonna w like your question earlier whether this is going to be t for television , video , or etcetera . Just for television . That's what we're focused on . # PM: otherwise becomes to complex , we wanna get this out very quickly . # PM: We only have a short amount of time . # PM: and finally there's more marketing , I think , our corporate image has to be recognisable . # PM: while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design . # UI: So what's our corporate image like ? # UI: It's kind of yellow colour with we put fashion in electronics . # PM: Looks like , kind of a yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the R_s in # UI: It's like double R_ . # PM: But it's , we put the fashion in electronics . # PM: So we gotta keep that in that in mind . # ID: so we want something that looks good # ID: and is yellow . # PM: or ha maybe some buttons could be yellow . # PM: Like , we can we can play around with it a little bit . # PM: we need to talk about our functions and our target group . # PM: We need to decide who our target group is . # PM: You in your analysis of different market of the marketing , you identified that different groups wanted different things or had certain preferences , for example that older people didn't really care for voice recognition , but younger people did . # PM: who are we aiming this at ? # ID: if we're gonna say that function fashion we put the fashion in electronics then you automatically , I think , a sort of younger group that that's who's gonna be attracted to this . # ME: I do think , who's gonna have the money to buy that also , that one ? # PM: It's gonna be twenty five Euro remember , so it has to be avai marketable to whomever it is . # UI: Is it is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes w with a television ? # UI: 'Cause that would affect the way that we market it . # PM: at least right now what we're doing is deciding on just the remote itself , so it will probably be sold separately , twenty five Euro by itself . # ME: The only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation and basically there's a big jump , after thirty five people don't really care if it has voice , so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea . # ME: I dunno I'm gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later , but if that's sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range . # ID: that's probably a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway , so that might be a fairly good target group for us . # PM: those are that's all specific for speech recognition . # PM: Are we gonna use that as one of our functions ? # UI: I would say no , because it's gonna add too much to the price . # UI: Especially if we are marketing it as a separate product , people are gonna be paying we've got a price limit of was it twelve and a half Euros for to produce it ? # ID: To produce it , . # PM: To produce it , yes . # UI: And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises . # ME: But what else are we gonna put , I mean not that I'm really gung-ho about it , I don't know what else you can put in a remote to make it technologically advanced though . # ME: So like other than just making it look good , how is it I mean it can look really great and still have the same up-n-down buttons and why's anyone gonna buy a new remote ? # ID: but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement ? # ID: Everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology , # PM: That's a good thing to keep in mind . # ID: in fact it could use it could mean , not . # ID: they might be overwhelmed with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology . # ME: If someone's looking to buy a new remote , don't they want like an upgrade ? # PM: we can look for we can look at upgrade or we can look at user-friendly . # ID: , simplification . # PM: Simplification , # ID: They could have a crap remote that came with their T_V_ that's just impossible to use , or maybe it broke , or maybe they're just missing it . # PM: And we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow # ME: Can you like I mean this may be too complicated , but , I wish I had something to explain it , like if it was just a simple , either this way or this way , that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out , kind of and like you got the rest the buttons , but the rest of them like went in . # ME: Do you know what I'm saying ? # PM: Kind of pull out of the side . # UI: There are remote controls like that , Like some T_V_s they have a sort of a sliding screen on the remote control of it that hides all the complicated buttons . # UI: So if you wanna do something complicated like programme your television or re-tune it , then you open up this little hatch or slide the screen down and there's all the all the special buttons . # ME: 'Cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them , never even have to see them and if you like get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just don't even read it then you'll never even know that those things can pull out . # ME: And you're a happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes , one that has the easy ones and one that has # ID: , that's a good idea . # ME: more complicated ones , # UI: I think that's a good idea , . # ME: but 's all still in one . # PM: we have to be careful that doesn't impede the chip transmitting information , but that's gonna be mostly technological thing . # PM: Okay , so what are we emphasising ? I what in this project ? # UI: Si simplicity and fashion . # PM: Simplicity and fashion . # ME: I think simplicity , fashion . # PM: those are very good goals , I think , that we have to keep in mind in with everything we do . Simplicity and fashion and , or usability however you wanna say that , which includes an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional , so that you don't have to travel around a lot . # ME: What can you do to like make the infra-red more functional , like why would it not be ? # ME: I'm just wondering . # PM: I think it's a lot to do with battery , but that's just my # ID: The battery and that I think that the chip takes the data and presents it well , without sort of scattering . # ME: So 's just the quality of the chip . # ID: The quality of all the components really , I mean , we can't really do anything shoddy work , 'cause it's gonna be visible down the line . # PM: So our target group , we're saying , fifteen to thirty five ? # ME: I dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing # PM: S voice recognition , which I kind of I kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control , like it might be necessary for a T_V_ but not for the remote c , you know . # UI: It's , it's pretty it's pretty high-tech . # PM: Seems a little bit and it might be too expensive . # ME: And if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice , like you know what I mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote you'd just talk to your T_V_ . # UI: It's for , like , the ultimately lazy people , who can't even be bothered to pick up the remote . # ME: I mean if I get m more numbers , I'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages . # ME: But this doesn't divide up anything and there was only a hundred subjects also , which isn't , I mean , really isn't that representative , especially if it's a hundred subjects that th they then can subdivide into age groups that means there's very few in each age group , # ID: but I th I think regardless we're aiming for the under sixty five or something . # PM: Under sixty five , okay , that's a good start . # PM: I'd say we're can we narrow it down to maybe teenagers and families ? # PM: 'Cause that would go up to like fifty ? # ID: Or like single professionals or something . # ME: Twenty to like fifty five . # PM: It's it's hard to narrow it down . # ID: It's really hard to figure out right now . # UI: I think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages . # UI: I mean , we said simplicity is one of the features , so it's going to appeal to people , maybe people who have problems with technology , you know , people who get scared by having lots of buttons , and that might be older people , but then we've also got fashion , which is something that definitely appeals to younger people . # ME: maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age , maybe we can define it by like the demographic of like h t how much money they have to spend or something like that , # UI: aim for a an income group . # ID: That's a good point . # ME: like , well obviously it has to be someone who owns a television , and like how recently have they bought their television like that sort of thing . # PM: So maybe it's more useful to d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is # PM: because , things so different will appeal to different people , Okay . oh , there're a couple functions do we want something so that do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost ? # PM: Like a button on a T_V_ you can press and it'll ring or something , I don't know or beep ? # ME: like I said before , fifty per cent of the fru f like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it . # ME: And if we're talking about making something easy that sort of goes along with it so it wouldn't be like a random thing to sort of add in . # ME: It would be relevant to like the overall goal I think , # ID: , that'll probably be good . # PM: we have to we have about four minutes left to define our functions . # PM: So let's do that quickly . # PM: so we want something to keep it from getting lost . # PM: And we want we want large buttons for the essential things . # PM: Large , accessible buttons for the essentials . # PM: We want a possibility to get a possibility to get the extra functions . # UI: Which are kind of hidden away in some way or well not hidden but they're not as prominent as the main features . # PM: And we also want it to be fashionable , which I'm not sure if that's a function so much as a # ME: on your coffee table , it's not like an eye sore , that kind of thing . # PM: Any other essential functions that we need ? # PM: Battery ? Do we need a long-life battery ? # ID: Battery battery use . # ID: but I think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really . # PM: But we might as well . # ME: So you never have to change the battery . # UI: We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all . # UI: I suspect the remote control does need a battery , # PM: , I would imagine . # UI: I dunno if you can # PM: Just 'cause it is an electronic device , # ID: I think it does . # ID: I don't I don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without one . # UI: , without the energy , . # ID: But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your iPod . # UI: , that's possible . # ID: You could we could maybe do that instead . # ID: So you don't ha you got like a rechargeable battery . # ID: I dunno , that might contribute to less people losing it too if it stays in one place . # PM: We have to think about space in living-rooms , too , like 'cause they're I mean , would you put it on top of the T_V_ ? # PM: I don't know , just think that's a good idea , we'll keep it . # ID: That's just off the top of my head . # PM: And maybe fun . # PM: Okay . 'kay we're gonna conclude now , has everyone said their functions after the meeting we're gonna each complete a sks a questionnaire and a summaries summary . # PM: I don't know what summarisation . # PM: and then we'll have our lunch break . # PM: After that we have thirty minutes of individual work . # PM: I'll make sure to put up the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides . # PM: If everyone could do that as well , that'd be great . # PM: you each have individual actions , I_ I_D_ Industrial Design you've your components concept , User Interface , the user interface concept , market trend wa watching . # PM: And as per last time you'll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e-mailed to you . # PM: And hopefully , I hope , next time you'll be able to access more of the web site that they seem to tell you that you could . # PM: It's kinda frustrating , # PM: Be sure to note any frustrations or any issues that come up in your in your summary . # PM: Great seeing y'all . # ME: Did you were you able to like put yours in the group folder ? # ID: Yes , I just did that . # ID: Hopefully it is there for people . # PM: Looks like there are looks like there's a second one kind of mine that's that I didn't do , it's from like an earlier project , I think so # ME: Where is that ? # PM: Under the shared folder , I don't know it might not even be under yours as well . # ID: in there we have technical functions presentation , working design presentation and the functional requirements . # ID: At least that's what I have in . # ME: I only have three , I just have like our three . # ID: that's what I have as well , R Rose # PM: You don't have mine ? # ME: but that's 'cause I think yours is in the e-mail separate , like it's not on the server . # ME: But if I open it and then save it , probably will be there . # ME: Oh wait , never mind you can't save it to the # PM: Okay . Well I'll figure that out in the meantime .
# ME: Fourteen twenty six . # PM: Lovely to see you all again . # PM: it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . # PM: our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , I'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close . # PM: these are our minutes from r the functional design . # PM: We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different functions of it . # PM: Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion . # PM: specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , a possibility for extra functions , like a sliding a sliding piece and a long-life battery or a charging station . # PM: now three presentations . # PM: I'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching . # ID: That would be me . # PM: Function F_ eight it . # ID: I'm very excited by this one actually guys I had a lot of fun doing it . # ID: Components design . # ID: This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of . # ID: we need to examine each element separately , but we're designing a full thing , so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole . # ID: The main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as well , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery . # ID: These are all things that we had sort of addressed before , but I'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like . # ID: The case , the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do , there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case . # ID: I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , just keep that in mind , but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic . # ID: That would be our case . # ID: buttons , for buttons we have pushbuttons , which is what Real Reaction uses the most often , but we also have scror scroll wheels , which can have integrated pushbuttons , or we could go all high-tech and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen . # ID: circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , depending on what our other needs are . # ID: And then battery I think is where things get most exciting . # ID: We're talking about long-life batteries here . # ID: we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries , but we also have these options of using a kinetic battery , like are used in high-tech watches , where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up . # ID: so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery . # ID: Or a solar battery , although there are slight complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery . # ID: Or something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights . # ID: Not quite sure what that is , but that's the description that I received , so that's what I'm passing on to you . # ID: So those are our options . # ID: personal preferences that I was thinking through here's what we've been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity . # ID: So if we're going for fashion in our cases , I think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case , probably with a variety of design elements . # ID: Maybe titanium , maybe some wood . # ID: We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials , but that's sort of what I have in mind . # ID: And we wanna go for simplicity . # ID: Probably pushbuttons , but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll wheel , if anyone has anything any ideas on that ? # ID: I mean I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll buttons which are exactly like what they're describing , so that might be something we wanna look into . # ID: And I'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery . # ID: Solar I don't think would be such a good idea , because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light . # ID: But this idea of the kinetic , that you don't have to replace , and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work , I think that m would be a very interesting thing . # ID: But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down . # ID: we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an L_C_D_ . # ID: So I think we want to be aware of not making things overly t technological if they don't need to be , 'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down . # ID: That's what I have for options . # ID: I'd appreciate anyone's input , but that's what I'm seeing for the future of the look of this thing . # ME: Is double-curved like would be like two hands kind of thing ? # ID: I haven't received any specific visuals of this yet . # ME: 'Cause I'm imagining like double-curved is like , you know , like two sides that curve # ID: This is what I'm sort of # ME: and then like one curve would just be like a single vertical-ish kind of looking thing , # ME: but I've no idea . # ID: but I'll let you know as soon as I get any pictures . # ID: I know if we do have a double-curved case , it can't have any titanium in it . # ID: But the titanium , they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme , so that could be quite interesting . # ID: Space-age remote . # PM: Just an interesting marketing kind of element . # ID: Just all things to keep in mind . # ID: That's about all I have to do , guys . # ID: I hope I didn't go through that too quickly . # PM: just a real quick question the weight of these different elements , have you no idea , okay . # ID: no idea , no idea . # ID: I'm assuming that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight , and that a tita titanium is very light , I know , but other than that's really basic , I mean , that's all I have gotten so far . # ID: Any other questions ? # UI: Uh-huh . Don't think so . # ID: I have save this in the shared projects , if anyone wants to look # PM: Thank you , perfect . # ID: and I have c considerable notes on the topic as well , if anyone needs any more information . # PM: if you made notes yourself you can put those on our underneath our oh , in your book , # ID: Just in my notebook , # PM: then don't worry about that . # ID: but if anyone has any specific questions , don't hesitate to email me or something . # PM: now we're concepts of user interface . # PM: This one's so much tighter than the other one . # UI: Alright , so I'm gonna describe the concept of the user interface of this des device . # UI: we've talked about the two essential properties of the user interface . # UI: We want it to be simple and we want it to be fashionable . # UI: we've also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose . # UI: we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control , so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are and make sure that we include that we've included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people . # UI: We have a number of different choices for a design concept and s that's something that I'll show you some examples of , but essentially we need to choose how is this device going to work , how what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device . # UI: once we've chosen a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and the extra functions and the more advanced features . # UI: And of course we also have to make it look cool . # UI: So basically , that's what we don't want . # UI: M we don't want lots of buttons , complicated features . # UI: We want something that looks nice and simple . # UI: Here's a fairly simple device . # UI: This is an iPod from Apple . # UI: I think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons . # UI: It's very minimalistic in its design . # UI: you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen . # UI: the thing I like about this is that it's very quick to access the main features . # UI: you can just about make out that the button three buttons are previous track , next track and play pause . # UI: They're the main the main features of the iPod , the things you will use a all the time . # UI: then if you want to do anything more advanced , you go into the little menu on the L_C_D_ screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and find the more advanced features that you want . # UI: So I think that's a good a good kind of model that we could have . # UI: here's a another example . # UI: This is it's an interesting idea and I think i it looks pretty cool . # UI: it's certainly got novelty value . # UI: it's nice and colourful , it's nice and bright . # UI: it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around . # UI: The buttons are different shapes and you can sort of if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button's which and basically , it's ith it's fun . # UI: I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often . # UI: So you'd need a few buttons to select your favourite channels . # UI: I mean most people , when they watch T_V_ , they have two hundred and fifty channels on their T_V_ and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most . # UI: you have buttons for your favourite channel , changing the volume , which is something you do all the time when you're watching T_V_ , and the button to switch it off , in case you get bored . # UI: other features , things like adjusting the brightness , tuning the T_V_ , I don't know what else you do with a T_V_ . # UI: but these are these are all necessary functions . # UI: you can't have a t there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast , so we need to find a way of including these somehow . # UI: and one other suggestions I'd make is to in is to include in a menu system , a bit like on the iPod . # UI: we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself , or have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device . # UI: And that would allow you to access the advanced features whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often . # ID: So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then ? # UI: I think that's one way to go , I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display , it's nice , because it's it lets you just sort of sit there and st and control your television from your armchair . # UI: There are disadvantages , an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small , 'cause we're I assume we're gonna be making quite a small device . # UI: it would also have to have a kind of backlighting in it , 'cause you ten you tend to watch T_V_ in the dark , but you need to be able to see your L_D_D_ L_C_D_ display . # UI: The alternative is to have a an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control . # UI: a bit like a bit like how they have these digital boxes where you press the buttons and it comes up with your this thing of watch lo what's on each channel . # UI: I mean that that's also a good idea . # UI: it can it does have it's problems as well , if you've got a small T_V_ and you're sitting on the other side of a room , it's hard to read the little text that comes up . # UI: but that's a that's a design decision that we can make . # PM: I do think that one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on . # PM: like favourite channels is applicable , but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it . # ID: Are you are you tak # PM: I know I use that often enough . # ME: but is that separate from what he was saying ? # PM: if it if it was a L_ L_C_D_ on th on the remote , I don't know that you could f that you'd be able to see a # ID: I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what's on . # UI: , that would be one of the features , yes . # PM: 'Cause that would be more specifically a digital box , # UI: But it's something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control the c communication is one way , so you can't have the televisions and information back to the remote control , at least I don't think you can . # PM: now we're moving on to market . Marketing . # ME: Should I plug that in ? # UI: Is that going on ? Okay . # ME: Maybe it's just not # UI: that should be alright , actually . # ME: What F_ do you have to press , I just keep pressing lots of 'em . # ME: I don't know how relevant all of this gonna be . # ME: If anything , the that they gave me . # PM: it's not plugged in , quite in well enough . # ME: Okay , so we're gonna look a little bit at trend watching . # ME: Basically , I was given an executive summary that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year . # ME: first they had people they ranked the important aspects of r remote controls , and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference , but that really , over the next year it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes , so that just goes back to the whole desire of our c Real Reaction company wanting to focus on fashion even though we're stressing , when we're talking , we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea , they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel . # ME: And as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , which is doubly important to the third one , so just to take that weight into account . # ME: The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations . # ME: That would be like if we use something like the space material or the L_C_D_ screen , things like that . # ME: And then ease of use was the third most important , really , no matter what , we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel , according to this . # ME: I don't know how much we agree with that . # ME: And then the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes , shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy , tight material . # ME: And so that brings us to my personal preferences . # ME: Who wants a spongy remote or one with fruit and vegetable padding . # ME: Personally , I don't really think that I want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale , excuse the pun , in a year , so even though this is coming from us as , you know , trend watch , market research , I don't know how much of it we necessarily wanna take away . # ME: Also , considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction , I'm a little hesitant as to like , how these questions may have been worded , and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking . # ME: Personally , like I might reverse it , but if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most . # ME: But it doesn't necessarily need to be a spongy material . # ID: there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though . # ME: I don't have a lot of notes to share if you want them , that pretty much sums it up . So . # PM: do we have any s some questions for this , let's see . # ME: what can I possibly enlighten on ? # PM: do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ? how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or the spongy material at all ? # PM: could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ? # PM: It would be easier on the hands . # ID: If it's latex if it's latexy # PM: It's kind of and then it we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that , # UI: A kind of thing that # ID: An I if th my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside , but that it's covered with the latex , which is spongier and softer on your hands . # ID: there's something to be said , I mean we got that thing earlier from you about not wanting it to R_ repetitive stress injuries and things and # ME: so something , m instead of a necess # ID: something grippable , I mean we don't we don't we don't wanna go spongy , maybe . # ME: I'm thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands , you know , i and I think I'm envisioning more like , you know , the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle , so that it doesn't hurt when you're sitting down for a long time , I'm imagining that sort of thing , I don't know what th that material's called . # ID: , I think that given the list of materials I w I was forwarded it's that seems doable . # ID: could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? # ID: We could colour-co-ordinate them , # PM: F for sure , or maybe like couple main ones being like , I dunno , lemons or strawberries or something . # ID: The buttons could be fruit-shaped . # PM: Could they be smelly ? # UI: I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ? like I dunno , like carrots or something . # PM: Or carrot shaped , # ID: it's quite easy to s shape thing like carrot isn't it ? # PM: Like large button , # ID: Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits . # PM: that's what I was thinking of , # ME: What about the idea of like a round remote ? Instead of like a vertical up and down one . Like in terms of holding it . Like that's a f shape of a fruit . # UI: Kind of like a potato . # ID: It'd be harder to f bu buttons I think . # PM: would you think you do you think you'd be able to hold it ? # ME: Just to tie it in a little . # PM: 'Cause I think the reason they're long is # ID: It'd be harder to press button . # PM: Harder to push . # UI: When you when you use a remote , do you press the buttons with your thumb , usually ? # UI: Or your fingers ? # PM: I usually hold it in one hand . # UI: Or maybe you want something that's shaped like a mobile phone , so you hold it in one hand , and you press the buttons with your thumb . # PM: But then the buttons would have to be very small . # ID: , that's ts how I tend to do it . # PM: Don't you think ? # ID: just thumb-sized . # ME: 'cause otherwise your fingers can't move around . # PM: But I mean in order to get to all of them , # PM: They would have to be within a certain amount of space with each other . # UI: But if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway , then it's not so much a problem , perhaps . # ID: When I'm when I'm pressing buttons on my iPod , that's how I do it , hold it and press the four . # UI: So you hold it in one hand and you press you press the buttons with your thumb # ID: and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel . # UI: And you find that works quite well ? # ME: I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod . # UI: The button on an iPod , is it what is it , is it just four buttons or is it li more like a scroll thing ? # ME: It's like five , # PM: It's a scroll , it's a wheel . # ME: 'cause there's one in the middle . # ID: it would I mean each version of it has been a little bit different , # PM: The one I have doesn't have the four on i like around it , I don't think . # ID: you had one of the in-between ones , when they weren't doing that anymore . # ID: and you press the centre button , that's your all-purpose select button right there . # UI: Oh , I see , right , . # ID: Since it's the one in the centre that's not marked , . # UI: , that's quite a good design . # ME: I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume . # ME: Like just the idea of like those so few buttons for main things , but then how you could go back to the menu and like , I dunno if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual T_V_ . # ME: I kind of am wanting to say on the T_V_ , 'cause if you're changing the brightness , don't you wanna see it happening , kind of ? # ME: And then you could still have that available . # ID: I think an L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice . # UI: I think it could be difficult in practice , Also z , 'cause you would be z looking down at the L_C_D_ screen , than back up at your T_V_ and people don't wanna do that . # PM: we have we've about fifteen minutes left , # ID: we probably have to get going , don't we ? # PM: so I'm gonna continue with my pres presentation . # PM: I've one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things , so I'll just bring that up and show you all before we move on . # ID: Could we could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? In different fruit and vegetable colours , # ME: If I get any more information of fruits and vegetables , I'll let you know . # UI: Like , to make it different fruits . # UI: , it's possible . # PM: and then like the covers could be spongy latex # PM: wherea but the actual model could be titanium . # ID: And you could co-ordinate with your house or whatever . # ID: All these options . # UI: I think maybe th the packaging , it should be like a lemon and the packaging is like the peel . # UI: So instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it , and the remote control's inside . # ME: The iPod packaging is me like was so that was like half the fun . # ME: It's like the way it all comes all cute . # PM: components concept . Energy , chip on print . # ID: Uh-hu oh , oh yes . # ID: I had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get be necessary # PM: That's th this is the agenda they gave me . # PM: can you just explain what that is real quick ? # ID: Alright , decisions , what the deci decisions on energy I'm thinking is based on the battery . # ID: I dunno , what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ? # PM: I think it's awesome . I think it's really cool . # ME: it would t totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries . # UI: I think it's good , as long as we consider the cost and the how reliable it is , # ID: I haven't gotten any # UI: but as far as I know , the technology is good . # ID: any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery , but if we're using a an i a cheaper chip , then it'll even out , I think . # ME: But over time # ID: circuit boards . # ID: I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced . # ID: They're they're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them , and di I think they're quite easily printed on by machine , which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us . # ID: I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions . # ID: I wasn't really given any options , I was just given that this is how they're done . # ID: I can't really tell you . # ID: I can I can tell you a whole lot about how it works . # ID: But I don't know any decisions on # PM: If they're if they're really options . # UI: Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , I think . # UI: it's fairly standard . # PM: then we'll move on to the case . # PM: I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe . # ID: Well okay , here's the here's the thing on the chips that I that I got . # ID: simple , regular , advanced chip on print . # ID: The chip on print includes an infrared sensor , so we don't have to worry about that . # ID: the pushbutton if we're gonna have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , and an L_C_D_ requires advanced . # ID: Do we want a scroll wheel , or do we just want pushbuttons ? # UI: I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . # UI: I mean it might be nice for changing the volume . # PM: It would be nice for changing the volume , but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel . # PM: 'Cause you don't have control over numbers # UI: I don't think it would really work . # UI: you really need buttons for changing a channel . # ID: th it'd be it'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll . # ME: But if you c if you could scroll through the channels , and then the volume would just be # PM: We have five minutes left for the meeting , so . # ME: and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking . # ME: And otherwise , no matter how may buttons we have , we're gonna have like , you know , black with red sticking out and th no it's gonna inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up . # PM: have a scroll for volume ? # ID: or for all those secret functions ? # ID: When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus . # UI: I think , I think a scroll wheel would be nice , but it's not necessary . # ID: So we could either go with a simple or a regular chip , depending and maybe we could table that decision for later . # PM: I think w I think when we go on to the une userface , we're gonna have to decide the interface we're gonna have to decide whether we're gonna have a scroll or not . # ID: let's think about that while we talk about the case . # ID: I'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if spongy is the in thing . # PM: I'm a little I'm a little hesitant about it , because I'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside . # ME: could it be hard , and then something around it ? # ID: everything I've # PM: I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing . # ID: N oh wha what I've what I've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that there's like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex . # ID: Not too thick a layer of latex , just enough to be grippable , like bike handles or anything that you've seen like that . # ID: The inside is hard . # ID: I don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board , I think that that's done for us . # PM: we do want latex . # PM: and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours . # PM: Fruity colours . # PM: let's go to the ufe user interface then we'll come back to the chip I suppose . # ID: and we want a curved case , Or a double-curved ? # PM: we don't really know what the difference is , # ME: I'm thinking curved of some sort . # ID: We don't really know what the difference # PM: interface , the type and the supplements . # PM: push or scroll , Or both ? # UI: And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 'cause then we can have a simple chip and it's simpler , it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button . # UI: So in terms of in terms of economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons . # PM: And if we had a sc an on-screen kind of thing that you could scroll through , like you can use your buttons to scroll through things . # UI: it's fairly simple . # PM: I think that For channel surfing I think a scroll an actual like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , I dunno . # ID: I say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but I have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than a pushbutton , but it's gotta be some more expensive , I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case # PM: Is that okay with you ? # PM: How you feeling ? # ME: And let's like see if we get anything else . # ME: I mean I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , it's more just to give it a different kind of look , but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool , then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel . # PM: It might be cool enough . # PM: Okay , so we're gonna go with type pushbuttons , and then supplements , how are we gonna do that ? # UI: what do you mean by supplements , exactly ? # PM: I assume that's what else we're gonna like h ha the additional buttons we can use . # PM: So we're gonna have like a menu button , so that we can access on-screen things then ? # PM: we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through . # ID: what are what are our buttons gonna be ? # UI: volume , favourite channels , and menu . # ID: So like one through five , or # ME: Like a radio type sorta situation ? # UI: like , a bit like radio presets . # PM: Pre-set channels and then we're gonna need numbers one through zero , # UI: we wouldn't even need the numbers . # UI: I think maybe numbers seems is kind of old-fashioned . # PM: but in order to pre-set a cha I guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through . # UI: you can just and you need some kind of , I dunno , sort of up down kind of button , # UI: but the volume control could double for that , for example . # PM: finishing the meeting now . # PM: our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . # PM: You'll get specific instructions from your personal coach . # PM: did we decide on a chip ? # PM: Let's go with a simple chip ? # PM: Thank you everyone . # PM: these are already in our shared folder , so . # UI: Clay . I wasn't expecting that .
# PM: welcome to our detailed design meeting . # PM: I'm pretty excited . # PM: Let's start it's approximately fifteen forty or something like that . # PM: the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then I'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we d discussed , then we'll have the prototype presentation and a look at the evaluation criteria . # PM: We'll look at the finances and finally a do a production evaluation and close . # PM: starting off with the last the last one , I don't have it here , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use a kinetic battery , we want to use a simple chip , because we're not gonna need a shuffle , we're gonna need a scroll , we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved and we're using push buttons with a supplement of an on-screen menu . # PM: And it sounded like we had set like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels . # PM: Let's do the look and feel design presentation first . # UI: do you wanna start ? # ID: Right , well we made three different prototypes and I guess we'll start with this one . # ID: we have our colours not are not fixed , but this is the general shape . # ID: you hold it sort of either like this in your left hand or you switch it over and it's easily adaptable to either hand . # ID: You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone , or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand , or even I mean there's a whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger . # ID: we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big . # ID: We have our up and down buttons , which are also gonna be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here . # ID: If you push if you're just pushing these normally , they're the menu buttons , if the volume buttons rather . # ID: If you press select once , they become channel changing buttons . # ID: If we press select three times , the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your T_V_ channel choices shows up , and you have your five presets down here . # ID: if people wanna grab hold of that , see how it feels in your hand . # ID: That's our number one prototype . # ID: do you wanna present the potato , # PM: like a little lightning in it . # ID: or shall I present the Martian ? # PM: The little lightning bolt in it , very cute . # UI: We call that one the rhombus , # PM: The v the rhombus ? # ID: That's the rhombus , yep . # UI: this one is known as the potato , how can I present it ? # UI: It's an ergonomic shape , so it fits in your hand nicely . # UI: it's designed to be used either in your left hand or in your right hand . # UI: I've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one . # UI: the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume . # UI: So you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here . # UI: the red ones are for changing channels , channel up and channel down and that's moves between your favourite channels that you've selected . # UI: this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu and when you're working in the on-screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button to select and that's basically it , that's the potato . # UI: that would be one of your channels , basically , so like channel zero would be t to switch the machine off , # PM: we turn it off . # ME: Could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button ? # UI: not really , it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your T_V_ off . # ID: If you pressed and held it maybe . # UI: , that that'd be one way of doing it , . That'd work , . # ME: If you like held it down , that would be on off . # ID: On off , that's a possibility , . # ID: And then finally we have the Martian or the pear , either way . # ID: it's a bit different , just a little bit more of a creative feel . # ID: you have the on off toggle stem on the top . # ID: We have the five preset seeds . # ID: And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional , you have your channel changing , volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle . # ID: that's for your consideration as well , plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up . # ID: We figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if I made the bot the bottom flat . # ME: what's the yellow one in the middle , # ID: the menu select button . # PM: Very interesting . # PM: I think that one's my favourite . # UI: So that's So that's our three prototypes . # UI: basically , in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what kind of button layout we want , how many buttons , and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device , like label on the buttons or put a brand name or a logo on it or whatever . # ID: We were we were thinking that normally we'd go for fruity colours , but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote , so m maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down , maybe with less contrasts on it . # ID: something still a little bright to make it hard to lose , but # UI: but we don't want it to look like a kids' toy . # PM: that was one thing that we brought up over email . # PM: I don't know if you picked up your email , but the f the feature that we considered for it not getting lost . # ID: Right . Well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it it's not just like another piece of technology around your house . # ID: It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen . # ID: So we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss # ME: But if it's like under covers or like in a couch you still can't see it . # PM: It's really Would it be very difficult to just have an external device that like I dunno , you tape to your to your T_V_ that when you press it a little light beep goes off ? # PM: Do you think that would be conceptually possible ? # UI: I think it would be difficult technologically , because if your if your remote's lost it's probably under the settee and in that case you can't you can't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it , s so it's I'm not quite sure how it would work # PM: That's true , mm 'kay . # UI: and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else . # UI: ho how many times do you really , seriously lose your remote control and would a device like that actually help you to find it ? # ID: There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something , but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon . # PM: Okay , that's a fair evaluation . # PM: Getting lost . # PM: we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now . # PM: 'cause well , the designs are very bright , so you're right , they're gonna stick out , # ID: So d do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality ? . # ME: I feel like this is simil or it's sort of what already exists so if we're trying to think of something sort of like new and fun , even though this is like what you're init I'm initially drawn to , just 'cause it's like comfortable and like not different . # ME: I sort of like this one , I don't know why , it just it's like small but still sort of like cute looking , I dunno . # ME: But I also like the b the side buttons on that one , like I think that's kind of neat . # ME: But I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on . # PM: Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ? # PM: So then w we wouldn't have to have like a dual function ? # UI: , it's possible , . # ID: that's good , that's good . # UI: Put an extra the button on . # PM: why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria , if you've developed some ? # ME: I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for . # ME: That was I was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do , but let me I have to like write something on the whiteboard , so . # PM: Do you need this or just write on the white board ? # ME: I actually don't have like a PowerPointy thing , 'cause I think it would be redundant . # PM: It's kind of like a joystick kind of thing , you know , kinda push it . # PM: Maybe a little smaller than that . # ID: I kinda like it . # ID: That's hard to miss . # UI: It makes look more fruity as well . # PM: Oh it does , it's kind of like # UI: It's like a deformed foot , I dunno . # PM: There it could have a stem like that , 'cause I do l kind of like the stem . # PM: It almost helps you ge keep a grip too , 'cause it goes in between fingers . # ID: Interesting . # PM: I like this one . # PM: Variety of colours are nice . # ID: is that where people are leaning then , the potato ? # ID: I like the idea of the # PM: I think I'm leaning towards the potato . # ID: that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one . # PM: I am worried about like using a menu . # PM: in that withing menus there are submenus , and so how do you get back to the main menu ? # ID: on the iPod , for example , you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level . # PM: But that has a menu button separate from a select button , whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button ? # UI: This is , it's the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices . # UI: You find the choice that you want and you press you press the right button . # PM: Could these be used for going to submenus # UI: , so they're used for going into and out of your submenus , . # ID: maybe it can be one of those , if you press down and hold for two seconds , then it brings you back one level or something . # PM: Okay . Well , as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it still , # ME: Okay , so which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our s necessities , the yellowy one is that # ID: The potato ? Are we leaning towards the potato ? # ME: we can obviously change it after we go through each different one . # ME: basically what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to . # ME: what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately rank each of the following things and then I'll tabulate an average just to make sure that it does meet that . # ME: we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true and seven being not true at all , or false , if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria . # ME: we can do this one first . # ME: First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel objective . # ME: So like in my opinion the for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so I'm gonna say it's like a three . # ME: That's just my opinion . # ME: What does each of you # PM: I kind of think it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two . # ME: give it a number , # PM: I will give it a one . # ID: I dunno if it's creative . # ID: I dunno if fancy is the word I would use . # ID: I dunno if any of them are fancy I'd say two , because c unique . # UI: I'll go for two . # ME: And two , awesome . # ME: Alright , and same sort of scale for functionality , is it functional ? # ME: I think it's extremely functional , I'm gonna give it a one . # UI: I think it's functional , it's also pretty basic , so I'll give it a two . # PM: I think it'll get everything done , I think it might be a little confusing at first , I don't know if that's gonna be a later one . # ME: there's some other ones , I will address that , # PM: then I'm gonna give it a two . # ME: Awesome , we wanna know next if it's technologically innovative . # PM: Did you give a functional ? # ME: she said it was one . # ME: is it technologically innovative ? # ME: Mm . Not really , I mean not so much , 'cause we don't have the L_C_D_ screen , we don't have fancy chip . # ME: Other than what it looks like , I dunno if it's really # PM: the kinetic battery . # ID: In the battery , that's it . # ME: kinetic battery is a big one , # ID: How many people would notice that , though ? # PM: But they'll notice it after like a year , # ME: but we know it's there . # PM: they'll be like hey , I have never changed the battery . # ME: And if it's made of like latex , that whole idea , that's pretty cool . # PM: Mm . Just the material . # ME: I'll give it a three . # ME: 'Cause it we could've picked a lot of features that would've made it really # ID: I would say that it's like fancy versus creative it's different . # ID: But does that equal innovative ? # ID: I'll give it a three . # ME: Everyone else ? # UI: I'd say it's technologically it's not it's not unique , I mean it's just it is just pushbuttons , so I I'd give it a four . # PM: Think I'm gonna go with the four as well . # PM: I really like that kinetic battery though . # ME: Next , is it easy to use ? # ME: Just so you know , easy to learn will be separate , so don't overlap them . # ME: I think it's really easy to use . # ME: I'll give it a two . # ID: I'll give it a one . # ID: Pretty hard to mess up . # ME: we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality and if indeed it's made of latex or rubber I it's spongy all the way . # UI: I wonder if it bounces when you drop it . # ID: that you couldn't it'd be harder to break , harder to lose . # PM: 'Cause there would be less impact maybe , . # ME: Iain , what do you give it ? # UI: I'd give it a one . # ME: Alright and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables ? # ME: is it gonna be yellow ? # ID: It it might be , 'cause that's our corporate colour , isn't it ? # PM: That's right , corporate colour , we didn't keep that in # ID: We might wanna keep it yellow . # PM: I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in and the outside in yellow , that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that's more fruity . # ME: but if you had like a silvery kind of white or something . # PM: and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something ? # ID: If we had a yellow # PM: Fruity , so fruity . # ME: Alright , so I think it it's # ID: it was inspired by the potato , so I think it's pretty fruity . # PM: I think i it's kind of mangoey too . # UI: Mangoey is better , . # UI: I like mangoes . # ME: I'm giving it a one the mango put me over . # ID: That's a much more trendy than a potato # ME: What are what's everyone's numbers ? # ME: Alright , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ? # ME: Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons , that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most . # ME: I think we really took that into account a lot , so I'm gonna give it a one . # ME: Did you say one , Rose ? # ME: also we talked earlier about R_S_I_ and wanting to prevent any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing . # ME: Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account ? # ME: I think I'll give it a two , 'cause I almost feel like no matter what you do , something is gonna happen . # PM: It's gonna be hard . # PM: And if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing , # ME: worth the risk , I think . # PM: I like how it fits in the hand though so I I'd go with a two . # ID: I'll say two as well . # ID: Because older people that aren't used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first , # ME: Alright , awesome . # ME: And the ease of learning it . # ME: I know you were saying that you're a little bit nervous about that , I dunno . # ME: It sort of reminds me of the iPod . # ME: I just got mine , I still haven't read the instruction book and I'm doing okay , so and I'm not good at learning technology . # ME: So I'll give it a two . # ID: The menu system and the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing , but I think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you'll have it afterwards . # ID: So I'd I think I'd give it a two I guess . # UI: I think it it's probably a little harder then most remotes to learn , because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are # UI: and that could take a bit of learning at first , once you've , once you'd learned how to use it , I think it is a lot easier . # UI: So I'd give it a four . # PM: I think I'd give it a four too . # PM: It's a pretty high learning curve , it'll be easy once you've done it , # ME: Alright , also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we're not addressing that at all , # PM: I think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour , # ME: Okay , so in terms of not losing it , do you think that on a scale of one to seven , how easy or hard is it to lose ? # ME: I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a four , 'cause I think that you can still if it's in between somewhere where you can't see it , you're kind of not gonna find it , but anywhere else it's gonna stand out . # ID: I'd say I'd give it a three , I guess it depends on how tidy you are normally . # PM: Mm I'd give it a four . # UI: I'll give it a five 'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that , . # ME: Alright , we also said simplicity , how w how well does it address just being simple ? # ID: Simple to use or simple in design ? Do you know ? # ME: I think overall , 'cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion , so those are the next two things we're gonna look at . # ME: Separate from fancy , like that sort of thing . # ME: it like wants to be simple but it's not like totally simple , so I'm gonna give it a two . # ID: I'm give it a three I guess . # UI: I'll give it a two . # ME: Alright , and fashionable ? # PM: It's totally fashionable . # PM: I'd give it a one . # ME: It's hot , I mean it's a mango , come on . # ME: I mean how fashionable can you make a remote ? # ME: I think it's bringing technology and fashion together real really well . # ID: I don't think it's quite as fashionable as my robot remote # PM: I do like the little Martian one . # ID: or alien or whatever he was . # ME: the toggle on off switch , it's really appealing . # ME: And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal , that whole thing ? # ME: Just that it would se serve our audience . # ME: I don't see why not . # PM: I think as long if we offer in a in at least three different colour arrangements . # PM: So I'll give it a two . # ME: Alright , did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we didn't talk about ? # PM: we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo , so let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an R_R_ on it . # ID: Shall we I think all of them should have an R_R_ . # PM: All of them should have R_R_ , # ME: And so we're gonna do that , so it will address it , # PM: now we're gonna look at finances . # PM: I have an Excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost , so let me exit out of this first . # PM: Let me one more space . # PM: Gonna zoom in real quick . # PM: We're using kinetic battery , # ID: we're n using kinetic , . # PM: and we're having one per One , okay . # PM: electronics . # ID: Simple , simple rather . # ID: uh double-curved . # UI: Guess it's double-curved . # UI: It is pretty curvy . # PM: It's very curvy , so okay . # ID: I never did get a picture of those so I don't really know . # ID: Our case material supplements we just skipped by them . # ME: don't we need plastic , and # ID: we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed . # ID: The supplement is # ME: Provided , okay . # ID: I guess it was rubber rather than latex . # PM: I mean the rubber . # ME: It was rubber and special colour , Do we have more than one special colour ? # PM: we're using we're gonna need at least two special colours . # UI: Special colours , isn't it ? # ID: I don't know what the se the basic colour is though . # PM: I dunno where it # ME: but we know that we're having at least three colours , # PM: So let's y say three . # ID: are we talking about on each colour combination or are we , you know , like we'll have yellow and black . # ID: Is that two special colours ? # ID: Or or is white and black , then two more or # PM: I thought that would be under yours . # ID: . I guess it's three , # PM: We'll just say three . # PM: Maybe the R_R_ will be in colour as well , # PM: Interface , we're doing push buttons . # PM: And how many buttons do we have ? # UI: We've got five . # ID: Six , with the power . # PM: Anything else ? # ID: we'll do we wa Are the buttons in special colour , special f I didn't get information on # PM: buttons oh , so . So the case material will just have one colour , but then the buttons will be in special colours ? # ID: does it but if we're making multiple varieties of this is where I'm getting confused . # PM: We're saying per unit . # ID: per unit , okay , okay . # PM: so each unit will only have one colour on their # ID: Alright , and each button s # PM: but the case is could have up to thr I mean the buttons could ea could be up to three colours , 'cause that how it's designed there . # ME: I like it like that . # PM: Special form ? # PM: They're all kind of just push button , # ID: I think they're fine . # PM: Special material ? # ID: Material , we want them rubber as well probably , . # PM: I have to do it per button , # ID: No , I don't think so . # ID: I think they're if they're all gonna be rubber then it that's what it matters . # ME: 'cause it wouldn't make sense otherwise , 'cause for the whole mat case material it's only one . # ME: I mean it's two to make it rubber . # ME: Oh wait , so maybe . # PM: Thirteen point seven . # PM: what can we reduce ? # ID: let's have our buttons all be one colour . # ME: Mm , I kind of like the buttons . # PM: Let's see what that would do . # PM: It's only gonna bring us down to thirteen point three anyway . # PM: are we sure this is double-curved ? # PM: Maybe it's single-curved , # ID: We have no idea . # PM: we have no idea . # ID: I dunno , I didn't get any pictures . # ID: It's single curved . # ME: It's single curved . # PM: it's not the it's the kinetic battery that's kind of expensive , but we have a simple chip , single curve , case material is rubber and it's a special colour , but that's important . # PM: Six buttons we have to have six buttons . # ID: That is important . # ID: How did it get more expensive , what did you just change ? # ID: It was it was thirteen and now it's fifteen . # PM: No , okay , maybe not . # PM: I don't know what just happened . # PM: Now it's twelve . # UI: What was our target price again ? # PM: Twelve point five . # ID: Twelve point five . # UI: Twelve point five . # UI: So we're just about there . # PM: So we're okay , I think . # ID: We're all set then . # PM: Okay , we're all set . # PM: I saved that to our big shared folder , so you know . # PM: back to agenda . # PM: are the are the costs under twelve fifty Euro ? # PM: Let's move on to the project evaluation . # PM: Project process . Satisfaction with for example the room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , the means , any new ideas found . # PM: So I guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project , the information we got on the news , how we used it , if we were able to , you know , use our creativity with the information , how well I guess I led it , the how well we worked together as a team , the digital pens , the whiteboard . # ID: I felt very creative . # UI: I think we've been successful # ID: I enjoyed making the prototypes . # UI: in that we've achieved almost all of the design goals that we've set and we've come up with a finished project and we just about got cost . # ID: I think we could've done even better with a little bit more information , like what's a single-curved case , how many colours , what do colours count things , but given what we had I think that we did we did really well . # ID: I think we worked together pretty well . # ME: if I'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables , maybe we could've taken that into account . # ID: But the fruits and vegetables , they really my creativity , so . # ME: I know , I really did , the whole mango idea was great . # ID: Do you think we could # ME: I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally , like its heaviness , and like just being so conscious of like turning the pages , I dunno . That was a bit of a distraction . # ME: That was the last one , like I chose not to do a PowerPoint 'cause I didn't think it made sense to , so I liked that I had the option to do that and just to take my own notes and that whole sort of thing . # PM: I think we all made very significant contributions , I don't think anybody dominated it , which I thought was really good , like each of us was able to like each of you had your information and I tried to facilitate it without like taking over , I like our little finished products . # ID: Can we market this as the mango remote ? # ME: They're funny . # ME: I kind of want one . # ID: Should we have that somewhere on the packaging ? # ID: I have a little R_R_ . # ME: I'm trying to think of a good pun that I could add there . # PM: let's think of it like a little jingle . # ME: I like the R_R_ , that's gonna be etched in . # ID: Hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point but it's quite a useful little gadget . # ID: All thanks to Iain for the design of that one . # ID: Mm . What did we find for new ideas ? # PM: new ideas found ? # ID: People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables . # PM: Or or at least be c p creative enough to think of toggle switches mm etcetera . # ID: I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them . # PM: I'm so excited . # ME: I didn't even know they existed . # ID: I knew you can get watches that had them , like really quite expensive watches that just never need a battery , 'cause you're always moving your wrist . # ID: But in other things , I think it'd be really good . # PM: , that's awesome . # PM: Are the costs within the budget ? # PM: Is the project evaluated ? # PM: there's the final questionnaire and meeting summary . # PM: this is the great product kids , I think we've created something really interesting and that we have a market for it , especially if we can produce it at twelve point three which we hope Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the final results # ME: Real Reaction . # PM: I do like the Martian remote . # PM: If we could choose more than one , that would be my second choice . # ME: that would definitely be my second choice . # PM: Although the tog toggle I'm afraid I would # UI: Let's all let's all go for the yellow # ME: I would break it . I would break it . # PM: I think I would break it . # ID: It started because I wanted to have it as st as a stem # UI: Break the stem off . # ID: and then alright , so # ID: Is it started as a pear , but then it started looking more and more like a Martian when I put the # ME: Kind of looks like a penguin , like with no eye . # ID: Take me to your leader . # PM: , it's kind of a penguin . # ME: I like that it stands up . # ID: maybe I should market it to some remote control company now . # UI: That was bound to happen.$ # ID: poor little thing . # PM: congratulations . # PM: . Anything else to say ? # ME: Nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over , # ME: its all timed . # PM: anybody have I got more master classes , anybody else wanna like take a master's class ? # ID: It's really funny that you got spam in your work emails . # PM: but check it out . # PM: So like there are all these like links , they don't go anywhere . # PM: But all that you need to keep in mind your knowledge management . just wanna make sure you do . # ME: No the first one that you sent like I didn't realise that it was a joke and I was like why did she send this to us ? # ME: It's very it's very work relevant , 'cause people send spam a lot . # PM: Yes definitely # PM: I'm very sad that I didn't get any links to the corporate website . # ME: here you can you can view . # ID: what did I get through the corporate website ? # ID: It's just inspiration about circuit boards . # ME: You can just see what's up . # ME: it's really deep . # ME: Takes a little while to get excited to load . # ME: the Excel thing is pretty cool . # ID: , that is pretty neat . # ME: like , basically # PM: it's one of my favourite programs . # ME: it's like inspiration , basically I'm gonna give you two sentences on fashion and that kind of thing , You didn't miss out that much . # ID: my inspiration from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit , talking about circuit boards . # ID: I learned a lot actually . # ID: I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to . # ME: This one was cooler . # ME: I got a whole table and everything . # ID: Now I have all about circuits and chips and transponders I wrote it all down , because I thought it would be relevant , like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control , but then they're like , you don't actually need this you just need to talk about the case . # ME: That's like mine it was like , would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen or a multifunction remote control ? # ME: And then it didn't have like any kind of table , awesome , I'm glad they asked that question and didn't report the result . # PM: I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing . # ID: It's really interesting though . # PM: We had a lot of the otherwise the technology today was kinda cool . # ID: That was really neat how I got emails # UI: We didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much . # PM: Although I don't see how we could have very l at least for me # ID: If I'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case , the different looks of the case , I would have probably drawn them up , # ME: 'Cause we weren't like voting on anything and I think usually , like whiteboards are good , you know like crossing out ideas , or like if we had like a brainstorming period . # ID: we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it , but with only four people it doesn't really make sense . # ME: But I thought we were good orally . # PM: And with and with the PowerPoint that we can all look at , like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint # ID: I think if you had a larger group # PM: as that's not as necessary to have . # ME: And these might've made us more willing to like take notes than to like write up them here , 'cause we all needed them separately , kind of on the whiteboards in this room . # ID: Because we're all gonna be working in different places . # ID: if we were all gonna stay in here all the time , then having the notes up on the whiteboard would've been alright , but everyone needs their own , like specific notes , I guess . # PM: when you were creating your prototypes here , did you work together or did you like do separate projects ? # UI: we worked together , but we were making we sort of made different shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work , and how we could like improve on the on the design . # ID: it was a bit of both really , we just kind of started out by each taking a colour of clay and just fooling around with it and I came up with that rhombus shape and he came up with the sort of potatoey , mangoey shape , and then just went from there really . # ID: well done with the management , I felt well managed . # UI: I think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time , # PM: It's kinda fun . # UI: and second we actually we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings . # ID: That happened to me all the time though . # UI: I know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided . # UI: But I think here we got we got clear and decisive points at the end of the meetings , so that we knew where to go on from there . # ID: I was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting we didn't really have enough information to make firm decisions , but we were able to do it regardless , I'm not usually a very decisive person , so it helped to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes . # PM: This is what we'll do . # PM: I found that we did we could have used another five or ten minutes sometimes in the meetings . # ID: Especially last time , # UI: , for some of the meetings , . # PM: I think the last time we had a lot of information , but at the same time not quite enough , you know what I mean , like we couldn't answer every single question . # ID: And I felt the first two meetings , that I was coming in with no information , and not sort of made me really like , ooh I don't know , throwing together PowerPoint out of no information and then last time it was like the opposite . # ID: I had so much information and so much to talk about . # PM: It was interesting what came out like later , like as I was doing the when I was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me , that more points came out from your presentation even . # PM: I'm a little I am a little disappointed that we didn't do a something for losing the remote , because that was kind of a big point . # ID: that was something in order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and things like # ME: the problem was , even when we just were creating from the Excel file , there wasn't like a option to select to somehow have it included , so there was no we could be like , it has it included . # ID: I think we were # ME: There was no way for us to have # PM: Considered the re # ME: written down that it was really there . # ID: I think we were just getting overenthusiastic with the task . # PM: it's interesting that they # ID: I think we really got into it , I mean I got into it as the day went on and I got really like , ooh I'm designing a remote control , I dunno if that's just me , # PM: It was interesting though that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration with losing their remote and yet they didn't provide us with information to we weren't provided with information to discuss that . # PM: I know that like people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it and it'll beep , but I but I'm sure that would require some kind of technology I just don't know what it is , # ID: I think there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things so you won't lose them . # ID: I dunno . I mean we were talking about it and like i in my household at least , there's only about two places that the remote is ever 'cause there's only one T_V_ there's only like three chairs . # ME: That's like saying you're never gonna lose your keys , and I always do , anyway . # ME: You'll lose 'em in your pocket , you just will forget that or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember , there's always ways to lose things . # PM: it depends on how organised you are personally , # ID: or like I guess what the setup of the house is too . # ID: But , I mean I am notorious for losing my keys , I guess I've just never lost the remote . # ID: I put my keys in the refrigerator the other night and couldn't find them . # ID: 'Cause I was putting groceries away . # ID: You you're taking stuff from a bag and putting them in the refrigerator and then go back to my room . # ID: Can't get in , look all around the kitchen . # ID: Definitely in the vegetable drawer . # ME: I always do that , leaving it in my coat , and then like using a different coat . # ID: But I guess it's 'cause we don't carry remotes around that much . # ME: Can't really take it into the other room . # ID: Maybe with our little robot one we could've had him have a robot , alien , pear , whatever he is , have a little voice like , I am located a G_P_S_ system , internal G_P_S_ . # PM: We should make one that walks by itself . # ID: Although if it's sitting still for too long . # ME: That really could get up and walk away . # PM: Or or like some crazy like electro-magnet , that you push it and it'll go zoom to the T_V_ and stick there . # ID: Or little Or just a wheel , you know . # ID: Just if you you'd have a remote for your remote , that'll . # PM: but if you could attach them to the T_V_ , then you can . # ID: All kinds of possibilities . # PM: I'm just trying to update my minutes . # PM: I decided to you know how I sent you the email saying that PowerPoint minutes will be complimentary , rather than like repeating them . # PM: Just gonna make I'm making full minutes , so that it'll include all of the agenda and all that . # PM: 'Cause that seems a little more useful . # ID: 'Cause you've had like the most typing and organising to do . # PM: But I didn't have like information to sloth through either , so # ID: , I guess How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you , every meeting . # PM: Most of it , I added slides , I added a couple slides each time , but that was about it . # ID: I didn't even think about adding slides , 'cause I would just get slides with titles on them and fill them all didn't even think about adding more . # PM: the thing was they would provide y an agenda with s like several points , but it wouldn't have a slide for each point . # PM: And that's the only way I remember that I need to go other that point . # PM: I know personally when I do PowerPoint , that's what I do and so I had it once , even if it was just like the title of it , like the three presentations , and I would do your three . # ME: You have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like # PM: The slogan on it ? # ID: No , no , definitely not . # ME: 'Cause I was like , it could go around the outside . # ID: No , I don't think we need to # PM: I think we just need the R_R_ , # ID: I think the R_ and R_ , especially if the yellow and black one . # ME: Is it yellow and blue ? # ID: Or yellow and blue . # ID: Lemme go to the web page . # PM: I was just kinda going by the web page , 'cause they didn't give me any clear , like yellow , grey , or . # ME: I guess it is black , grey . # ME: Grey is better than black , doesn't look so bumblebeeish . # PM: I don't really like yellow in general . # ME: now I understand the random like newsclippings . # ID: Finish meeting now . # PM: Wasn't it interesting that I thought it was interesting that our market marketing expert did not agree with the marketing the marketing choices , you know , like that was a bit of a conflict . # ME: I just feel like if you're really doing like a really big market evaluation , you wouldn't just have like one set of source , it's kind of an they were so not backed up , it would just be a sentence like we did a survey , this is what people said . # PM: People are stupid . # ID: I guess it i it sort of a grey , isn't it ? # ID: Yellow and grey , but then the slogan's in blue . # ME: we got some grey and we got some blue buttons , we're good . # ID: we don't have the right colour clay anyway . # PM: Maybe , like I don't know . That could always be . # ID: we're not , sadly , going to actually be producing this , so . # ME: If they ever come out with potato # ID: Potato mango shaped remotes . # ME: I'm gonna have to # PM: I'm claiming it intellectual property . # ID: I can't believe a whole day is gone . # ID: I don't feel like it's been that long . # ID: Get sucked in . # ID: Mm I haven't gotten questionnaire eight yet .
# ME: Are you sure I got it all head's kinda small . # UI: How're we placed in terms of the alright . # ID: Guess I should probably try to sit up straight . # ID: I think mine's fallen off . # UI: It fell That's why . # ME: I guess it's gonna be hard to drink coffee . # PM: Right , so I'm just gonna start this PowerPoint real quick . # ME: Very official . # PM: I kinda like this I'm kinda getting into it . # PM: Right . So just to kick off the meeting basically so we're working now for a real reaction , this is so it Just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . # PM: We're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another then we're gonna start talk a little bit about tool training . # PM: Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard . # PM: we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up . # PM: I guess you know game or something in real life so basically I want to I'm just gonna you got of course you can discuss that , I'm thinking about proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell . # PM: if you say something about marketing , right , sorted , # ME: You're just gonna believe me , we'll go from there . # PM: obvi if you guys if at the same time if you like logically if something doesn't like if I'm we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book you know you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X_ obviously go with it . # PM: I mean we'll discuss it but I'm not gonna ask do you know that or it seems like # PM: yeah exactly 'cause we're what we're sort of role playing you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well . # PM: And that's the same for your when we do introductions I mean and you talk about your background you know have fun , you know maybe you went to you know maybe i you're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that , why not , you know you can this is you know I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it . # PM: So are you guys okay with that does that seem logical ? # ID: Oh , that's fine . # PM: I guess that we're totally we're making a remote control which is thrilling but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model I dunno if you guys had time to check the in real life I dunno if you guys checked the corporate website . # PM: we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something . # PM: So basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly slick sleek kind of way . # PM: way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics . # PM: And that's where I'm gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the other designer that I can't remember , the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ the Industrial Designer hey right on alright , getting into it # PM: to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be you're g you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know X_ and Y_ at the same time . # PM: And then we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you know like I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that . # PM: and so we'll work up from there and then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can hope for and what way to go take the take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible to try t of sync it all up . # PM: So that's the detailed design . # PM: So it's a three stage kind of thing . # PM: right so for now just for th the white board basically just to get used to it , I haven't tried it yet either I'm just gonna start and mm carry like five remotes around and just write down I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my desert discs you know if you if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five C_D_s along with you name one of them that you could , not all five , if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could . # PM: we skipped introductions . # PM: I'm a excellent Project Manager . # PM: I'm Marty , I went to uni at U_C_ Santa Barbara and I'm here working on a P_H_D_ in psychology . # ME: I'm Sarah , I went to Michigan , and I'm here doing cultural studies and I'm the Marketing Manager or something . # ME: Expert . Expert . # PM: Don't play yourself down . # UI: I once upon a time studied in Victoria and I am the User Interface Designer . # ID: I'm Nathan , I'm from California , and I'm here doing a Masters degree in social anthropology . # PM: Where did you go to uni Nathan ? # PM: brilliant . Cool . # PM: My little brother goes there . # PM: Right so desert island discs . # ME: do we have to wait for you to write it down or are you gonna tell us ? # ME: I'm waiting to know . # PM: I'm just gonna write a couple of 'em down . # PM: See I'm a big music fan I don't know if you guys are , I'm assuming everybody likes music to some lesser or greater extent there's some other options , if you're a T_V_ slut # PM: like I am like Smallville terrible television show but I happen to love it , # ME: Oh , Smallville . # PM: it's rubbish but I love it . # ME: I went to high school with Tom Willing actually . # PM: T the main c the main character ? # PM: Is he a wanker ? # ME: Hell of a soccer player but a total bastard nonetheless . # PM: He looks really tall , like he's gotta be like six . # ME: He is a big guy . # PM: okay so I really like Jeff Buckley . # PM: You guys heard of Jeff Buckley ? # PM: that's cool 'cause like not very many people have . # PM: and oh well I might as well throw a British person in there you can't go wrong with Radiohead . # PM: Okay so it really works just like a pen only makes noises I think . # PM: It's kinda weird . # ME: Interesting . # PM: you're like press and it's . # PM: Alright so whoever wants to get up next , you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want . # ME: I guess I'll go next then . # ME: Don't wanna lose all my mikes , plugged in here . # ME: This is basically just pen practice Oh you're much taller than me so I'm gonna write down here . # ME: Right now I'm listening to a lot of somebody nobody's ever heard of , Chris Bathgate , local Michigan folk singer , really lame what else did I bring with me ? # ME: Probably classical , to totally geek it out , # ME: And my family guy D_V_D_s but we don't need to write that one down . # PM: Isn't h has h do you watch the new season ? # ME: Are you getting it online , # PM: I think I'm gonna start downloading it # ME: or is it on sky ? # ME: , that'd be nice . # UI: Think I'm just gonna put down one C_D_ . # UI: Afro beat orchestra , very cool . # PM: Afro beat orchestra ? # UI: they like fifteen members from Brooklyn . # UI: and I'm hoping to go to the concert in Belgium , in Brussels in April first . # UI: It's supposed to be in Brussels anyways . # UI: thing I love about Edinburgh # ME: I didn't even read those . # ME: I shouldn't admit that . # PM: That's what a PowerPoint presentation is for . It's they're designed specifically to ignore . I it's th brilliant . # ME: It's the five by five , I can't read that much . # PM: yes okay I see that . # ME: oh it's so horrible . # PM: Street pizza . # PM: It's so brilliant . # PM: I've seen more urine in this city than ever before , # UI: I just came from Glasgow # UI: and I'm happy to say that there's the there's the same quantity approximately . # ID: There's more vomit there . # PM: It's so minging . # PM: I'm going local . Going local . # ME: Slide it in there . # PM: I have to be here for three years so I might as well get the terminology right . # ME: I've already got more than I can keep track of . # ME: And I'm gonna go home next week and everyone's gonna be like oh my God you're turning into one of those people , # PM: have you been home yet ? # PM: They'll be like , say something British , and you're like oh shut up family . # ME: Oh it should be interesting . # ME: Wait until I tell them I'm not coming back . # ME: They're gonna love that one . # PM: you s you're gonna stay here ? # ME: Or at least get a work visa for a while and then decide . # PM: Bad religion ? # ID: that's the music I grew up listening to . # ME: now I can think of so many other ones . # ME: That's how it works . # ID: Something I miss about my hometown . # PM: I miss coffee . # ID: that cost less than eight Pounds . # ME: Any thing that are like free . # PM: Where are you from in California by the way ? # ID: I grew up in San Diego , # PM: Did you really ? # PM: I'm from San Diego as well . # ID: But really I last lived in San Francisco , I haven't lived in Cali I haven't lived in southern California since I was eighteen . # PM: Going to s like North Carol I'm sorry you just can't get a better burrito than what's available in the s in San Diego . # ID: It's different . # ID: 'Cause in San Diego th the tortillas are cooked on the grill and in northern California they steam them . # ME: It must make all the difference . # ID: , it really does . # PM: it's i there's other things too there's you just can't place it I when I went to school in the U_ in Santa Barbara which is central California the Mexican food is okay , it's just not good and it's like two bucks , like literally two bucks for this massive good call on that . # ID: Where you from in San Diego ? # PM: just literally just metropolitan San Diego , I live like five minutes from the zoo . # PM: North Park actually if you want to get real specific . # ID: my grandparents lived on thirty second . # ID: Close t do you know where Clare de Lune coffee shop is , # PM: On university , # PM: it's actually like literally half a mile from my house . # PM: Small world as we were discussing before . # PM: Especially when we're all from the same general region . # PM: Right so okay , success on the whiteboard . # PM: You can harness the awesome power # PM: a little bit introductions we talked about some of our C_D_s and things we like about the city you know , I think we'll right so moving on to not fun stuff project finance . # PM: basically what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros . # PM: This is what the finance department has told me , the C_F_O_ but I don't know , I'm not sold on this , it's pretty dear , twenty f that's like you know forty bucks for a remote . # PM: It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me . # PM: we can maybe work on that a later but we're gonna make a lot on it , the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it . # PM: Eur internationally . # PM: one of the things I was gonna mention to you guys the designers is that it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably . # PM: something that could do N_T_S_C_ as well as PAL as well as various other formats like if it's gonna control D_V_D_s # PM: but you know I'll leave that to you guys but that's something that i it is gonna be an international sold thing . # PM: but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty . # PM: So we wanna try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can . # PM: s right so just to close up , I'm not sure how much time I've used mm next time right Project Manager , sorted . # PM: we'll meet in another half an hour or so and I'd like the Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it . # PM: U_I_D_ well you right g your assignments are up there and you'll also get s assignments from in your email as well more spec specifics on what do . # PM: mm basic and so I need you to tell us what we what the user's gonna want . # ME: What they're looking for . # PM: actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user's gonna want and what the user can have , you know like so # ME: And negotiate that . # PM: well it is and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between specific instructions will be sent in your email . # PM: But I think that is more or less a good place to start for now and as more things come up we'll have meetings and you'll get emails and so forth . # PM: any questions , before we get started ? # UI: I assume that we're building a stand alone remote control , we can't kind of build it into other products . # PM: You mean to like # UI: For instance like a mobile phone or something like that . # ID: Mm . Sounds interesting . # ME: I don't think there's any rules about it yet . So # ID: Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that . # UI: Or or you know can we produ can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ? # PM: have a think about it . # PM: I'm certainly op it seems it seems like it's certainly do-able isn't it . # PM: or if we can't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function . # PM: No I mean good idea , good idea . # PM: We'll see what see what # ID: Maybe a remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones . # ME: I like the little cover thingies . # PM: Uh-huh y I like that That's true , I guess we probably have some time , maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do , go back to I don't really have any . # PM: Let me bring up something about our basic goals here , what we want to accomplish . # PM: project announcement . Ts ts Not so much . # PM: All right we'll find them , we're on our own . # UI: are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here ? # PM: let's do it , let's do . # UI: does anybody have any initial ideas ? # PM: I'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too # ME: Good idea . Start your minutes . # PM: I mean oh right . So initial ideas . # ME: it's pretty much given it's gonna be universal we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things , as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do , like your microwave or your front door or like to have everything on one thing , but then , I've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons , # ID: S smaller's better . # ME: you can't tell what they do . # UI: But I'm thinking I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ design # UI: so touch screen design rather than button # ID: That'd be different . # UI: so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things . # ME: Interesting . # PM: that's slick isn't it . # PM: I mean like stylist a just a . Right so we got five minutes more to chat about this , perfect . # PM: we've got this kind of an idea of a trade-off between size and functionality . # ME: We want it to be munt multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart , # UI: Too confusing . # ID: It's gonna be too complicated , too crowded with buttons and things . # PM: I'm also gonna note for future reference this idea so you like maybe like an L_ like a touch screen type of remote ? # PM: I don't think one exists . # ME: An interesting option . # PM: Be a good idea . # ID: Needs it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes . # PM: all the other universal remotes . # PM: I don't know if there's such a thing out there , I guess we could do some do some research on or one of us could do some research on it about whether or not there are multi-format like you know PAL , N_T_S_C_ , region one # UI: I'm pretty sure there is . # UI: I have a friend who has a P_D_A_ that he just points at his telev any television he wants and it'll figure out the specifications of it and will control it # PM: Interesting . # UI: I assume that can be done with kind of around the world . # PM: I'm liking that idea , this idea of a touch screen remote with multi-format features . # ID: I think , making it out of a nice material would be very important , because so many of those remotes that you see , these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality . # ME: Keeping it nice and slick , would be important . # ME: I don't know , there's such a problem with losing them , that adding this whole like P_D_A_ pen business is only one more thing to lose , so we're gonna have to be careful with what like Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool . # UI: I like the idea of the multi plate . # ME: what are they called , those face plate things ? # PM: Think they're just called face plates ? # ME: Isn't there a name for them ? # ID: we'll have to come up with a name , patent it . # UI: We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well . # ME: Something really cool . # ME: Leopard print or something . # UI: For those cold winter days . # ID: Leopard print . # ID: I think , it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device , maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote . # PM: Mm . But if we're bundling it unless we're selling their telly with the remote . # UI: if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it . # UI: If you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either there used to be those whistling devices but that's a little bit annoying . # PM: Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page . # PM: Kinda like how on a lot of cordless regular phones , you have a page button and it goes , could we do something like that ? # UI: I think we could design into that . # PM: I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of you know Apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of you know # ME: And that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years , very much so . # PM: We do have the minimum am amount we were talking finances I dunno , selling a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote , twenty five Euro remote would be pretty you know it's pretty expensive so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price . # PM: Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote that's black and you know m massive , some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere . # PM: But have a think about what we can do , have a think about what we want to do , how we're gonna sell it # ME: Or if you our users in mind , these grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design , they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to , and who we're gonna be able to get it out of . # UI: We're talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros ? # PM: Twenty five Euros . # UI: Slight difference I guess . # PM: They're all weaker than they're all stronger than the Dollar . # PM: Although , computer parts , all if you're gonna upgrade your computer , buy it in the States . # PM: do you guys know Fry's ? Huge computer electronics store ? # PM: They serve right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about . # PM: Right so let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the project documents , so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure . # PM: And right so thanks for that . # PM: Let's just head back to work on what we were talking about bef goi h getting into . # ME: With half an hour ?
# PM: Right . So basically I'm just gonna go over real quickly some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this remote control . # PM: And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion . # PM: So basically what I've just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only . # PM: we're not doing D_V_D_ , we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be a television remote . # PM: it also needs to have the company colours included in it . # PM: that's red and black . # PM: And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics . # PM: and no teletext . # PM: I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do , so we don't wanna include that in this particular design . # PM: For reasons that I don't really know . # PM: There's but it's the board so there you go . # PM: So basically given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote . # PM: Anyway . So I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer to go ahead and make a presentation # ID: So do I unplug this bit here ? # ME: Gotta plug you in . # PM: Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it's gonna come up . # ID: That's page one of my presentation . # ME: For your first PowerPoint it's lovely . # ID: We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res successfully complete this project . # ID: remote control works as follows . # ID: This is all pretty basic stuff you guys . # ID: sends message to another system , there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . # ID: A user interface controls the chip , basically that's the casing and the buttons and accordingly the messages as well . # ID: my findings , I just did a preliminary study here and I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . # ID: And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . # ID: too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad . # ID: Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction . # ID: , components . Just some ideas that I had , energy source , it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . # ID: the user interface , since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic . # ID: The chip , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that , we can't really be different in that respect . # ID: , the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , multi channel , that's a word I made up , I don't really know what it means . # PM: 'Kay . Fair enough . # ID: PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and probably a two hundred foot range . # ID: and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices . # ID: but in this case it'll only be T_V_s . # ID: personal preferences , I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value , # PM: Is is there a way that we can use modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics # ID: 'cause we were thinking # PM: that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value if a white if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a pretty nice , # PM: you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with ? # ID: that shouldn't be a problem . # ID: for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do . # ID: That's the end of my presentation . # PM: Thank you very much Nathan . # PM: if next we can have the User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well . # PM: plug yourself in here . # PM: hit function F_ eight real quickly , hold down # ME: Looks like you're in okay . # ID: Is it plugged in well ? # ID: There it goes . # ID: Computer adjusting . # PM: There you go . Sweet . # UI: Here we have a my technical functions design presentation . # UI: so a few of the requirements we need here . # UI: we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal and possibly operate several different types of devices although we now find that that's no problem . # PM: sorry I couldn't get that g to use before . # UI: some of my findings . # UI: basically wanna send messages to a television set . # UI: that would be any number of different things such as switch on the television , switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , I think we're all quite intelligent and know what a normal remote control does . # UI: some of the other things I found is a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well # PM: Oh look at that . # UI: but this remote control has many functions so it can do a lot of things but it is quite complicated and most users will find it find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it . # UI: As you also notice it's quite a boring design . # UI: Another remote control , slightly different , it's a simpler remote control many less buttons but has many fewer functions , m much easier for the user to manipulate and use . # UI: it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring . # UI: my personal preferences . # UI: Revolutionise the idea of a remote control . # UI: so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display for the user to work with . # UI: And I was gonna add another slide here but I didn't quite have time there . # UI: Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like having multiple face but it's . # PM: Great . Thanks for that Ron . # ME: Does that mean I'm up ? # PM: yep that's you . # UI: I can plug you in . # ME: Oh that would be perfect . Thank you . # ME: Slide show up and running . # PM: Give it a little bit . # ME: there we go . Perfect . # ME: Okay . So this is me . # ME: basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices . # ME: pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , the majority of the time that's all that's going on , the other functions happen , for some people they're important , but the primary uses are really basic . # ME: and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use , they're not using a lot of it , they don't need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with . # ME: And we also found out that fifty percent of our people , their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . And then they can't find it in the room . # ME: So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people . # ME: there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes , and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . # ME: I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically , that's up to the design people , but it is s something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing , so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about . # ME: but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are the standards . # ME: So it's a good start for us . # PM: That's great . Thank you Sarah . # ME: Need to unplug this ? # PM: I'll just switch that back here . # PM: I'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase . # PM: Right so I think we've covered most of these important questions through this through you guys's presentations we've got y the Industrial Designer suggests or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic . # PM: Sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control , # PM: so do we wanna go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , and my thought is we've got w if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics . # ME: We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so . # PM: So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic . # PM: we need to wonder h about how we make it better and smaller and faster think we're constrained to plastics very well , we've got this idea , Ron was saying we need to think about revolutionising the way it's looking , which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for a telly . # PM: this voice operation thing is I think is a good idea assuming that it's doable , at least for the basic controls , maybe we can balance it that way , you know we can see . # PM: you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_ but we might be able to say volume up . # ID: I think it would be possible to combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology . # ME: That could work . I like that . # ID: With a simple command like locate . # ID: And then it could start to beep # ME: Something very basic . # ID: therefore be found . # ME: Is that only gonna be within our two hundred foot range then ? # ID: Oh I think that's very doable . # PM: The difficulty wh would be in I think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find . # PM: you have something that picks up a voice from far away # ID: It's a good point . # PM: If it's hidden under the couch but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button , maybe that could be voice activated too . # UI: A little sticky pad to stick on top of your television . # UI: And you just say something to into that finds your # PM: Or an isolated magnet or something like , or you know something that wouldn't interfere I don't know that'd be the technical thing but I like that , I like that , the voice recognition for the paging system . # UI: The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control . # UI: So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market . # UI: And the younger market could use kind of the voi voice control method and the older market might k # ME: Making it just an option ? # UI: exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not . # ID: I was thinking # ME: Are we still thinking about this screen # ME: if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we know if that's an option technically right now to that ? # UI: 'S definitely an option technically . # UI: I've looked into costs of touch screen methods and what not , they seem to be you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point . # ME: We're doing okay . # ME: 'Cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions , you can have menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things that you're not gonna use every day and that a lot of people aren't gonna use but it is an option there for this hi-tech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we're going for . # ID: Gotta wonder though , if we're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things . # ME: Worth looking into . # ID: It seems like , we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip . # ID: The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the whole mechanism . # ID: So it's just something to consider . # PM: Mm 'kay well I guess we'll cross that bridge in a la slightly later stages of development but I know , that's perfectly viable question . # PM: Mm 'kay so I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned remote control . # PM: I think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it I don't think there's too many , we'd more or less be cornering the market on it as well , we don't have many . # PM: I appear to have lost my microphone . Mm . # PM: we don't have many people or there's not very many competitors out there that do that so cool . # PM: I guess we've c we've touched on most of this . The idea of a paging function , a touch screen , and face plates . # PM: The thing with I see would there not be a we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ? # UI: I'm not sure that's sincerely correct , I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable . # ME: Mm . Just the casing . # UI: We could have the casing , the face plates . # ID: Back to the cost the material . # ID: We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package ? # ID: That's something I w for say we're including three or four face plates , it's gonna drive the cost up . # ID: And the other question is , if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate that market ? # ID: We haven't done any tests on face plates and whether See if there if there's even interest out there . # ID: Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere . # PM: 'cause then ha you would have to who all # PM: it's not like with cell phones like where you have a you know Nokia model X_ and then ten people make face plates for it , we'd be just our model of pho of t remote control . # ME: in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around , it is sort of emblematic whereas you're just sit at home , so unless somebody comes over to watch T_V_ # UI: hopefully some people have people coming t over to w to hang out at your house # ME: True . True . True . # UI: and most people have their televisions in the living room . # PM: Alright well we can we can discuss that one further when we think about whether th when we do costs and so forth , . # PM: True , if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway we'll cross that bridge later but we will have to evaluate what's most important . # PM: I think we've had a bit of discussion already on this thing , s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations ? # UI: have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a touch screen Interface ? # PM: I think that would be best . # PM: based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or b plastic cased 'cause tha that's easy on the cost , try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and I think that's a great idea . # PM: With a touch screen for the basic functions . # PM: And we'll let's provisionally let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen . # PM: do we have Mm wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls . # PM: Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost . # ME: 'Cause it would have a docking base ? # PM: But then again that costs as well . # UI: these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen ? # UI: Those new ones . # ID: Can we afford to include one of those ? # ME: Can we afford that ? # ME: And will somebody buy it if we don't ? # PM: I don't think I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology . # PM: Okay so let's go with a touch screen with some kind of you know with some kind of cutting edge battery technology # ME: For twelve Euros ? # PM: well hey you know well it's worth looking into , if not we can always default to just doing a well presented plastic simple # PM: you know so you know . Well I mean # PM: you can put the we could I dunno I mean I suppose we could put the basics on the centre easiest you know , you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu w we'll do the aesthetics . # PM: Okay so we'll touch screen and the battery , focus on presentation . # PM: it's th with this voice recognition option as well just as for the simple functions the on off , channels , volume , and a small paging function . # PM: Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while to emit some kind of paging . Just a beep . # PM: right so any comments ? Thoughts before we break into go into the next round of individual work on this . # ID: Since we're doing touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ? # ID: Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody . # UI: Be interesting . # ID: What what would be on that touch screen ? # ID: 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and logo or something or motto , I can't remember exactly what you said . # UI: We put fashion into electronics . # PM: it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control . # ME: then you're dealing with ports and cords and # PM: I think perhaps # PM: good idea I think that one m might just be and they just I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular # PM: a P_D_A_ would they would makes a lot of sense for a P_D_A_ 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway I dunno , what do you guys think ? # ID: Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen . # ID: That'd be okay . # UI: I I'm in agreement with that , I'm wondering how we're gonna get we put fashion into electronics onto this device . # ME: but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading and then it goes away , perhaps it could be like a temporary Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think . # UI: I'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on . # PM: it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there . # ME: you would think . # PM: But apparently not . # ID: People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on . # ME: If it comes from above . # ID: They just want it to be on and ready to go . # PM: that would help the battery life too and if it the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on . # PM: But then again who wants to turn on a remote control . # UI: all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on . # PM: to wake up or go into like a dormant mode . # UI: Goes into a sleep mode . # PM: Oh I like that I like the idea of putting the logo in the boot up screen , nice . # PM: any last things before we break ? # PM: Alright . Fair enough . # PM: I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders . # PM: I'm gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference . # UI: I've put my files in the shared folder as well . # PM: That's fab guys . Cool .
# ME: That went well , thank you . # PM: Alright , let me just PowerPoint this up . # PM: Right so this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . # PM: , think of it 's kind of turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . # PM: In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . # PM: Right so , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . # PM: , fair enough , thanks for the input , 's always good . # PM: basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , and gonna go through you , whoever wants to go first is f fine by me and we'll collate what we know about what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . # PM: And then we'll make some more decisions on basic firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . # PM: without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to . # PM: Alright Nathan , # PM: It is Nathan right ? # PM: I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ? # ID: Nathan's fine . # ID: It's either Nathan or participant two . # UI: Mister participant two that is . # ID: basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers , Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that . # ID: , components of a remote control , okay . We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . # ID: Energy source , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . # ID: Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . # ID: , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . # ID: Basically , it's like a the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . # ID: So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen . # ID: So we'll have to look into that . # ID: , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . # ID: and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved . # PM: What kind of th thickness are we looking at ? # ID: , I imagine that we could specify . # ID: , I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . # ID: , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , and that would cost us more . # ID: And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that . # ID: and just a little note there , touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro . # ID: , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . # ID: So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . # ID: And if you were to record if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . # ID: one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick . # ID: So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it . # ME: Interesting . # ID: Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that . # PM: is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like # ID: I am sure that we could do that . # PM: I like the idea , it's a good idea . # ID: just as a fun gimmick . # ID: Just to set us apart a little bit . # ID: , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip . # ID: , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one eight three five . # ID: findings , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ? # UI: Interesting question . # ID: 'S a bit of a challenge question . # ME: I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ? # ID: Right , that's my concern too . # ID: , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . # ID: My personal preference is I'll just throw my cards on the table , I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . # ID: , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and I was thinking about I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . # ID: So we're not so confined by one style and say some you know , say our the one if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation . # PM: Can we do marketing piloting too ? # PM: Try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they're received ? # ME: It's an option , but actually there's I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now # ME: which actually might even come into play beforehand , # ME: it may help us decide for now . Temporarily anyway . # PM: thank you very much Nathan . # ID: Oh , you're welcome . # PM: That's perfect , so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here . # ME: I guess so , 'cause I found some interesting things . # ME: You waiting for me ? # PM: Fascinating , compelling even . # ME: what a teaser ain't it . # ME: current market trends . # ME: , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what's trendy , what's new , what's happening . # ME: , remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting they're sick of this boring , normal , functional , that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . # ME: the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing . # ME: Now I'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean , v line thing may be something we can look into . # ME: Different skin options , or if we can't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface , maybe having the b images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be # ME: a different shape or okay , not the example I would choose , but you know what I mean to t sort of and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy , # UI: I like it , I like it . # ME: not something I I've come up with a though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like , leather options or wood options or something # ID: I should have mentioned this . # ID: As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case , it has a consistency of those stress balls . # ME: Might be an interesting way to go . # ME: something to sit on for now . # ME: overall I think we should stick with what we're finding , everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now . # PM: Interface , oh the interface graphics for the # ME: but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue . # ID: I like the idea of rubber too because it's tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it doesn't matter . # ID: 'Cause so many you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls . # ME: Very true . Very true . # ID: Taped with duck tape and what have you , # ID: you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber . # PM: it's ubiquitous isn't it ? # UI: We can have a duck tape casing . # ME: I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line , # UI: It could go with the granola crowd . # ME: but worth a shot . # ME: it could be , it could be , that's what I know . # PM: thanks for that Sarah . # UI: Computer's adjusting . # UI: One moment please . # UI: interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer . # UI: So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise perceive . # UI: , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system . # UI: Here's a d series of different remote controls that are out on the market today . # UI: I think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look . # UI: the following are a bunch of different interface concepts . # UI: voice recognition , we actually have some new information from our research design team but I'll get to that in a moment . # UI: current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . # UI: our design team , research team , has been able to set up a system in which you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to with standard responses . # UI: Like you could say good morning remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . # UI: In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line # PM: Lot of single people on the on the re on the remote control research team # UI: On the remote control # ME: Very true , very true . # UI: , another concept is what Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with L_C_ display like on the iPod which I am sure most of you know about . # UI: and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern a bit bulky , a bit crazy , I don't think that's we're necessarily going for . # UI: And some special components , ideas like blocking , having the ability to block channels from your for your children and dedicated buttons for commonly used channels and even ideas like secured or hidden programming but I again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue . # UI: and this is kind of the big daddy of remote controls here . # UI: the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose . # UI: , again probably not what we're going for so I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod with a hard cla c plastic casing although I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely very good ideas . # UI: changeable casings our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it # UI: and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our bottom line . # UI: touch screen interface , possibly having go-to buttons being stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . # UI: , and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already and the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features that are around red for power , arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not . # UI: And perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank has jokes when it's ready . # UI: And that is about it . # PM: Great , wonderful Ron , cool . # PM: Lot of good ideas , good facts to have . # PM: That's what they need , it's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom . # PM: Right so , good to know all that stuff , thanks guys , . # PM: Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . # PM: Based on what Nathan presented as far as the various costs and benefits I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ? # ME: I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places . # ME: But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then # ID: My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote , # PM: To produce each one . # ID: that's just an estimate though . # UI: Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects . # UI: You industrial designers . # ME: And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ? # ME: Do we remember ? # ID: I thought there was some flexibility with that . # PM: There is , it's just , it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money . # ME: Can we justify it ? # PM: , from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift hundred per cent profit margin that would mean selling it from twenty five . # PM: If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five . # UI: Where do you guys come up with these numbers ? # ID: That's just off the top of my head , # PM: From the board , # ID: it is pending further emails . # ME: Though I think that's what people would pay for , I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something # ID: It is the new it would be in a class of its own . # PM: And that's to be fair the per cent of the market we're not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway , we're gonna make I mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just couldn't , not for twenty-five Euros , we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that's something that we can have finance deal with . # PM: , I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ? # UI: I'm thinking that's definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper means to go about this kind of production , my team in the on the third floor suggested that # ME: See if we can cut some corners . # ME: Right . Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper . # ID: We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on # ME: It's a starting point anyway , # PM: we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , there's always the opportunity , if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever , you know , w we , I guess we can play around with it a bit . # PM: Alright , let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our main selling point here . # UI: I mean I think that we really have two main selling points , I think that our casing and the voice recognition # ME: 'cause with voice recognition I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote . # PM: The voice rec thing , I mean , if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , I think we might have to drop the voice rec . # ME: I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely . # UI: To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house , # UI: I mean we've come up with this , with this new voice we're using it for our coffee machines already . # ME: We've already got it . # UI: I can pass you on that email from my guy in guy down the hall . # PM: What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ? # ID: I think if we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up but it does put it into it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . # ID: It would be very nice . # UI: I mean we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say . # ME: and they said they wanted voice recognition . # ME: Course , maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell is a call I don't think I can give the highs ups . # ME: Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know . # UI: Does having both really up our costs ? # PM: I can't see how it wouldn't , I mean , there's you know the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , pick two of three . # PM: You know , you can't you can't have all three . # ID: 'cause you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function . # PM: It's just impossible . # PM: if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two . # PM: Otherwise , we just it just becomes cost prohibitive . # PM: which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ? # ME: we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . # ME: But I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model . # ID: I would have to side with that , I think the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the all the technology in-house , it's ready to go , it's packaged , # PM: What does the cost look like Ron ? # PM: Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the touch screen ? # ID: , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but I think the voice recognition would they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up , but , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition we're not gonna have to do as much design work and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up , if you know what I mean . # UI: , I definitely have to agree with that last comment . # ME: And we're still not then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either , we can stick with what we've already got . # ME: In a lot other ways too . # PM: Okay . So I'm getting alright so more or less you guys think that o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . # ME: I think it's our lower risk option which for right now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option . # PM: We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition . # UI: It's you and me outside a little here . # ME: and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's you guys's next step right ? # PM: we'll sic we'll sort out what it what f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype but that's our next step , it'll be a developing of prototype . # ID: Are we going to talk now about the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things ? # PM: We'll just run through it , . # PM: You discussed either a lithium or a solar power . # PM: Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? # PM: Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ? # ID: , the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install a small backup battery . # ID: Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to # ME: what of people with like the T_V_ in their basement , like what if wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably # ID: it works about the same as a solar powered calculator , and you know how those don't really require that much light , # ID: , but obviously a little more light than a calculator , but we're not talking about a lot of light . # ID: Doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything . # PM: What do you think Ron ? # UI: I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said . # UI: I have to say though that another idea's come up in my head . # UI: If we're really not handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little neat thing that sits on your table or something . # ME: Interesting . # ID: Why , why moving away from hand-held , why ? # UI: Just a thought . # ID: What's the idea ? # UI: if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point . # ME: if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job . # ID: Do you think people that are people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes . # ME: and i probabl I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too , # PM: we have to have buttons on it too as well . # PM: But that's done , that's no bother I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have or like who is it , Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass and you know and then they got these little pyramidal type of speakers . # PM: I mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing , it could still have the basic buttons on it . # PM: , 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well . # PM: And maybe a menu button and so forth , you know use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know I mean we can sort that out . # ID: I think , I think you're on to something because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote . # ID: Maybe something that looks nice on a table is would be good , even though and hand-held the same time . # UI: I think it's all about following Apple's lead on a lot of these things . # ME: I'm thinking of the airport portal , you know like that little pod looking thing ? # ID: those are nice . # PM: I mean a nice although we do wh is I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing and get back to it but you could have a very tasteful wood coloured or earth tone kind of # ME: That would be kinda neat . # ME: Terracotta bowl or something . # PM: Still , I mean , along those lines . # PM: I like that , I like that idea a lot . # PM: , let's see what we can do as far as that goes . # PM: And the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being using like a rubber kind of softer feel , you know if you feel the tip on this pen it's a bit gives just a bit . # PM: You know something where it's a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it . # ID: Just kind of the squishy feel . # ME: which is the next big thing , so that's not gonna hurt us either . # PM: let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control . # PM: But to be fair , I mean , you just c you could just put it literally put it on the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up . # PM: I like it , I like the idea , that's good . # PM: and we've sorted of discussed costs , . I guess we'll a that's gonna be a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay , . # ID: Sorry about the lack of information on cost , I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers # PM: We'll have more of an idea when the prototype have more of a # ID: and I'm just having to guess . # PM: we'll have more of an idea later on . # PM: And we just go from there . # PM: we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out , I think so we're more or less con we wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex . # ME: Right . Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis , although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those shouldn't be # PM: Like maybe have menu things . # ME: Take precedence , # ID: If , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can just incorporate maybe something that folds out like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things . # ME: And they slide . # ME: and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options , # UI: Think then we're hitting our cost issue again . # PM: we've also got the me the thing of , # ME: we're still not making it easier then . # PM: if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote , how do we . # PM: B But no I mean # PM: we could do a slide or a compartment , you know , like if it say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there . # PM: Or you know , a b a b a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on like on a D_V_D_ player . # PM: You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them # ME: it's just a scroll . # PM: and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that . # ID: are we gonna are we talking we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ? # PM: it seems like I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of rubber for the outside case # PM: we might as well stick with that . # UI: I think to a certain extent we have to stick with kind of a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command . # ME: Well no it's basic just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for . # PM: We've already kind of covered this as well . # PM: That seems to be selling and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market , . # PM: Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . # ME: particularly in technological fields , so that's exactly where we're headed . # PM: alright , well , more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype . # UI: Well what are we actually doing ? # PM: I was just gonna step on to # ME: it wasn't in the way but , whatever . # ME: No , don't worry about it . # PM: I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth any other final thoughts before we go ahead and # ID: have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ? # ID: Or are we just going to go with one ? # ID: ..It's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well mm . # ID: It's a tough situation , but obviously having more cases also costs more # PM: then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have a , you know , a kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and , I don't know , olive green or something . # ID: There's an idea . # PM: That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing . # UI: And again copying iMac's kind of for iPod Mac Apple's colour scheme . # PM: , I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on multiple case colours . # PM: stick with the same kind of kinda , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . # PM: Alright , so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , . # PM: I want the I'd like Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of non-remote remote . # PM: , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . # PM: And Ron if you can figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . # PM: Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . # PM: , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . # PM: I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , using prototype building materials . # PM: And also specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well . # ID: Oh excellent . # PM: So that's what to start with for now , is that alright , you guys feel clear about this ? # ID: That sounds good . # PM: I guess we'll just hit the bricks .
# ME: I totally 'cause I moved it . # ME: 'S put it over here . # ME: Then we don't have to worry about it . # UI: Ready for this ? # PM: Alright , it is PowerPoint time . # PM: I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment which is kind of fun . # PM: here we have our detailed design meeting where we will look at the prototype right so , I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me . # PM: It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting . # PM: Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary and I'm therefore I'm taking the minutes , s so just to go just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , I will open them slowly , no ? # PM: Wait for it , wait for it . # ME: that's not you . # PM: That's how the This is , this is very high-powered stuff here , double-clicking , there we go . # PM: basically the moral of the story from our last minute last meeting was that we that we had meetings from we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here and what sort of limitations we're operating with excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . # PM: That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . # PM: , and the uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . # PM: That's sorted , back to the main meet here , go ahead and take it away guys . # ID: we have assembled our prototype , . # ID: What's to be said about it ? # ID: , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , . # ID: Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , . # ID: This is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels and then two volume buttons down here , d we decided those were the most important buttons . # ID: And then , for the more advanced functions there is a slide out panel here and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . # ID: But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , . # ID: As far as the whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , why not ? # ID: Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . # UI: it's important to we talked a quite a bit about you know the interchangeable faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here f we call it fruity if you will . # ME: Appropriate , okay . # UI: of course that's interchangeable and I think it would be desirable for the for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued but this is kind of something that can be done # ME: It is an option . # UI: and as you can see on the television there we have the voice detector device on the top there . # ID: That's this here . # UI: So that will work quite well with regard to finding this contraption . # UI: , what other things do we see here , well , if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel , I think that will work well with regards to our market . # UI: let's see , clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available . # UI: do you have anything else to add to that ? # ID: I worried about the materials , the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped . # ID: , and of course as you can see and if you touch it does have that nice squishy feel . # UI: It's actually important to note that the television , you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside . # ID: I dunno if you noticed , but I wrote the company's name on the telephone screen , # PM: well done , oh ok # ID: I thought that was kinda nice . # ID: This was actually an apple on the inside . # ME: Do we need to worry about rot factors ? # UI: it's encased in a new type of # ME: Oh okay , there's preservatives involved , # ME: we don't need to worry , # ID: We got a bit ahead of ourselves , # ID: I know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but # PM: Edible televisions , it's a wave of the future . # UI: It's pos a possible new product . # ME: It's a couple years off at least . # UI: but I think that's I think that sums up the main features of our of the remote , # UI: I dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that whether we need to worry about any other marketing areas or anything of that nature . # UI: , did we come in under budget ? # ID: This cost to put this into production , we're looking at about what was our goal ? # ID: It was twelve fifty Euro and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine . # ID: , so I was quite pleased with that . # ID: One thing that we didn't do obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button and since we did that we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep the cost down . # ID: So even though it has a lot of modern technology , for example the voice recognition , in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote and I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers we might be able to get even cheaper . # UI: Did we talk about the voice recognition option ? # ID: Oh no , we haven't talked about that yet have we ? # UI: on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh console and I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look . # UI: , but basically the voice recognition incorporates the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw come up with . # UI: Basically quite similar to the coffee maker design that we were talking about earlier and , I think that has given a proven ease of use and what not . # UI: And allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user , so . # ID: Any questions ? # ME: Do we have other , for lack of a better word , skins ? Covers ? # PM: I think that's # ME: In play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ? # ID: , do you wanna answer this one # ME: Do we know where we stand on that yet ? # ID: or do you want me to answer it ? # UI: we didn't quite have enough material . # ME: I wasn't expecting a prototype # ME: I just didn't know if you guys had any in mind yet . # ID: as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like # ME: Just veneer really , # UI: Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips and then you put a new a new a new plate on top of that . # ME: And the whole thing # UI: I mean there are I we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non-natural look materials # UI: which I think worked out fine . # UI: We also continued on with the ideas that f following Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the light orange and the green . # ME: Okay , very cool . # ID: It's not it's not quite a face plate , it's more like a pseudo-face plate because it's simple enough that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it , it locks into place such that , you know , it's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way if you know what I mean . # ME: It's still an option if we need it . # ME: Very cool , nice job . # PM: thanks guys that's very , very good work . # PM: I like it , brilliant . # PM: , what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , I got me you've got you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice . # PM: the trouble is I was just given this by finance . # PM: , it's a spreadsheet of the parts and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like . # PM: I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly , but it looks like we'll just if we can just itemize what's in here , we've got this it's a solar cell thing With a back-up battery ? # ID: we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there , # PM: With the ba okay . # UI: The voice recognition area actually doubles as the solar cell area . # PM: Clever , clever , well done . # PM: so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it ? # ID: It's just making use of the same space and the same materials , # PM: and the case , it's more of a single-curved case , I guess would be that be the general # ID: one big curve I guess you could say . # PM: and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout . # PM: . Push button interface with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we ? # PM: And a special I guess it's we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that throughout , # ID: And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , don't you ? # ID: 'Cause it i it is very unconventional , # PM: it's quite unique . # ID: I like to think of it as unconventional . # PM: I like it , it looks like # ME: M come in at sixteen ? # PM: a bit over budget , . # ID: doesn't match up does it ? # PM: what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells or take out the back-up battery . # ID: How do you feel about that ? # UI: I think that if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that . # ID: I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working what am I gonna do ? # ID: People'd be real upset . # ID: I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery , it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have . # PM: What's difficult , we have all these things integral to the to the design of it that we just can't back out of now , it would have to be seems like we'd have to go back to square one in a way . # PM: if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it , # ME: Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if I've done my math correctly . # UI: I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing I mean that's what sets us apart # ME: Which , it's that's what setting us into this young market , I mean that's where we started from , so I don't know , and I mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league . # UI: And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I'd like to stick with the solar cell , but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here and you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here # PM: It's either or . # UI: and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell . # ID: I guess we might have to do that . # ME: I think unfortunately that's our best option . # ID: It's the only way we're gonna get below our goal isn't it ? # ID: Of twelve fifty . # PM: 'Cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're # PM: and we can't get rid of the I mean removing the # PM: changing the case wouldn't be so much of a , nor would changing the case materials . # PM: that looks like to be the only thing . # PM: So that would be the it's a major change but Alright , so # ID: Gotta do what you gotta do . # PM: we're in agreement on that . # ME: Unfortunately I think we are . # UI: I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah . # PM: Moving along swiftly . # PM: I guess now we just go to the project evaluation which I will allow Sarah to take over . # ME: That would be me . # ME: Can you reach , that would be great , thank you . # PM: That'd be great # ME: I didn't even do that one on purpose either , basically I was just evaluating from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they're important . # ME: so I was looking at basic design things , does it fulfil its functions as a remote ? # ME: Is the design what we wanted it to do ? # ME: are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? . # ME: Basic questions like , you know , does it turn on ? # ME: Does it respond to voice recognition ? # ME: And overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par . # ME: , the only thing is with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface , that looked like it was coming up rough , but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense . # ME: So I think overall we're headed in the right direction . # UI: They like that spongy feel . # ME: It looks like it's going over well , so # UI: And the paging function works well , that's good to hear , # UI: we worked hard on that one . # ME: I think eventually if we do branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff , but for now , what we've got is working in the range we need it for , it's all good . # ID: I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel # ME: That's everything from me . # ME: it is a set-back , do you need the cord back ? # UI: W we might have we might have lost that granola market again # PM: they don't own tellys anyway do they ? # UI: I guess that's true . # PM: Right . So , this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , . # PM: I got this slide from the coach and I'm not sure what it's connected to . # PM: so I guess we are going to discuss our project process and that is gonna go into my report . # PM: I guess this is the point where we go out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , I guess , . # ME: As in within the team or ? # ID: Right so it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or # PM: I think it's I , I think so . # PM: I think hope I'm not screwing up an experiment . # ME: It is now , you're in charge there you go . # PM: But I trust that she would jump in if I was so okay fair enough . # PM: right , so any thoughts ? # ID: Are we considering these points here ? # ME: I think they're starting blocks # PM: What do you guys feel about the process ? # ME: , you know I think in general , for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive , considering the little amount of input we had going in . # ME: , and the technology has definitely been a help , it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff . # UI: We didn't use the whiteboard at all . # PM: No , no whiteboard . # ME: We could now if that'd make up for it but really and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter . # UI: , also had I not been intrigued about the pen , I don't think I woulda used it at all , I didn't write barely anything . # ME: I think I was taking notes more often than usual # ME: just 'cause I liked the pen , . # PM: Was pretty cool tack though . # ME: I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach . # ID: As you write your personal coach . # ME: but I didn't get a response # ID: What if you get a response two or three months from now ? # ID: That'd be weird . # ME: that would be kinda creepy . # PM: Attempts to contact coach ineffective . # ME: what kind of coaching is that really ? # ME: What if I really needed something . # UI: n I think there was a lot of room for creativity , we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , . # ME: And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be . # UI: With the natural look . # PM: Very natural look . # ID: That's very natural . # ME: Organic , really . # PM: That's the brilliance of they had a p they had a peeler in here . # ME: And highly resourceful team mates might I add which is always a plus . # PM: I think , re I thought it was like really creative actually , I mean . # UI: I think the teamwork was good as well . # ME: I'm impressed . # ID: And to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of Play-Doh , we used every bit . # ME: All four of those little containers . # PM: Including the s the multi-coloured wave pattern . # ID: I guess My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with , we only had four , wasn't enough . # ME: You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours . # ID: it could have been amazing . # PM: What did you guys think about the roles ? # ME: They were good . # ID: it's f kind of fun , I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough . # ID: At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up , # ID: which was kind of fun . # ME: Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . # ME: I mean maybe it's just me but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all . # PM: That's true , I got this spreadsheet . # ME: Nothing , I didn't even get an email , that was it . # ME: I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped . # UI: I think that was I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to # UI: but also when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing # ME: that wasn't very much . # UI: and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was because that was kind of the interface portion which was what the whole project was about # UI: and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , # ID: I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the PowerPoint slides already put together for you # UI: which was fine . # ID: 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time . # ME: , already having the formatted stuff helped a lot . # UI: And I think your leadership was quite good . # ID: It was really good . # PM: She said I she actually made a comment off boy you're getting into this and I really I think it's true I did get I felt like I got way too into it . # ME: That's kind of a good thing though , # PM: I felt like I slipped into it a lot . # ID: It's kinda fun . # ME: you know , give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey . # UI: is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role ? # PM: The first time I've ever done anything like project management . # PM: I usually organise crap , it's one thing to do , you know set up a party with your friends , you know ? # ID: Little different . # PM: But you guys felt that you could keep the , suspension of disbelief kind of like the role and the okay ? # ME: except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand and I knew we were all lying through our teeth , # UI: I had to admit , as soon as w we started I mean as soon as we got the Play-Doh , th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window . # ME: other than that I could only imagine . # PM: Maybe in Legos you know ? Be fun with Legos too , # PM: like make a remote control or spaceship , we used to have spaceship Legos did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos # PM: everybody knows best spaceships ever . # UI: still have 'em . # PM: you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ? # PM: No I , no I dunno , I d I dunno , # PM: don't I was just I # ME: Though we didn't actually I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building , # ME: but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings . # UI: I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team . # PM: Course I'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team you know it's like , kind of like , like . # ME: that is kind of # PM: Interesting . It's kind of fascinating wasn't it ? # PM: I mean the whole process of # ID: Wonder why is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the board ? # PM: I don't know if there was a ri I th # ME: Mine was the mics . # ME: I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires , # ME: I was afraid I was gonna break something actually . # ID: 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or . # UI: I dunno what I woulda shown on that board . # ME: but it didn't even occur to me as an option , I mean I don't know that I would have but I know that I consciously didn't . # UI: it's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for . # UI: , because I've got this laptop . Standard , I just used it 'cause it's literally right in front of me . # PM: I wanna see the output files from these , from the digital paper . # ME: it looks really professional . # PM: I wanna see wh what my handwriting looks like digitized because my handwriting is crap . # PM: just to see what it looks like in P_D_F_ format or something . # ID: Usually I would do a lot more doodling too but I didn't because # ME: I felt like I needed to be professional so I didn't like draw all over my paper and stuff . # ME: Okay , well not entirely , but still , I doodled less than I usually do . # PM: I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like . # PM: You know , like what is the what exactly we're looking for here . # UI: is this all we need to get through ? # PM: I dunno , I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about . # ME: It did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ? # PM: that's the thing I got i in the email I got this PowerPoint file but this slide was just there , # ME: That slide was like that ? # PM: I didn't change this one at all . # ID: I guess we're on the right track . # UI: Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ? # PM: W I kinda like th # ME: I think they still do their job . # ID: I think they're fine actually . # ME: I am thinking outside the little square box though , with literally in like form # ID: maybe a s a circle would be alright , different . # PM: Does kinda make you wonder , how much can you do with a remote control ? # PM: It's like inventing a new car . # ME: It's still gotta be technically car shaped or it won't fit on the road , you know ? # UI: What is that ? Our limited ability to think outside the box ? # PM: So this was other costs . # ID: Are we back into project mood ? # PM: I think this is # ME: how long was our meeting supposed to be ? # ME: How much time do we have left ? # PM: I mm we should go on a bit about the project eval , . # PM: I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit under-stimulated on the whole thing . # PM: what like you know what am I really doing , you know what is # ME: at the beginning it started out and I felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work and I was like had like all this brainstorming I was doing and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't really care about anyway so type away . # UI: I think it was the real . # ME: You know , you know what I mean like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore . # ID: Definitely when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to how much I stressed over it and then by the time I got to the last one I was like , you know , not very much . # UI: Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation # UI: which wasn't so clear to me at the beginning . # PM: I actually didn't do that at all though , every single one I a all the presentations I either added slides or edited 'em . # UI: I added like five slides too , # ID: Did you really ? # ME: I only got blank ones . # ID: I just got blank ones # ME: My slides were all blank , they'd have a title maybe # ME: and they were just empty . # PM: Did they not have they didn't like mine they didn't come like this ? # PM: Like with this was what it looks like . # PM: This is what that looked like , # ME: Like with those words already on it ? # PM: literally , just like that . # PM: Interesting . # ME: I wondered why yours always looked so more complicated . # ID: I deleted slides . # ME: I think I added a slide one time . # UI: I added many slides every time # ME: with the whole new background being innovative , that was class . # ID: That was pretty cool , it was a high moment of the whole experiment . # PM: Interesting . # PM: Any other thoughts come to mind ? # ME: I wanna know how our product would fare . # ID: I think it would fail , I think # ME: I can't just leave it there . # ID: it'd be a huge disaster , especially if it looks like that . # ME: I think it would take extensive marketing , an apple with a red button on top , even I am sceptical . # ME: But you know the whole # ID: we kind of designed it to look little bit like a face . # ID: It's a happy face . # UI: Actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to fr some other design modifications . # UI: I hope you appreciate the incorporation of some tin foil from a random Kit-Kat bar # ME: I noticed that . By accident . # UI: that happened to be consumed . # PM: Interesting . # ME: An interesting day all in all I would say . # UI: again I reiterate my question of how different we are comp compared to the other groups , especially between culture groups and what not . # PM: It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically . You know from the basics to the conce # PM: although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , I don't think I really understood like the concept . # PM: the notion of # ME: 'Cause it's such a functional item . # PM: i it's not like I have a concept of a mug's material , it's just it is what it is . # PM: You know , maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of we sh I thought of I thought of rather than in terms of concepts I thought of it in terms of proposed idea . # PM: And then the final would be like th the actual specified prototype or whatever , I dunno . # PM: All in all it's kinda interesting . # ID: we have more slides or ? # PM: just this closing one . # PM: we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , but we could s you know do it # ME: We got it to be . # PM: We did the project evaluation based on Sarah's evaluation of on off switches # ME: Like cutting corners . # ME: Kind of , though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general . # ME: Which I'm not sure is the same thing , at the time that just i made more sense , but I could see if they were really asking about us . # PM: 'Cause we di we had a thu think about it . # PM: And it's all recorded , woo-hoo . # PM: what I'm gonna I'm gonna put I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports . # ID: It'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording . # ME: Make it sound eloquent . # ME: I have to done I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that mean nothing . # PM: There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics . # UI: What the uhs and the # ME: There's a guy studying it here , he's studying ums and ahs or something . # ID: Filler words or ? # PM: they're called disfluencies . # ID: Disfluencies . # ME: That's a good word for it . # PM: we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things . # ME: Just add some prefixes , sounds classier . # PM: Exactly I will save this into the project documents . # ID: I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom , # ID: like c come on gimme something . # ME: pretty compulsively during meetings , like , . # PM: Come on give me some information . # PM: to be fair we're hooked we're all hooked on the internet , so I mean I do the # ME: we are addicts . # UI: just around that eight or nine people that are # PM: imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . # PM: It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ? # PM: I mean , you know , it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight modems to broadband all the time . # UI: Dude , I think we've had internet for like eighteen years . # PM: we have but I not in the sense that it's so un you know ubiquitous # ME: But it's not regular I mean my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four , but still . # UI: In the eighties ? # ME: My grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had an E_D_U_ and gov network . # ME: There's basically the fundamental structures , but it wasn't household to household yet because it hadn't been # UI: it was to the like seven universities or something . # ME: partitioned off and stuff , that was him . # UI: You guys ready to celebrate ? # PM: that's our last step . Celebration . # ME: Apparently , does that include like champagne or something exciting ? # PM: I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part . # ME: I think that's a closer . # ID: Has it been forty minutes or whatever ? # ID: this has been long enough . # PM: Where do you find that ? # ME: I have no idea . # ID: Is that the only song you have ? # UI: There is another one . # PM: Is this one of those media player ? # ID: That's awesome . # PM: The default track . # PM: I thought it was David Burns , look into the eyeball . # ID: Maybe I have a different one . # PM: That's one that seems to be shipping with it shipped with for a while , maybe this is the new version . # ME: is that a close ? # PM: I guess we'll call that a doner . # ME: that's the end of the meeting . # ME: Thank you gentlemen . # ME: I feel like I'm signing off .
# PM: Hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting for our new product that we're gonna be designing . # PM: I'm Mandy and I'm the Project Manager . # PM: And I know all your names again , Courtney , Fenella and Amber . # PM: Alright . Okay , so first let's go through this PowerPoint . # PM: I wonder what button I press ? # UI: Just do it on the arrow . # PM: or how about I just click ? # PM: Okay , here is our agenda for this meeting . # PM: we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions . # PM: We're gonna get to know each other a little bit better . # PM: tool training , we're going to , I guess , figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles . # PM: we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting . # PM: Okay , here is our project . # PM: We're gonna make a new remote control that's original , trendy and also user-friendly . # PM: And how we are going to do it is each of us is going to We're gonna have discuss the functional design first , how is it gonna be used , what's the actual goal here , it has to operate T_V_ , blah . # PM: And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet . # PM: Same thing with conceptual design . # PM: Just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work , meet . # PM: That's pretty much the whole process for today . # PM: And then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote . # PM: Okay . Alright . # PM: First we're gonna start off by using our tools . # PM: And the whiteboard thing , do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here . # ID: I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing . # ME: We could , we could on here . # PM: Alright , let's go forward then . # PM: right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal . # PM: Even if you are not a good drawer like me . # ID: Artistic skills , nil . # ID: I draw like I'm in grade five . # PM: 'Kay , about one more minute . # PM: And who would like to start us off ? # ME: this is my picture . # ME: I drew fish I like fish , because , you know , their whole water-vascular system thing . # ME: It's pretty cool , and they've got a pretty good habitat and they are pretty sometimes , sometimes vicious but that's okay . # PM: Only if they're piranhas . # ME: they they're easy , you know . # PM: Who wants to go next ? # ID: I drew a kitty . # ID: It's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat , but I love cats . # PM: No , it looks like a cat . # UI: No , I kne I knew . # ME: , it does look like a cat . # ID: I love cats because they're independent , they pretty much know what they want , they get it , they move on . # PM: I love cats , too . # PM: I'm a cat person . # ME: I'm allergic to cats . # ID: I'm allergic to cats , too . # PM: If you're around one # UI: In my next life . # PM: I had a roommate who was allergic , but if she was around my cat forever she became used to it , you know , # ME: , if you're around them for a long period of time # ID: I still can't sleep with them in my room . # ME: this summer I , oh I had to live with cats . # PM: Okay , Fenella ? # UI: , I drew a badger . # PM: Badger . Good choice . # UI: I dunno , they're grumpy and nocturnal and # ID: Are you trying to suggest something ? # UI: Well , a little bit like the Yes . # UI: And then , if you know Wind in the Willows badger . # UI: and then I don't know if you know Brian . # UI: He's Liverpudlian writer . # UI: , that kind of books . # UI: Badgers are cool in that one too . # PM: 'Kay . Look at my sad giraffe . # ME: No , that's good . # PM: No , no , no , it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur , but whatever . # PM: I don't know even much about giraffes , but I just love the way they look . # PM: They're just such odd creatures , you know . # PM: I like that they're so unique and individual , I guess . # PM: I don't know much about their behaviour or anything , though . # PM: Only seen a couple in zoos . # ME: You don't really have to , I mean , if you like 'em # PM: , but you can appreciate the way they look . # PM: Okay . Alright . # PM: Guess we're getting straight back into business here . # PM: the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro , and our profit aim is fifty million Euro . # PM: We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States , in Europe , in Asia . # PM: And our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote . # PM: So we're gonna talk for a little while . # PM: here are some topics that we might be able to discuss . # PM: Expe our experiences with remote controls , our first ideas about this new remote , anything that you can bring to the table for this project . # PM: You wanna start us off ? # PM: Anybody have anything to offer ? # ID: Well , we wanna make a multifunctional remote , One remote for everything . # UI: And everything being Wait , we have what , sound system , T_V_ , D_V_D_ , V_H_S_ , TiVo ? # ID: I think they'll be phasing V_H_S_ out shortly . # UI: But it's still there , so if po if we're gonna do it # ME: It needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal . # PM: They're never universal . That's right . # PM: Esp e especially if you buy a not big product , D_V_D_ player , say , usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the # UI: Or if it's not like a Sony , if it's like a I don't know . # PM: Something from Sam's club . # ID: So we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals . # ME: And what we need an insanely good instruction booklet , because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways . # PM: and another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product , how it feels in your hand . # PM: If it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't Nobody wants to buy those any more . # PM: They want the ergonomic ones . # ME: They want like the flashy lights . # ME: Oh like this came from Las Vegas . # PM: Ones that ones that look high-tech , too . # UI: But at the same time are simple . # PM: So that people like my mother can use it . # ID: What about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand ? # PM: Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that # UI: Just bad ones . # ID: What kinda battery would we want to use ? # ID: Because battery changing is usually # PM: Do some of them use triple A_s though ? # ME: some use triple A_s . # ME: So double or triple ? # UI: I guess then it's If we need to do triple A_ we can , but most people usually have double A_s around . # PM: But that has to do with the size of it too . # PM: Well , w as long as we know that issue is Here we can # ME: if we want it to be more thin , then we'd probably wanna go with a triple A_ . # ID: Can you with a small lithium battery ? # PM: it's okay , we don't have to decide about it now , just as long as we remember battery type and size is important . # PM: Anything else ? # PM: Moving along . # PM: we're closing the meeting . # PM: Next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes . # PM: Here's what we're going to do . # PM: you're going to think about the working design . # PM: What do you think that means ? # PM: And U_I_D_ , the technical fun functions design , making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do , the functionality of it , operating all those different things . # PM: And the marketing person , that's Courtney , is going to do the user requirements specification . # PM: I guess that means specifying what exactly the user is going to be looking for . # PM: I would think so . Okay . # PM: And you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while . # PM: Okay , so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting ? # PM: Okay . This meeting is officially over .
# PM: welcome to our second meeting . # PM: This is the functional design meeting . # PM: And I hope you all had a good individual working time . # PM: Okay , let's get started . # PM: Okay , here's the agenda for the meeting . # PM: After the opening I am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . # PM: And we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . # PM: Then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . # PM: gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control . # PM: And then we're gonna close up the meeting . # PM: And we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes . # PM: First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting . # PM: First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . # PM: And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . # PM: And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of 'Kay I'll just give you a minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes . # PM: well let's go ahead and , back , previous . # PM: So what I wanna do right now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did . # PM: Who would like to start us off ? # UI: I don't mind going first . # PM: do you have a PowerPoint or no ? # UI: it's in the should be in the m Project . # ME: Do you want us to do our PowerPoints now or # UI: You know you could you could do it yourself actually . # ID: Did you send it ? # PM: Save it in the project documents . # UI: Put it in Project Documents , # UI: the function of a remote control , as what we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera . # UI: some of the considerations is just for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , the channel going up and down , volume going up and down , and then mute , a mute function . # UI: And then functions for V_H_S_ , D_V_D_ , for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . # UI: And enter would be for like , you know , the menus . # UI: And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_ , whether that means like we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus . # UI: And we can decide if that's what we want , if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example . # UI: These are two examples . # UI: and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons , and I don't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . # UI: And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler , it's got volume , it's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it's also what is fast-forward is also like next on a menu . # UI: So you have functions that are d duplicating . # UI: And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . # UI: So that gives you two different kinds , a more complex and more simple version . # UI: And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? # UI: And what functions it needs to complete . # UI: , what are needed to complete insulation process , 'cause , you know , that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place . # PM: Very good presentation . # PM: You speak with such authority on the matter . # PM: Who would like to follow that one up ? # PM: Now , that we've discussed # PM: Do you want me to run it or you wanna # ME: , you should run it . # PM: Functional requirements . # PM: Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements . # ME: okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls . # ME: Seventy five percent think they're ugly . # ME: Eighty percent want they've are willing to spend more , which is good news for us if we make it look fancier , and basically w we just need something that really I mean there's some other points up there , but they it needs to be snazzy and it but yet simple . # ME: So that's really what we need to do . # ME: And we need we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high-tech looking . So # UI: And that meaning what ? # ME: They like I guess use the buttons a lot . # ME: It's from my research . # PM: Okay , what do you m # ME: My team wasn't very clear . # UI: Only use ten percent of the buttons . # PM: What do you mean by the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons . # ME: I think it's like the engineering versus user , whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex # ME: and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really . # ID: We only use ten per cent of our brains . # ME: It's a necessary evil . # PM: Ready for the next slide ? # ME: And so people say that they typically lose it , as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time , much like any small appliance like a cellphone , and they we need something simple , because most people , well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , and we don't want to go we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote , but I mean they do need to be able to identify it , and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is . # PM: It's very important . # ME: Yes , it is important for the remote control world . # UI: is that like your ergonomics like your hand movements or something ? # ID: Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ? # ME: that's what my web site said , # UI: Channel , volume , power . # PM: I think that's a pretty good guess though . # ME: , I would assume so . # UI: It's like if you're holding it # ME: I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts . # ME: But also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones . # ME: And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design , but it really needs to be simple . # ME: So saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly . # PM: User-friendly . # ME: Where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is . # ME: the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it . # ME: And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player , a TiVo , what exactly are we using it for , as well as the age range . # ME: So we need a hip , but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product . # ME: And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up-and-coming thing they really consumers are really interested in it , and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it . # PM: And so just to just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ? # UI: to just say , where are you , and thing beeps , you know . # PM: Oh , that'd be lovely . # ME: I guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme . # PM: Didn't they didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it # UI: It's kinda like what the remote phone used to do . # PM: Mm . Oh , that's true . # UI: You know like go to the base . # PM: We could definitely include that if we wanted to . # PM: If it's within our price . # PM: Are we ready for our last presentation , Amber ? # ID: I'm just trying to move it . # ID: 'Kay . I think it should be there , working design . # UI: Working design . # ID: 'Kay . I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating . # ME: Oh that's fine . # ID: okay , so method of our design , I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this . # ID: We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional . # ID: extra functions will probably need an additional chip . # ID: Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart . # ME: What exactly is a smart chip ? # ID: Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions . # UI: Well , how much extra would the additional chip be ? # UI: Is that gonna push us over our production costs ? # ID: I wouldn't think so , 'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a newer company . # ID: And they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap . # ID: nothing here . # ID: power source , I figured , batteries , 'cause they're easily available . # ID: Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s , sometimes three . # ID: it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself . # ID: a large on-off button , demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , so a large on-off button would probably be good . # ID: Selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the D_V_D_ player or the T_V_ or the stereo system . # ID: smart chip that perverts that permits , sorry , universal application again , something that'll allow us to skip over between devices , and that's kinda it . # ID: this is my fifty second design . # ID: Power source over here . # ID: We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch . # ID: extra bulb could just be for flashiness , subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the device . # ID: the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to . # ME: So what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ? # ID: This is just like a rough schematic . # PM: So this would be the front ? # ID: So this is the internal workings . # PM: So the red would be the front of the remote though , right ? # UI: , that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_ , but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance . # PM: The l the light up kind of # ID: so you don't have to stare at that infra-red , # ME: Like that we know the battery's working . # ID: 'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , okay , when I push this button , is it working ? # PM: It'd probably be lighting up the key too , # ID: We can skip that whole thing . # ID: So you can put it in the dark . # ME: , and that's good . # ME: We should make it glow in the dark . # PM: 'Kay nex R Ready ? # PM: Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though , you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button , you think . # PM: Anything else ? # ID: I think that that's a good idea , because you know that's one of the most important buttons . # UI: Well , should it be larger buttons in general , you know like the examples that I had , they were swi quite small . # UI: So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ? # ME: I think we should . # ME: Like I think that would be in a as in like in for the design , I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote , 'cause most remotes have small square buttons , I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles . # PM: Okay , let's talk about all of our We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let's wrap up this one , and I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint , 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . # PM: Wait , come back . # PM: let's go through this . # PM: New product requirements . # PM: First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote . # PM: We're trying not to over-complicate things . # PM: So no D_V_D_ , no TiVo , no stereo . # PM: It's not gonna be multi-functional . # PM: And we th need to promote our company more , so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote . # PM: We're trying to get our name out there in the world . # PM: And you know what teletext is ? # PM: in States we don't have it , but it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather , kind of sports , # PM: it's very bland looking , it's just text on the screen , not even # UI: it's like black , black and white kind of # PM: just black with just text . # ME: Like running along the bottom ? # ID: You can also get the kind of the T_V_ guide so # UI: It'll give you the sports . # ME: is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ? # UI: Except the entire screen . # PM: it's the whole screen . # ID: It's the entire screen is just running information at random . # UI: You can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment , # UI: you know it's like # ME: So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching ? # PM: But it's becoming out-dated now , because of the Internet . # PM: Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so Those are our new product requirements . # ID: So , do we have to include the company colour within that ? # PM: It's part of the logo . # UI: Company colour being yellow . # PM: What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting . # PM: So our target group is You mentioned older people ? # PM: Would it just be universal for everyone , you think ? # PM: Because I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically # UI: It's gonna make it nicer . # PM: non-technically challenged people are gonna use it . # PM: I mean they want something user-friendly , so # ID: Mm well , even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra , 'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them , then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons . # PM: Okay , so we want for our target group would we say , I mean , young and old , all age ranges , not kids obviously , Or kids ? # ME: kids need to know how to use a remote , I would think . # ID: Most of them will intuitively pick it up though . # ME: They gotta change between Disney Channel , Cartoon Network . # PM: so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range # ME: , I think we need it all . # PM: what about technic technical specifications , like how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ? # ME: I would say we should say dumber than the average person . # UI: We should go for the lowest denominator . # PM: So so they need no technical experience to operate # UI: High school educated . # ID: how 'bout little to no , because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no . # PM: And we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper . # PM: So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_ , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this . # PM: So if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes . # UI: Well it's channel , on-off button , volume , mute . # ME: Those are the most important ones . # PM: And we wanna keep I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down . # PM: Correct , because people only use ten percent . # PM: Hey , what else ? # ID: Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ? # PM: What do you A finding kind of device or # ME: we need a like homing device . # PM: , ho homing device . # ID: like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ? # UI: Oh right Tracking . # ME: Because people really are looking for a remote that's more high-tech . # ID: What if we gave it a charger ? # ID: And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger , and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you . # UI: But you got a base . # ME: Do you think people'll really go for that though ? # ID: It's useful for the remote phone . # PM: Would that add to our costs at all , I wonder ? # ME: I would think so , because you'd have to develop a base . # UI: Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery . # ID: Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually . # PM: I think we can make a decision about that later . # PM: we'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss . # PM: So that would include battery source Power source rather . # PM: Is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? # PM: And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that . # UI: Well , then we could If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled demo demographic . # ME: Well , th there's the people who desire speech recognition , there's the different demog demographics have different desires , I don't know if you guys ge # PM: You could we could hook it up . # ME: It wouldn't copy onto the thing 'cause it's black , but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition . # ME: So basically older people don't really care . # ME: It's really the people twenty five to thirty five . # ME: I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of T_V_ though . # ME: They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and # PM: And if and if we introduced it when they're this age , they're going to probably always buy a remote that has # ME: just sitcoms and stuff . # UI: Well , then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote , 'cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote , whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it . # PM: and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too . # PM: If we said , find remote , locate remote , or something . # PM: A certain phrase then it could beep . # PM: Just throwing it out there . # UI: Still fifteen minutes . # PM: Okay , anything else we wanna discuss ? # UI: Well , do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ? # UI: Can we conceive of leaving them out ? # ME: on the remote itself ? # UI: , like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero . # ME: Well , we definitely need those . # PM: how would you leave those out ? # UI: Well , I don't know , I mean , if you can like well # PM: Unless you could say the channel . # UI: I don't know , if there's just a way of leaving them out ? # ID: I think people would find that too foreign . # PM: And also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too . # ME: You definitely need # PM: I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . # PM: So I couldn't whenever I got cable , I had to get a new T_V_ . # ID: It's when we get satellite . # PM: get your own remote , or digital cable . # PM: I guess , we're gonna discuss the project financing later , making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . # ID: 'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so # PM: And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo . # UI: The colour being yellow ? # ME: I feel like a ye I feel like a yellow one would be too garish . # ID: R_ the double R_ . # PM: We could just have the logo in yellow , # UI: Can't make it entirely # PM: or maybe a yellow light for the keys . # ME: Or put like stripes , oh , yellow lights . # ID: yellow could be and it could doesn't have to be huge . # UI: Well if you have like a Hang on . # UI: If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ . # PM: So we've simplified , we don't need all those play , fast-forward , rewind , or no menu buttons . # PM: So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , the numbers can we go back to I'm gonna look really quickly back at those # UI: Two examples . # PM: examples and see if there is anything . # PM: Which one is yours , technical functions or functional requirement ? # ME: , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those like audio settings mono , stereo , pitch , screen settings like brightness , colour , or do we just want that accessed from the television itself ? # PM: I think that that's fine just for the T_V_ . # PM: I mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ? # UI: Well , the other option is sort of like down at the bottom , like farther away , you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much , but occasionally you will use . # UI: and so it's like # ME: , 'cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . # ME: It's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff , and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles it's tons of Spanish network television if it has English sub-titles it's definitely helpful . # PM: Couldn't we do that all through one button , something , a menu button , that pops up with a menu on the T_V_ that says , you know , audio , video , whatever , language , # UI: I don't well , I don't know . # ME: So we need up , down , and side-to-side buttons . # PM: For the menus . # UI: Well , that could be you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons . # UI: Channel is just up and down . # UI: And then add a # PM: Something that looks mayb you know . # ME: Such as , the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one . # PM: Y right , right . # UI: So we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed , including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now # PM: In the middle perhaps . # UI: included in the menu . # ME: I just got an idea for a design . # PM: Anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting ? # ID: I had something , but I forgot . # PM: get out of here . # PM: Let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next . Mm . # PM: After this meeting we're gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e-mail . # PM: And then we're gonna have lunch break . # PM: And after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time . # PM: I'm gonna put the minutes I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder , if you'd like to review them . # PM: And I'm gonna type up the minutes for this one as well . # PM: here's what we're each going to do . # PM: The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept , U_I_D_ the user interface concept , and you're going to do some trend watching . # PM: Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . # PM: And if anybody has anything they would like to add ? # PM: Okay , well , this meeting is officially over . # PM: Thank you all .
# PM: Hope you had a good lunch . # PM: Okay we're back for the conceptual design meeting . # PM: let's get started . # PM: 'Kay , here is the agenda for today's meeting . # PM: we're gonna open it and I'm gonna keep the minutes as Project Manager . # PM: We're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . # PM: And then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . # PM: And we have forty minutes again . # PM: 'Kay , and just to reiterate after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control . # PM: Let's go ahead and start off with your presentations . # PM: Who would like to go first ? # ID: Just trying to move mine right now . # PM: Courtney would you mind starting us off ? # PM: Trend watching ? # ME: Okay , so trend watching . # ME: since we do put the fashion in electronics , it is kind of important how our product looks . # ME: So I guess we can go ahead and go to the next . # ME: So what they want . # ME: Right now customers want fancy versus functional . # ME: basically about fifty eight percent of what they like of the product that they want , describing like the in order of how much they want , fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like , fancy versus functional , and then it has to also be technologically innovative , and yet easy to use . # ME: So the customer basically is confused . # ME: They don't know exactly what they want . # ME: They want us to tell them . # ID: They want everything , but simply . # ME: So we can go to next . # ME: So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing , shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns . # ME: So I don't know if we want to go with that and also the spongy feel is in contrast to last year . # ME: I don't know really , I mean I guess the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to rather than like a hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff , you'd want like a softer touch . # ME: I mean do you guys know what I mean . # ME: . But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , I don't know if we really want to go with that , because it is just a trend , and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months , # PM: People don't buy a new remote every so often . # ME: because I mean that could just be a Spring thing right now . # ID: I can address some of that issue , I think , with my presentation . # ME: Okay . Awesome . # ME: so design preferences , we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled so that , I mean 'cause we talked about that being a problem . # ME: and then also buttons illuminating upon touch , you said that in your design , with the bulb . # ME: and that could also tie in with the colour scheme . # ME: we need the Real Reaction logo and colour scheme obviously . # ME: That's one of our key goals , we wanna promote our product . # ME: And I was thinking about different types of designs and I came up with something . # ME: Actually right here . # ME: So what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone like this , where we put the buttons around , like we'd put a big on-off button or something else in the middle , I mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down , and then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape . # ME: 'Cause then it'll appeal to older generation and like said retro's cool . # ME: So it's classically retro . # ME: So I mean that's just an idea if you guys like it . # PM: Very good . I like it . # PM: Okay , ready for the next slide ? # PM: Great . Great presentation . # UI: See if it's there . # PM: Which one is it ? # UI: Interface concepts , # PM: Interface concepts new . # UI: Either refresh it , or it sh Oh wait , maybe I didn't put it there . # ID: Mine will always read copy of something or other . # ID: I copied mine before I sent it over . # PM: Oh there we go . # UI: looking at the interface concept , it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this . # UI: if you wanna start the next slide . # UI: can't really see , but there's two possible ways , on the r left , if you see on th on the sides of the remote , you have the sort of scroll down , so you have that option right there . # UI: And then also there's the idea of the base . # UI: That's sort of like an idea there . # UI: And then on the right , we have what's really big trend right now , it's the iPod . # UI: It's becoming really and so you have this sort of very simplistic menu section with the round buttons , and it's sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip , but also very sleek and very simple , but technologically advanced . # UI: So if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like using that idea in a remote control then sort of look into it , but Anyway , next . # UI: there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by sight . # UI: You'd you know you're in the dark , you don't wanna be looking at the remote control . # UI: And the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it's a V_ , and so yo you're kind of feeling a V_ like volume up . # UI: What it really is a V_ and what it you think it is down , because the down arrow . # UI: And so it's like a sort of a criticism you'd probably turn that o the other way up . # UI: but then you have you could either do it by raised type , which could be you know , iffy , sort of old-fashioned in a way . # UI: Either that or just have it by shape , for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow . # UI: And then the round ones you sort of feel by , you know , that's the second one down , that sort of thing . # UI: So it's sort of looking into how we wanted t to do it by feel . # UI: this is sort of an example of going for a s certain demographic . # UI: this is particularly geared towards children . # UI: it's very cute , and we could probably change it to yellow , bright yellow for like a the for the company logo . # UI: and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking . # UI: and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain channels that only these children would watch , so it's like they ch watch , you know , the C_ Beebies or something like that , keep them away from other channels . # UI: So that's like another ar , I mean , these are three examples sort of looking at it . # UI: You have the wider section for the main controls there . # UI: you could see how many buttons there are . # UI: And then on the left you have an example of the round buttons , and a simpler design . # UI: On the bottom we probably wouldn't need that , because it's more for like a D_V_D_ function which we are not gonna be using . # UI: So again it's sort of like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the R_R_ , Real Reaction . # UI: And then finally these are like the sort of same examples , but also some more , just possibilities that we could go with . # UI: None of them I'm particularly keen on by the way . # UI: But it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying , well out of this one we like , you know the round section of , b or we'd like the button size on this . # PM: Or I like , you know , the black finish or the silver finish or whatever . # ME: I have four of those remotes . # PM: What's the title ? # ID: It'll be copy of component design . # ID: Th that looks like it . # ID: So basic remote operation runs as follows , press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit , chip senses the connection , chip produces a morse code infra-red signal , specific to that button . # ID: So you press the button , it produces a signal that's encoded specifically for that button . # ID: Transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the T_V_'s centre , which interprets the signal response accordingly , changes channel etcetera . # ID: So that being said Next slide , please . # ID: Findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction , so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed , we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery y contacts , integrated circuit which consists of a diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and a capacitator , all those basic things that make a circuit function . # ID: fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself . # ID: An L_E_D_ , which is a light emitting diode , contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and a power-source , whatever power-source we've actually determined we want . # ID: Next slide , please . # ID: personal preferences , to save money for the components , the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought en masse . # ID: if we find another company who can produce the required chips , casing , L_E_D_ , any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing , we should go for it . # ID: Next slide , please . # ID: just talking to the manufacturing division . # ID: They suggested power options , solar cells , hand dynamo , and kinetic power , so you shake it and it increases the power . # ID: I'm not sure how the hand dynamo works , they have yet to get back to me on that . # ID: So next slide , please . # PM: Interesting . # ID: Suggested casing options . # ID: We can offer options for casing such as straight , curved , double-curved , you know , very specific to the customer . # ID: Options for materials , plastic , rubber , titanium , wood . # ID: I don't think anyone's gonna go for a wood one , because splinters # ME: That would be amazing , though , . # ME: No , splinters would # ID: certain restrictions do apply here though . # ID: latex , you can't do solar power with a latex one . # ID: So , if they want some a soft squishy rubber , they can't have the solar powered option . # ID: Double-curved , you can't do titanium . # ID: that would be two curvatures , so it would actually , if you the shape of your hand , you curve here and you curve here , so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold . # ID: Now if you wanted that , you can't do titanium . # ID: And so you functions what for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves . # ID: I think I have one more slide . # ID: the manufacturing division also has said that they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise . # ID: push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip . # ID: So depends on what we decide we wanna do . # ID: In addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote , we're going to have to have multiples of each type , like a double-curved in rubber , you know , each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options . # ID: So we'll have to mix it up , make sure we produce enough of everyone . # ID: But that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand , you know , double-curved wooden remotes . # PM: Okay . Alright , # ID: And that's all I got . # PM: well thank you for those informative presentations . # PM: Let's go back to Now we have to make some decisions . # PM: Where were we ? # UI: Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before , and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition . # ME: Oh this the thing we were talking about earlier . # UI: except that it's sort of odd , and I'm no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are , there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for So , you would say like , good morning , coffeemaker , and it would respond , good morning , Jill , I'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work , 'cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions . # UI: So does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question , and can't change it in order for it to be recognised , or can it be altered in a certain way , or does the actually user program it , to say a channel means this . # ME: like using the menu to be like , enter your name into the screen like on the menu options . # ME: So that way the remote reads it . # UI: so it's got like a limited memory and programme it . # UI: So it's sort of iffy , but that's kind of what you'd say . # ME: I feel like voice recognition would be , I don't know , w it would be too hard to really # ME: I mean we could do it , but # PM: If it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would , you know , technology # ID: Well , we are making the chip . # ID: So , I mean But , I guess , we have to look at w what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway . # ME: And it is a growing trend , the higher technological , like the , I mean just like the more advanced it is , the better it'll sell . # ID: I thought offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different , you know I think we'd have to decide on the power options , maybe . # ID: So that we could reduce cost . # ME: 'cause we need to know how big it's gonna be and how heavy . # PM: Okay , that kind of brings us to this , let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost . # PM: Do we wanna go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier ? # PM: The base , the charging base with rechargeable batteries ? # UI: I always feel like first I wanna know what it looks like , before 'Cause if it's something really small , then it's sort of harder to imagine a base for it , that was p quite a s substantial size sort of standing up # PM: and we don't have multiple things that it has to control , it just has to control the T_V_ . # PM: It's not gonna be a huge universal remote . # ME: We need to decide , well so we can figure how big it's gonna be , like exactly what buttons we want # PM: What size battery and # UI: Well , the other thing is like even if it's got a few buttons , so we want it to be bigger than this , # ME: and exactly It could be like this . # UI: 'cause it still fits in your hand , so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial , but not necessarily full of buttons . # ME: I'd , well This one is really comfortable , like I like the sides whatever , # UI: Are you gonna lose it easier ? # ME: because But if we have the , the locator , then we don't have to worry about that . # ME: So we can make it small if we have a l locating device . # ID: If we do a voice-activated locator , though , we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip . # UI: So i That's the other thing , it's like You know Are we gonna have certain chips that are gonna require bigger size period ? # ME: Two double A_s , for this size . # UI: But like , you know , if we get more complicated then it's gonna v be have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size . # ID: Honestly , I think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base if we did do a nice small , compact # PM: Right . I agree , it's either gonna be bigger with a base or smaller with just # ME: Smaller , without # PM: A battery like this guy . # PM: Alright , so what direction do you want to go in ? # PM: You wanna vote ? # ME: I think if we had a locating device with the small one , I think that seems way more advanced . # PM: I'm kind of I'm kind of leaning in the direction of this kind of # UI: I'm a away from the base . # PM: bigger and the base . # PM: That just seems so clunky and # ME: because I mean if even looking at cellphones right now , those trends the smaller the hotter it is , # UI: Smaller and smaller , . # ID: The only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash . # UI: You're kidding . # ID: You know it happens . # ID: I've had three watches go that way too . # UI: Oh watches I've but I've never washed a cell phone . # ME: A phone , whoa , that would wow , that would hurt . # PM: Okay , so what kind of material do we want to be made out of ? # ID: Pieces everywhere . # ID: Well , we have lots of options . # ID: I don't think wood is a viable option . # PM: Oh what did you # UI: Well , titanium s # PM: Oh sorry , go ahead . # UI: I was saying that titanium , if we're being restricted then I would probably lean away from that . # ME: 'cause if it's gonna cost us more to produce a chip , titanium will be more expensive . # PM: What would you recommend ? # ID: well , we only wanna sell it for twenty five Euro 'Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium , # UI: That'll , exactly . # ID: make them a rarity so to speak . # UI: The selling point , . # ME: We could do that , because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if # UI: Are we restricted by this ? # PM: I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.I'm # ID: Well the original # UI: Twenty five Euros # PM: not sure that we'll have the time and money to produce a whole array of remotes . # PM: If this was a successful remote , we might then produce a higher end version of it , I think . # PM: Okay , so we wanna go for plastic , or what would you recommend for materials ? # ID: Honestly I'd recommend like since we're going with batteries instead of solar power , I'd recommend maybe a soft like latex , because we could produce , you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour . # ID: We could do one that fits in with the trends of the year so , because this year is all fruit , God only knows why , # ID: we could do f a cherry cover for this year and then i if next year is stripes or solids , you know # UI: So you're talking about like when it leaves our salesroom then it's all gonna be cherry-coloured or is it gonna be the kinda thing where people come back and swap it ? # ME: O or we could like take off this . # PM: They could buy cases , maybe , # ID: They could come back . And buy the extra case . # PM: if they wanted . # PM: I think it's good to sell a basic thing and then sell options . # ID: So we could do like a b a hard base plastic , and then we could give two latex covers to start . # UI: what the top face , right ? # ME: because the soft latex definitely is squishy . # ME: Well I mean squishier than like , just a hard plastic . # PM: Okay , and what kind of chip would we need for this guy ? # ID: How complicated Are we gonna go with the voice activated # PM: I don't think we should do voice , I think we should just do the recognition for when it's lost , you know . # ME: 'Cause that what it type of , for voice activation would it be like a certain term what we would say like , because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time . # ID: Well , we could give it a specific code , you know , remote missing . # ME: see I'm strangely attracted to it , because I know that's it's definitely gonna be big , because it's , I don't know , it's just so high-tech . # UI: Well , my little sister got for Christmas she got one of those key finders that's like a key-ring , and you have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work . # ID: , see that would just irritate me . # UI: And then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse , and you couldn't turn it off . # UI: So it became highly irritating . # ME: then maybe voice # ID: So I think having a key-phrase is much better . # ME: maybe voice activation won't be good . # PM: Alright . But it's not gonna be voice activated in the fact that you would say , channel up , and it would work , # ME: , n no , we just want it to be a finder . # PM: Okay , alright . # ME: But do can your can the department make # ID: That would be like a mid-class . # ME: Oh , brilliant then . # ID: So we don't actually have to go for Well , if they've just developed the sample sensor , sample speaker , it's a brand new chip . # ID: Why not introduce it in this way ? # PM: and what size batteries , double A_ , triple A_ ? # ME: I think triple A_ , it'll be lighter . # PM: Could it run off of two # ME: I mean more come in a package . # UI: Well , that depends on what the energy is needed . # ID: I think , well , we could d r do two or we could do one small lithium , 'cause you know the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products , right ? # ID: So they're more widely available now . # ID: And they also have a longer battery life than most batteries . # PM: They're more expensive though , too . # ID: But if you only have to replace it every five years . # PM: Thoughts anybody ? # ME: That's a good point . # UI: As long as we sell it with it . # ID: Well , how about a initial , you get one battery when you buy it , # UI: Right , that's what I meant . # ID: 'cause I'm pretty sure we can get them pretty cheap on bulk . # ME: We could think about it and come back to it next meeting . # ME: We still have one more meeting . # PM: So we've covered that first category , User Interface Concept , meaning design . # UI: What's it gonna , what's it gonna look like . # PM: I ki I kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial , and that the central button could have , maybe our logo on it ? # PM: It might be the four way scroll , too . # ME: , it could be whatever , as long as there's something big in the middle , because like the old phones , there's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle . # UI: Well , my issue with that is if it got too big though , 'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle , then is it gonna get wider than your hands are , # ME: Oh , that's true . # UI: because w And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ? # ID: In the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side , which I think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand-shape like if we put the scroll-button on the side , # PM: Oh , I see what you mean . # ID: that could be particularly useful . # ME: So scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top ? # ME: But we definitely If we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have 'em labelled . # ID: Well , if it's just up and down # ME: like on the side of it . # ME: Oh if it's just up and down . # UI: But is that for # ID: Volume or channel . # ME: Well , you could do some on both sides . # UI: Do we have both sides ? # ID: We should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then , # PM: So that you're just not holding it and it changes the chan # ID: 'cause oth otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this , you know . # ME: That's squishy . That's squishy . # UI: Well , the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side . # ME: have buttons . # PM: 'Kay any other ideas ? # PM: Oh , . Latex covers . W # ID: We have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on , so we'll have to like have a little square or something , so that the our logo's available . # UI: Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the R_R_ like that . # UI: And that's at the bottom of it . # PM: I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though , because if people are able to change the covers , # UI: Which button ? # PM: I don't know , maybe the on-off button , something , some the menu button , I don't know , but you know if we're gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get another one . # PM: Are they all gonna have our company logo on them ? # ID: , I don't think we should do that , because that would just be icky . # ID: So I think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea . # PM: If we want it to be visible and are all those one that you showed where they were s met silver-metallic looking ? # PM: But those are plastic , right ? # PM: They're not titanium . # PM: I kind of like that look . # PM: but , or if it was really # ID: For our base one ? # PM: , for the base or if we're going for the retro look , I think , like a really shiny black would be cool . # PM: What are your thoughts ? # ME: or like a gun-metal grey , # PM: Gun-metal gray . # ME: 'cause then it combines the silver and the black . # PM: There you go , gun-metal gray . # UI: I'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button . # ID: It'll wear off . # UI: What's the button # ME: , buttons wear off . # UI: Well , w then what's the button do , and how do you know that is what the button does ? # UI: I guess . Just looking at examples , y you just don't ever see the logo on a button , it's always on the actual casing . # ID: There's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual # ME: But we want it to be seen . # UI: But , you don't see it . # PM: Visibility though # ME: We need it to be seen . # PM: 'Cause if it was only on the back really the only time you're gonna see it is when you drop it or when you're changing the battery . # UI: The other option is , I don't know if you can see it but it's like if # PM: I can find it again . # UI: it's like the second to last slide . # PM: And yours was called Interface Concept ? # PM: Well , for some reason I can't get it to just go to that slide directly . # UI: Okay , it's the very right one . # UI: You see at the bottom , it's kind of difficult to see , but you have like a d sort of s division between the bottom like , where the logo is , and if we have the replaceable section , it's like the top . # UI: It doesn't necessarily replace the entire top . # UI: And so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in . # UI: If c you envisioning it ? # UI: And so that stays the same when you have the logo , and then you have this s slip that kinda clips in and that's the bit that changes . # ID: The only problem is we're using a latex overlay so it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons , so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be . # PM: Like a little cut-out kind of # UI: That's like , you know , a cellphone it's like the screen is always just left opened . # UI: And so , what we are gonna do it like bright yellow with the R_R_ ? # PM: Anybody see anything that they liked in these ones ? # ME: Some of tho Well , some of those buttons though are blue-based . # ME: well , a lot of those buttons are blue-based . # ME: and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow . # PM: Yellow , I like that idea . # ME: Like if we like the one all the way on the left , you ca you can see it on your computer better . # ME: where the button is actually blue , but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow . # ME: So we'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons . # PM: I like the yellow illumination idea , very good . # PM: Any other ideas or thoughts ? # PM: We all seem to be fairly in agreement about what we wanna do with this project so # UI: Ha hang on Let me catch up . # UI: Did we finalise what buttons we're including or we just everything that we said before ? # PM: I think there will be time for that later . # PM: 'Kay , well we're gonna wrap this up . # PM: next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes , and here's what we're each of us going to do . # PM: The I_D_ is going to do the look and feel design , the U_I_D_ the user interface design . # PM: I think you're going to get a lot of , I mean , the final say on what buttons get put We'll all talk about it , but I think , that's pretty much what you're gonna do , I guess . # PM: 'Kay . And you're gonna do some product evaluation . # PM: Okay , and right now , the I_D_ and U_I_D_ , you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . # ID: Great . Play Doh . # PM: Okay , and you should all be getting an email pretty soon . # PM: Well , thank you for a very productive meeting .
# ME: I wanna find our if our remote works . # PM: Okay . here's the agenda for our last meeting . # PM: after the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . # PM: Then we're going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , let's get started . # PM: let's have the prototype presentation . # ID: Y you read that stuff , since you wrote it . # UI: Well , since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , I'm just gonna translate what this all means for you . # ID: I'll be the Vanna . # UI: The base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , and it's gonna be plastic . # UI: then there's the latex cover , which is what you see as red . # UI: because it can be replaceable , we just kinda went with the colour . # UI: and then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top . # UI: and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue , almost see-through . # UI: It's just sort of a very pale blue and a light-up yellow . # UI: The whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it just that one button will light up . # UI: and then at the bottom we have our logo . # UI: bright yellow sort of design with the R_R_ which will actually look like our logo . # UI: And then on the side you have the buttons . # UI: They're one button , but they kind of push up and down . # UI: I don't think they're scrolling . # ID: They're just buttons . # UI: And then , the buttons . # ID: On off switch will be here and as you've noticed on our prototype they've ended up with a curvature kind of , by concave sort of thing , except for , you know , can't see underneath . # ID: So I'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that , because they're very nice to stock you know , stick your finger in . # ID: the two squared buttons are two probably least used , menu , mute , # UI: Thumb-shaped . # ID: and then these are the numbers , so our channel and our volume will be on either side . # UI: And then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top , just which we didn't do . # PM: And did you determine the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand , is it gonna be a single or a double ? # ID: I'd say a single . # PM: Single sounds good , # PM: 'cause it's not big enough to really constitute a double . # ID: it's only actually the size of my hand . # PM: I think you did an awesome job . # ME: , I think it's a beautiful # PM: It is beautiful , and it's everything that we discussed . # ME: Good job , you guys . # ME: Those are really good . # PM: Alright what's next in our agenda ? # PM: we're gonna discuss the evaluation criteria , and that's with Courtney . # ME: it's a PowerPoint presentation . # ME: I don't really know exactly what we should talk about . # ME: It's under evaluation . # ME: so these are the criteria we're gonna ask , is it easy to use , is it fashionable , I guess we should write these down so we can reference them . # UI: Feel good meaning what ? # ME: Like does it feel good , like # ME: That's just for current trend . # ME: It doesn't really count , you guys . # ID: , it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it . # ME: But it's so we do have removable covers , right ? # ME: , well then that's covered . # ME: And so we n k everybody have that ? # ME: Okay so , we're using the criteria for a seven point scale , and so we need to discuss how we feel . It falls within this range , so for easy to use , do we feel it's very easy to use ? # PM: Are we going to indi # UI: True or false , easy to use . # PM: I say we individually rate what do you say ? # PM: We have easy to use . I vote six . # ME: Oh wait , that's false . # ID: I'd say two as well . # ME: Two . That's what I say . # PM: hello , we're great . # ME: Okay , fashionable ? # ID: At the moment , no . # ME: I mean like no , I think it's very fashionable . # PM: Me too , very chic . # ME: I thi I would give it a one . # PM: One , I give it a one . # ID: I'll give it a two , because at the moment it's not looking that way . # PM: Oh , and ma it's a prototype , # ME: Well , that's just like that's a clay , it's a prototype . # UI: Mm I don't think it's that fashionable . # ME: What do you think ? # UI: I'd give it like three or four . # PM: So , the average is about a two . # UI: But then I'm not fashionable , so # PM: Two point five . # UI: don't use my opinion . # ID: Neither are all o all the customers we have , either . # ME: does it feel good ? # PM: Imagine , since we obviously don't have that . # UI: Does it feel good ? # ID: the shape of it actually does . # PM: And it's i it is very ergonomically designed . # PM: It's gonna be curved . # UI: it's gonna be thicker . # ME: I think it feels good . # PM: I think so too . # ME: I'll give it a two . # UI: I'll give it a one . # ME: What do you say ? # PM: Alright , average is two . # PM: Is it technologically innovative ? # PM: Oh sorry I'm taking over your job here . # ME: Oh no , it's fine , # PM: Go right ahead . # ME: you're I mean you're Project Manager . # ME: , I mean and it does it have voice I mean the phrase recognition on it ? # PM: We were able to do it with that kind of chip . # ID: We could do it with the chip , yes . # ID: It wasn't we have no reflection of it on the prototype , # ME: And there's no way you can represent it on here . Y # ID: but that's because it's only two dimensions , really . # PM: That was And we discussed that being included . # ME: Then yes , then I would well it isn't what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative ? # PM: Well we don' have the you know , we can't say channel , and it changes the channel , channel eight . # ME: And it doesn't cover anything other then T_V_ , so I'd probably give it a three . # ME: Even though it is for just a T_V_ remote it's very advanced . # ME: But it is just a T_V_ remote . # PM: I'd go for a three or four on that one , so # PM: let's go for a three point five . # ID: Three and an half . # PM: Alright , and the last criteria is it is it # UI: Squishy and fruity . # ME: Well , so I'd give it a two . # PM: Well , we've covered that with the # UI: It's just trendy , basically . # PM: Sure . Capable . Very capable . # ID: It's capable of being squishy and fruity . # ME: Oh , it's very capable of being squishy and fruity . # PM: And it's very important . # PM: 'Kay , there we go . # ME: So our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner , and hopefully we'll sell millions . # ME: Good job , team . # ID: How did you get that in there ? # ID: The slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie . # ID: That was good . # PM: Alright , let's go back to this No , that's it . # PM: Okay , so now we're moving on to finance , I'm gonna show you an Excel spreadsheet and we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under twelve fifty Euro . # PM: If so , we can proceed , if not , we need to go back to the drawing board a little bit . # PM: 'Kay ? So let me bring that up . # PM: it's not hand dynamo , it's powered by battery , so we give it a Number of components you plan to use . # PM: Do I just put quantity being one battery , or But if it's a do you wanna go for this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s , 'cause triple A_s we're gonna have t do more than one battery . # PM: Oh , let's just go for a lithium . # PM: What do you say ? # ME: , let's do a lithium . # PM: I think I think the people who purchase this are gonna be technologically # ME: We're gon that's gon Nologically advanced , # PM: Okay , down to the electronics section . # PM: We're gonna need this kind , correct , if we do the voice sensor , so one of those . # PM: It is a single-curved , so one of those . # PM: , that's correct . # PM: 'Kay , down here , case material . # UI: And special colour . # ME: And special colour . # PM: Down here , interface type . # PM: We're gonna have the integrated scroll wheel . # UI: No , we don't have the scroll . # PM: oh those are just regular buttons . # ID: Well , that's the push-button too , right there . # ME: But it's but i so i # ID: Integrated scroll-wheel or push-button . # ID: We're really having just push-button interface . # PM: so we can just go . # ME: But will we w actually we'll need two , won't we ? # ME: One for the top and then one for the s one e for each side . # ID: But it that just covers the type of button we're having . # ID: Because we're not doing a scroll on the side , it's still push-button . # UI: Oh like the twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and # PM: Right I think she's # ID: But we just have push # UI: push-buttons . # UI: But we don't have any scrolls . # PM: I think what Courtney's talking about is do we need to put two here ? # ME: Like because there's like one interface right here and then because it's not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button . # ME: There's gonna have to be additional signals on the sides . # ME: So is that gonna be an extra one on each side ? # PM: I don't know , they might put us well , let's just . # UI: Two interfaces , is that what w should we s say ? # PM: Two or would it be three ? # ID: Let's call it th # ME: Or three , because of one on each side and one on top . # ME: I mean it's fine 'cause it comes out the same as twenty nine . # ME: Well less than twenty nine even . # PM: and we're gonna button supplements the buttons are no # ME: They're a special colour . # ME: they're a special form , 'cause they're indented . # ME: And , they're a special material . # PM: Mm . Well , we're under cost then . # PM: No , we're under . # PM: Twelve point five is our limit . # PM: We've got eleven point two . # ID: So we can go to production . # PM: We can go to I dunno what I just did . # PM: Now we're gonna talk about the project process and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result . # PM: did we have a lot of room for creativity ? # PM: Did we have a lot of room for individual leadership , teamwork , and the means , meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there , and if we found any new ideas . # PM: Now , question is , how do we do this ? # ME: I think we just discuss it . # PM: Discuss , sure . # PM: Who want who would like to go first ? # ID: We think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself , in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote , initially . # UI: We didn't have a whiteboard . # ME: Oh that's true . # UI: And no internet . # ME: No , that's a good point . # ME: 'Cause I'd forgotten that wasn't our decision , . # PM: And how did you feel about the whole the whole process though ? # ME: Oh , overall I mean I thought we did a good job like We got to choose basically we had control over minus it being just merely a T_V_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it . # PM: and we got say over what how technologically advanced it should be and also how fashionable , which I kind of like # ME: And we're a fashion forward technology company . # PM: what about the teamwork aspect ? # PM: How did you guys enjoy making the model , the prototype ? # UI: I think we did well . # PM: I think ya' did . # PM: Did you work well together in there , and # ID: Well , no , there was there was scratching and fighting , but no . # ME: Minus that one fight . # PM: Oh my God , and we've all been a pretty congenial team here , I think . # PM: We hadn't had any ma fallings out . # ME: I mean minus you guys being wha what is it , the survey , annoying or what is it ? # ME: Wow that's a it's definitely a strong one . # ID: The means , the whiteboard didn't work . # UI: And no internet . # PM: I have to knock that one down a couple notches . # ID: A and our friend here really feels strongly about the internet . # ME: , and no internet . # UI: There's so much available . # ME: And the digital the digital pens # UI: Like it's information # PM: , digital pens . # ID: I really appreciated those , . # ME: they were pretty cool . # PM: They were fine . # ME: they were fun , even though I'm not really sure what I could do with them , but they are awesome . # ID: The use of the laptops for receiving everything . # PM: Right , laptops are extremely handy , # ID: It was wireless too , so . # PM: And that we have a shared network where we can put all of the # ME: And these things whoa . # ID: And let's not forget the sexy dual microphones everyone gets to wear . # ME: And Big Brother . # PM: 'Kay , have we found any new ideas through this process ? # ME: we are really gonna sell this . # PM: For something that looks cool and also has what I want it to b do technologically . # PM: And that's your right brain taking over , w wanting the artistic , the fashionable , the hip , you know . # PM: If we all just went out and bought useful things , I don't think I mean that's not what technology . # UI: Well , that's why I don't like Macs or Apples , just 'cause I look at it , and I know it's probably a very good computer , but I look at it , and I'm taken back to elementary school , 'cause they look the same . # UI: They look like they did when I was in elementary school , and that's so old-fashioned to me . # ME: , 'cause they're pretty and just like # ID: The Toronto district school would only use his Macs with their kids . # UI: Exactly , so I associate them with like really low-tech , really cheap , bad # PM: Just the Mac font bothers me even . # PM: But I do like iPods , go figure . # ME: , no , iPods They want all those words for presentation , even the plugs . # ID: Well , i iPods are now quite trendy , and they come in different colours . # PM: I mean how many people went out and bough a Nokia phone , back when we were like in high school , just so they could get the changeable face plates . # ME: Oh , everybody . # PM: Anyway , so that is definitely at work . # ME: Mine is amber . # ID: I didn't have a phone 'til university . # UI: But the my but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only . # UI: I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs . # PM: Fashionable chic people will . # UI: You're kidding . # ME: That is a piece of work . # ME: Marketing Director says . # UI: No , marketing has to actually create the desire for it . # ME: Fashionable people will buy it . # ME: Oh , I will create desire . # ID: We can create a commercial where they think that all their needs will be met . # ID: This will help them find the one . # UI: Ri They'll be sexy with it . # ME: We could have like an Adam and Eve type commercial , and that's the fig-leaf . # ME: Mm . That'll sell . # ID: And so the serpent says , use our remote . # PM: There you go , marketing . # UI: Let you loose . # PM: Okay , we're gonna wrap this up now . # PM: the costs are within the budget , we evaluated the project , and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary , and then we're going to have a big giant party , apparently , according to this , so . # PM: Alright , thank you team , # ID: Whoohoo . Margaritas for everyone . # PM: you did a great job , it was lovely working with you . # ID: Thanks to the Project Leader .
# PM: w welcome to the first meeting of Real Reaction's development meetings for our new television remote control . # PM: this follows our very successful entry into the consumer market over the last year or so which we want to build on , taking advantage of the latest developments in technology and the latest feelings in consumer design and demand and we want to make this the very best product th that's possible for everybody , one that everybody wants , at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company . # PM: and to that end we need all to work together to do that . # PM: and b in no particular order because ev everybody is just as vital to this project I'll just go round th the table , Andrew , marketing , m Kendra with the designing the User Interface uh and Kate with the industrial design . # PM: What's the th project is here to do , is to get this project up and moving , ev everybody is free to say wh whatever they want , everybody has a contribution to make and everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to say what you want to say . # PM: in terms of the immediate meeting the everybody knows everybody else , everybody's worked for the company for a while , if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves please do , if anybody wants to b briefly give their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody everybody's experience is please do so . # PM: in fact I'd welcome anybody to say something briefly about themselves , in fact we will do that by going round the table quickly and saying what contribution you you're looking to make . # PM: So we'll start with Andrew . # ME: my name's Andrew I'm a I'm the Market Research person for this for this meeting and this project for creating this new remote control and I'll be presenting information statistics on what people want to want to get from this new design , what people want to like and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view . # UI: I'm Kendra and I'm the Us User Interface Designer and I haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before but I'm m I'll be working on the design . # PM: at least means you haven't got any preconceived ideas # UI: I'm just open to being creative . # ID: I'm Katie , I'm the Industrial Designer and I'll just be I guess presenting about the inter workings of our little remote control # PM: very quickly , this I don't want to make this meeting too structured because the whole idea is that it's a you know a think tank . # PM: Everybody says what they what they want to say , and we don't want to be constrained by kind of convention or uh slides on screens or anything else but briefly th this is what we want to do . # PM: The the remote control needs to be original , there has to be something about it that other remote controls don't have so that as soon as people see it they think yes that's different , I want one , and that goes along with being trendy , uh you know the I want it scenario . # PM: User-friendly as we all know , remote controls can be uh very user-unfriendly so we want to make ours one that people can pick up and think oh yes that's it's obvious how that works , and they also want to look at the price and think oh that's something that I may not need another remote control but it's such a nice one I'm gonna have one . # PM: And last but not least , or indeed first of all , it must make the company money , and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants . # PM: The the further work to be done is i the functional design , what it what it must actually do , the conceptual design , how we actually present that to the consumer and th the detailed design i is how we get that into production . # PM: now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is the white board and uh let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here , In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the wires , that we don't do that , everybody knows what whiteboard is so we'll do a virtual drawing on the on the whiteboard of your own uh favourite animal , but le let's go round the table , your favourite animal . # ME: it's got nice contrast with black and white and I feel they're underdog kind of status # ME: and they're , the # PM: my wife says my beard looks like a badger's arse 'cause of the white streaks in it . # UI: probably a duck # UI: I just I li I like the way they look and they're just nice animals and I like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever . # ID: 's horses , no particular reason why . # PM: I'm not sure that I've got any favourite animal to be quite honest , I think homo sapien because of their overall ability to uh # ME: Make mobile phones and T_V_ remotes to make T_V_ remotes . # PM: Indeed absolutely yes , tha that's and w we need to keep in mind here that the we want to sell this for twenty five Euro , we want to m make an overall profit for the company of fifty million Euros so we're looking at selling a lot of these ag across the entire planet and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent . # PM: It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make . # PM: so we're not only looking at a very trendy original product , we're looking at making it at a very good price . # PM: would anybody like t like to start by giving their o sort of quick views of current remote controls . # UI: I think I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and it's handiest when you have one that works both the D_V_D_ player or whatever and the T_V_ as well . # UI: , but that it's easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons so I think it's is best when they're clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use , you know . # PM: Any any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the p the problem ? # PM: Or anybody else , strong feelings about remote controls ? # PM: Are there you know , bad ones they've used or good ones they've used or ones that they've lost and never found again ? # ID: I think it's important that you should be able to when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself and twist your remote control to get it the T_V_ to actually pick up the signal . # ME: Think a lot of the time , remotes that come with T_V_ players and T_V_s and D_V_ players , like they aren't like an area that's put a lot of effort into , they're very boring , very plain . # ME: it's very a very making a stylish remote control would be a very like Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition . # PM: what so wh what's in what particular style features are you thinking about ? # ME: Something that looks doesn't look like remote control . # ME: So if you want , something that looks like something that makes you think oh what's this ? # ME: Like this pen doesn't really look like a pen , but it makes you think oh . # ME: that's a bit vague . # PM: I mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control , people won't see it as a remote control # ME: I suppose that's up to the marketing to make people aware of the product . # PM: Any other thoughts about th the physical appearance of a of remote controls ? # UI: I think something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things and they're kind of awkward to hold onto , so something that's more comfortable that fits in a person's hand better . # PM: I mean th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer mouses which I mean y you get all sorts of shapes in the shops and s you know some quite fancy ones than the some from personal experience which look nice but aren't particularly comfortable . # PM: any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or uh # ME: from the mouse idea you could , remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press , whereas if you want could all be flat and the buttons are very kind of almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device you push into device you see , like a mouse button . # PM: I mean the only thing is if you're watching television in a in a darkened room you need to be able to # PM: fi find the button buttons easily . # UI: But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down so you could feel them better . # PM: must admit I don't think I've ever seen one with concave buttons , that's certainly be different . # PM: do we need it to I can't think of any re remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all . # PM: Do we do we want # ID: Mm that would be good . # UI: Like a like a mobile phone ? # ME: Mm , that would be good . # PM: Okay . So , Andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something which there are already millions out there and that we want to uh t take over the entire the planet with ? # ME: , especially if we try to sell , what two million of them . # ME: Oh sorry , four million of 'em , but I think if w if we market it as not as not this you c you could either market it as the point of view we could have the two we could have parallel marketing s schemes where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool , is fashionable and like you just it's like it's one that rather than ra I wan I want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device , but that might considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having a device that they just looks nice , therefore they want it so make it practical at the same time . # ME: I think it's this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room but also a device that is practically sound . # ME: I dunno we'll have to decide which angle we're gonna go to or both . # PM: I d I think an any facets that we identify w we aim need to aim for all of . # PM: okay well first thoughts on the industrial design side . # ID: I think it's remote controls are kind of a unique object 'cause it's you depend on them so much , but you don't i it's you sort of just assume they're always gonna work , you don't think of them as a comp like a computer can break down and you're kinda like oh well fair enough there's all these complex things going on , it's gonna something's gonna get messed up eventually . # ID: They they just need to be very dependable because people sort of take them for granted and then if your remote control breaks it's God forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel # ID: it just it needs to be very effective , very always dependable . # ID: I don't think we should make it too small I 'cause I think it needs to it can't be too big like you were saying big an and huge and awkward , but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller , it's just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and . # ID: dependable , and have a good medium range size . # PM: and colours , materials ? Kendra , anyone ? # UI: most I think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey , so maybe we should go with something different or be able to I was just thinking of what they're doing with mobile phones now how you can get the different what are they called ? Like the face-plates that you change so we could have maybe I don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that , where you can change the face-plates or have kind of a variety so people can get different things . # UI: Have it kind of look how they want to , different colours , things like that , probably just plastic because that's always the lightest . # PM: Again I don't think that's ever been done before , it's the sort of the sort of thing that would get people thinking yes that's something that I haven't got and might need Andrew , any thoughts about how we might market interchangeable fronts on the remote control ? # ME: we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour or with like you buy it with several you ge you get the f the face-plates with it when you buy or as a separate thing , but maybe thinking of that , it's considering the nature of the device , maybe a second thing like a second campaign to market new facials for your to your might go a bit astray since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one and then forget about it . # ME: Unless you were trying to # ID: you could come up with like novelty ones , like they've done with the mobile phones , you can get like different you know scenes from different movies and stuff on the remote control and sorta stagger the release of them # ME: that's a that's a good idea . # ID: and get people like oh I want that cover on it now and that'll keep them spending money . # PM: Right , okay I think we've got a good idea now . # PM: meeting is Needs to be k wrapped up fairly quickly . # PM: we've got thirty minutes to start looking at the at the design in more detail . # PM: then we'll we will reconvene in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas uh more formalised . # PM: thank you very much indeed .
# PM: welcome to the second meeting of this design group . # PM: I'll briefly go through the notes of the of the last meeting just done in note form and I haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as a team here and n nobody's working equally , we s we saw that the problems with existing remote controls were the b a boring shape and boring colour . # PM: and we s we saw that the what we needed to do was to make sure the device controls several items , that switching was easy , that you shouldn't need to point the thing at anything in particular , that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of . # PM: should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it , illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms . # PM: and that people might want it as in addition to their existing remote controls . # PM: and that it sh it should just always work , whenever you mm use it . # PM: And that it shouldn't be too small , mm that it gets lost . # PM: I'll shortly ask for three presentations . # PM: before I do that , however , I will go through some new project requirements that the management have placed on us and will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting . # PM: the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and the they don't necessarily agree with what we thought . # PM: and then we'll as a result of that we will then talk through the functions that we see the device actually b carrying out , and we have forty minutes to do this in Anyway . Okay . Now , the n the new requirements are the management team see that teletext is no longer of any importance given the rise of the internet . # PM: and they want it only to cover televisions . # PM: what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover , you know , videos , D_V_D_s , satellite boxes , which I mean we saw as being fundamental to the to the exercise . # PM: The the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only . # PM: and on that basis I think we need to bear that in mind , but possibly keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they no longer they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things . # PM: the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours . # PM: the logo being at b the bottom of the screen there , the two R_s in grey against a yellow background . # PM: this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market . # PM: But do introduce some constraints as to how we might do that . # PM: it also has to be simple , which to some extent goes along w with the first one , and that we've already said that it must be simple 'cause that's what people want anyway . # PM: but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly , which mm is their choice , but we need to talk that through . # PM: okay , so after the meeting it'll be summarised notes sent out and etcetera . # PM: Okay , so we'll first of all mm have individual reports from everybody . # PM: again I there is no order of precedence here so I I'll leave it up to you to who thinks they would like to go first ? # ME: can I steal the cable ? # PM: Oh sorry , you can indeed . # ME: how do I start there ? # PM: if you click on the one that looks like a projection screen , the one to the right of that . # ME: these are functionality requirements from the our guys down in the research lab . # ME: Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what is needed by people and what they want to see . # ME: everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . And general opinions about current remotes . # ME: See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . # ME: So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly . # ME: along with looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . # ME: Which is a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be more cost effective and we can put the price up . # ME: Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . # ME: I can empl I kinda take that to mean as they don't they , they only use they only work for the television as in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . # ME: If it was I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour . # ME: again , seventy five percent is seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . # ME: I took to mean that they just they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume . # ME: I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause wh if we got a remote that like we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but oh and we're going to see on the that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very aren't considered relevant by the user . # ME: So I think maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , I dunno . # ME: frustrations of like people losing remote control . # ME: I dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . # ME: Maybe like it'll beep or something . # ME: And , yep , the time taken to learn new remote controls is don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for new like first time users and stuff . # ME: And repetitive strain injury , I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use have to make it , fewer buttons , like I was saying about the whole mice the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . # ME: Maybe don't even have to hold it as such . # PM: must be some telly addicts out there if they get R_S_I_ from their television remote , is all I can say . # ME: It also asked if we would if people would pay more for speech recognition and younger people say they would . # ME: And there was another section on our on the report for L_C_D_ displays , but the data wasn't there , so . I don't actually know what the results for that were , # ME: May be incrementally emitting , # PM: I must say that the I c can't remember what f you know phone service I was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked remarkably well , so that is indeed a thought # ME: And it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you # PM: and it cuts out I was gonna say , you can't get a lot of R_S_I_ , j just get jaw ache . # ME: possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . # ME: I've got some other things I couldn't fit onto this presentation . # ME: . You see this okay ? # ME: Almost it's a bit . # ME: I'll read out to you . # ME: functionality , like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . # ME: like the power . Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used . # ME: You see what I mean ? # ME: Whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance is used the most . # ME: m we can maybe even start to cut down on or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . # ME: Maybe like a folding ledge or something . So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings , which are low relevance and rarely used . # ME: And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily # UI: It could be I was just gonna say maybe like the flip phones that they use ? # UI: Have you seen the new mo mobile phones that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , you could have the most used buttons on top and flip it out or something . # ME: like the one that like slides back # PM: . Should we actually bite the bullet here ? # ME: and the buttons are concealed underneath . # PM: If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all remove them altogether . # ME: Just remove them completely ? # PM: We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with # UI: That might be the # PM: I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , given that the age structure we were looking at I mean w we had usage by age structure , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . # PM: do we know whether they Forty no sorry for forty five to fifty five age group , to put myself right in the middle of it , u use remote controls to a great extent . # ME: this is for pay more for speech recognition . # PM: That would 've speech recogn right . # PM: we're looking at again , we don't know the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups . # PM: If we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it . # ID: the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . # ID: If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change . # PM: But if you just lift it up and say , channel one or B_B_C_ # ME: Or even I mean you could even just have it left on . # ME: You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and never have to # UI: have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box and have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , you won't lose it . # PM: I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , because if somebody actually on the television says uh , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then it might change itself , # PM: so it probably needs to be possibly actually need a button on it # PM: just to activate it . # PM: Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . # PM: And and then just say , oh I don't know , a thought and then I mean that would certainly be truly different . # PM: 'cause you know audio settings , nought point eight percent . # PM: I mean if they weren't there , would people miss them ? # ID: But look at the importance of them . The volume settings . # ME: Relevance of two out of ten , # ID: They're not used often but they are quite important when they're used . # PM: w we need to s identify things that people actually need and it's a function of frequency and relevance . # PM: And I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , the channel and volume and th w given that we've been told to ignore teletext . # PM: channel and volume are the only ones that would appear to be essential . # PM: if we can design something that looks interesting , or looks different , incorporates the logo and the colours and we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's the yellow and grey , and I dunno , buttons or buttons as an option . # ME: I just had a thought actually , sorry to interrupt . # ME: you were saying about it could technical problems of like someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed we could maybe have like an activation # PM: You cer certainly could . # ME: 'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before , where you just you address the remote , # PM: Depe i depends whether # ME: you address the computer , and then give it a command . # PM: if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say # ME: Oh I see . Oh , I see . # PM: I mean you could print actually print it on the device itself . # ME: I mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote . # PM: th this I th that's always gonna be a problem I think . # PM: and I s I suppose one could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one . # PM: Anyway , carry on . # PM: Do you want to just carry on with # ME: I interrupted you , # PM: no , no b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there . # ME: I was just kinda wrapping up there . # ME: I was thinking , maybe such things are relevant . # ME: We could make things much more f I think the eighty percent of people would spend more on a remote that looks better , combined with decrease the or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much . # ME: alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . # ME: But , since if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd it would be fashion and fashion over practicality . # PM: S s we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it # ME: we could even have it as like a the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , # PM: Certainly could . , . # ME: if we could power on and channel selection and volume selection , wouldn't have to really # PM: The I mean the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper . # ME: and probably it would look better as well . # PM: it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it , you know , visually very distinctive . # PM: 'cause you know , it does not have to be a oblong box . # ME: Lined with numbered buttons and # PM: have you have you finished there Andy ? # ME: , that's everything . # PM: given that we've already had a extensive discussion . # UI: Okay well , I can do mine . # ME: Do you want the cable ? # UI: let's see if I can make this work . # ID: you have to hit like function and F_ something . # ME: , give it about twenty seconds , or so . # UI: Okay , so this is just about the technical functions . # UI: the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and identify what the necessary things are , what people are what you really wanna have a remote control do . # UI: and then there are two different kinds that I found . # UI: There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be . # UI: these are the two different ones . # UI: This one this is the user centred , it has quite a few mm fewer buttons and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . # UI: So basically , what a remote control is you it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . # UI: And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the logos for the company and the colours . # UI: for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a you know , fewer buttons . # UI: we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . # UI: It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top , then that would be easier . # UI: we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . # UI: the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that . # UI: that's my presentation . # PM: can I I'm actually gonna use the it's gonna cause great technical problems over here . # PM: I'm actually gonna use the # UI: they probably clip to you . # ID: they might be movable . # ID: they're all they're not connected to anything on the table , you just leave 'em on and walk around with 'em . # PM: rather than the traditional in fact , I won't even go that far . # PM: something like this shape , you know , sort of something that you can that's sort of a more vertical shape , that you sort of hold in your hand , I'm trying to think uh l such as I mean something you hold up like that , possibly with a couple of buttons like that , but with the entire top with the , you know , the infrared or whatever source . # PM: so that you know , it's flying off in all directions , so that uh again the n need to look at the technicalities of actually achieving that in terms of whether the , you know , the power requirements of the such a source , you know , compromise the our need for you know , it being mm permanently you know , available . # PM: whether different technology I mean th all these remotes are presumably infrared , and like they have been for a long time . # PM: we possibly need to be looking at something different , you know , short range , not like the old radio remote controls where you'd change next door's telly when you change yours . # PM: but uh I think basically i if we're going for i if minimum number of buttons is our priority , then we should , as I say , r know , really bite the bullets and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum , you know , possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off . and nothing else . # PM: so that it can al it could almost end up like that , but again , except that you know the risk of losing it . # PM: anyway okay so Kate , wh what are your thoughts on this ? # ID: Which one does this plug into ? # UI: I think it's all there . # ID: I can't did you could you see it on you screen when it That's not cool . # UI: That's kind of strange . # ID: Anyways . alright , so I'll just do my presentation on the working design . # ID: Oh there we go . # ID: just at the m the whole sort of method of how the remote control works . # ID: the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system , the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ player or whatever . # ID: and it does this by well , you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages within the remote which will then be sent to the television , the D_V_D_ to tell that what to do . # ID: and you need a user interface , which controls the chip and thus the messages and the user interface is that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it . # ID: just general findings . # ID: what we need technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source , some sort of user interface , which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that . # ID: a circuit chip within that to control and send the messages and a sender and receiver . # ID: This is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for . # ID: this just kinda represents the energy source which feeds into the circuit chip which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch which would send signals f to a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between so it'll light up once we start once you start pressing buttons . # ID: also send signals to the infrared bulb , which will be the part that actually what ? Sends signals to the television . # ID: And then you've got your happy little T_V_ watcher there . # ID: my personal preferences I just think we need sorta big energy source that won't die out , perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in , so it'd constantly be charged , so you wouldn't have to be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you . # ID: a wide range sender-receiver , so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room , and the channel'll still be changed . # ID: also definitely a user-friendly interface and I think we've all sort of mentioned adding a locating device on it , so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions , as they inevitably do , you can find them easily . # ID: And that's pretty much it . # PM: it seems to me there are a number of fundamental decisions to make before we I think your point about the big energy source is a very valid one . # PM: I don't suppose we've got any statistics on the life expectancy of remote controls , particularly sort of independent ones . # PM: you know , the number of things you buy these days , which you know , have a lithium whatever battery in , that's , you know never needs replacing . # PM: perhaps we should have the disposable remote control , you know , one some sort of typical usage . # PM: You know , the battery will last know , five , ten years . # PM: By which time I mean when all's said and done , the digital television will be taking over in that time scale . # PM: uh p perhaps we should , know , reduce the , you know , the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment # ID: Just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years ? # PM: and if anybody manages to run it down , we'll give 'em a new one . # PM: it's , you know , it's what it saves in cost and you know there there's a it's actually a marketing gimmick . # PM: I mean it's hardly a gimmick , it's totally practical . # PM: so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by , you know , magnetic waves or whatever , if it # ME: It could have like know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time . # PM: Are are people really gonna use it though ? . # UI: people are pro # UI: I would think that people might forget # UI: I mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there , # PM: I mean I know that somei times my wife goes out in the morning and says oh I should have put the phone on to charge and then she's had those for so long that if she hasn't worked that out by now . # ID: 'Cause I only remember to charge my cell phone when battery dies . # ID: And that's pretty much # PM: When it wh when it's died is a problem . # ID: when it turns itself off , that's when I plug it in , # PM: what so wh what do we think about the permanent mm battery ? # ID: , think that's a good idea . # ME: That sounds pretty good , . # PM: you know , we are really going for the ultimate in ex external simplicity here . # PM: you know , cut cost within the manufacturing and you know , if we have a high tech interior , then that sh may well be cost effective . # UI: Do they make batteries that last that long ? # PM: I can't think of anything off the s top of my head , # ID: They usually have the little light source , # PM: but there are certainly things that you buy . I mean calculators for example . # ID: I dunno what the heck they're called , # UI: , they have that little solar # PM: Som well some do , # ID: , the little cells # PM: but there are battery ones that are you know , sort of permanently sealed . # ID: Most of them , don't they have sort of a combination of the two , when there is light , they'll work off the light , and if there isn't , they'll kick into this battery , so we can maybe do something like that whereas there is a battery , but if there's enough light , then it's using the light , so that it's not actually draining the battery all the time , but you will have the battery there for when you need it . # PM: , I mean th this needs going t into the technology a bit . # PM: I mean the actual time that a remote control is actually operating I would think is i is probably , you know , no more than minutes in its entire life . # ID: it depend if it's depends who who's using it , who's just sitting there clicking , # UI: some people are # PM: If , but I say if people are getting R_S_I_ from it then perhaps we're looking at the wrong market # ID: then they're clicking a lot , . # ME: like this market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used , channel selection a hundred and sixty eight # ME: times per hour . # UI: Wow . That's a lot . # PM: I must admit I hadn't I'd missed that . # PM: That does sound excessive . # ME: But then again , if you think it of the amount of , you know amount of use it's like That's it's less than a second , . # PM: that's right , and I don't I don't even know whether the I don't even know whether the s the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed , or whether it's just a sorta tenth of a second , no matter how long you press it for , I don't know I don't actually know . # UI: Though I think with digital T_V_ , like I know on my cable box , you're not supposed to do that because the channel can't keep up with it if you just press it like that , so you're supposed to use the menu and go through the different channels that way instead of # PM: Right , so I've got a message to say five minutes , I dunno how long ago that appeared . # PM: 'cause we're getting right , so I'd I need to sum up very quickly here . # PM: We're looking at extreme simplicity . # PM: We're looking at a radically different shape . # PM: Possibly no buttons at all , but if you can incorporate channel change and volume buttons in into the design , then that's fine . # PM: in the I mean the role of the of the user interface des designer becomes b you know more important here , because , you know , shape is no longer an a serious constraint . # PM: But we clearly only need th the main buttons , although , if clearly only need the main functions . # PM: I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition and the only buttons that I think we need are channel control , volume control and on off . # PM: it needs to incorporate the corporate logo , the grey and yellow colour scheme and there's no reason why we can't introduce interchangeable covers . # PM: d so does that accurately summarise what we've discussed ? # PM: We are doing just the television . # UI: I just have one question . # UI: are we doing just the television or are we doing so not D_V_D_ players , okay , okay . # PM: I think that's quite clear from the information that we've been given , # ME: like in the email of television only . In fact they're in the constraints email that I got . # ME: Didn't you mention the teletext , just television only ? # PM: th that's one I s that's one I sent you , which was my interpretation of the what came down from head office . # PM: That's that that's their view . # PM: Okay , so we can all give some thought to that for the next meeting , thank you very much indeed .
# PM: Thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh design group . # PM: I think we made some definite progress at the last one and come up with some interesting uh w suggestions for our new remote control . # PM: I'll again very quickly just present some notes of that meeting . # PM: the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better . # PM: they've got lots of buttons on them that people don't use and find difficult to learn . # PM: and people lose them . # PM: And We we thought that f for our new uh remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that people use . # PM: we want to go for a long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the uh the product and a shape that will be instantly recognisable , A_ as a trendy remote control , and B_ as a Real Reaction product . # PM: So that w when people are happy with that , they will they will want to buy everything else from us . # PM: Okay . So again , I'll we'll have the three presentations from the three of you and then we'll make a final a final decision . # PM: and the decisions that we need to make today , finally , are what energy source we want to use , whether i it is practical to use a long lasting one . # PM: And I think our discussion was around the fact that if we're gonna go for a long lasting power supply , then basically it's sealed for life and if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll give them another one . # PM: And it it'll be , you know , prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature that it's um , you know , for life , guaranteed for life . # PM: now the internal chip and this is where I need uh Kate's expert advice and given that th this has to go to market as quickly as possible d do we go for a custom designed chip ? # PM: Or or do we buy one off the shelf and programme it ourselves ? # PM: I'm n not an expert on these things , but presumably , there must be loads of 'em already on the market that we can modify . # PM: But that that's your area of expertise . # PM: And then the , you know , the overall design of the case is Kendra's field we had some discussions last time as to how we might go forward and we'll finalise those da today . # PM: and thi this is all linked in with the user interface , whether we p go for voice , buttons , or a bit of both . # PM: and then , you know , f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the s the look , feel and design , Kendra the ho how the user actually uses it and Andrew of course the product evaluation . # PM: And Kate and Kendra will be producing a model for us to look at . # PM: if we can have the three presentations again please , and p perhaps you'd like to start k . # PM: Oh I'm sorry , oh sorry . # ID: I'll just be talking about the components design . # ID: basically I just looked at what exactly do remotes do . # ID: basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command and then this is translated into light signals which are then seen by the T_V_ . # ID: the materials we're gonna need to look at the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip works in conjunction with a diode transistor or resonator , two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor . # ID: basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a connection within the remote that allows the chip the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a Morse code format . # ID: This signal's sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode which is then trai changed into a infrared light which is sent to the T_V_ and sort of seen by the T_V_ and which changes the channels . # ID: as for how we should end up using this in our remote t couple of main questions are the buttons . # ID: y the fewer buttons you have , I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need . # ID: however to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult and raise the production cost . # ID: That's something we should think about . # ID: Also we have to work within the company constraints , and the company has informed me via email that they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most cost-effective way of producing it . # ID: also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that will last the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea . # ID: we also need to look at the chips , v custom-designed versus off the shelf , and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all seem to have agreed upon . # ID: , however that's gonna cost more , but the off the shelf is gonna be cheaper and it's gonna be allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster , but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like voice activation , which haven't really been used much on remotes , so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to convert , so if we were definitely gonna go with the voice option we'd probably have to design our own chip . # ID: And that pretty much sums it up . # PM: can you just put that one back up again , please ? . # PM: okay , I mean inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive . # PM: Do we do we know by how much ? # ID: I don't actually have any price information , # PM: And and do we know how long it'll take to develop a custom chip . # ID: a lot longer than an off the shelf chip . # ID: we did the problem is the voice technology is not really highly developed , it's sort of still in an ex experimental form , so it would it's hard to predict the time . # PM: I think we need to make a decision here . # PM: given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply , that would appear to effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology . # PM: now before we go round everybody else , does anybody h have any have anyti ha anything to say about that ? # UI: I just have a question about that . # UI: does it make a difference if there are just a few commands , for example if you can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten and pre-programme say , you know , nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in say B_B_C_ four as your channel one , as your favourite , it's like to have a certain number of favourites # ID: just to incorporate the voice activation in it is sorta the trick . # ID: Once you've got the whole voice chip in there , then it's pretty much the world the sky is your limit , # UI: Then it doesn't matter . # ID: but to actually the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working . # PM: Cause I must say I find it slightly surprising given that , you know , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling . # PM: So I mean for slightly different well no , if you speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you , so bu I mean the this information is from is this is the internal company information , is it ? # UI: Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive , # UI: you know , hundred and fifty pounds or something . # UI: As opposed to the twenty Euros , twenty five Euros . # PM: , mm true , again but if it's without any without any p price informations that's difficult to decide . # ME: Also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them , not just that , so . # PM: It's like it's you can't 'cause mobile phones are expensive , you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is . # PM: But we don't know . # PM: given that the technology is not well developed and given that it's never been done before , th the double risk , perhaps we ought to stick to buttons , since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work . # UI: another thought I go ahead . # ME: I was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh like maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost . # PM: I mean do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project ? # ID: it's fundament well I mean I guess it it's something we've discussed since the sort of the beginning , so I th I think in our in our minds it's fundamental , but I don't know that the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that , so I think you have to # PM: I mean I think we # UI: I kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then maybe we should have it for the whole thing . # PM: I think that's # UI: And we've been talking about it the whole time . # UI: Anyway , I'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it . # PM: Mm , right , okay . # ME: it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative . # ME: From my presentation show , so . # ME: technologically innovative . # PM: Right , okay , Fine . Okay . # ID: that sounds good . Mm . # PM: it will have voice recognition # PM: if that means if that means we can't afford buttons but I mean b second question , do we need the five buttons for channel change , up down , volume up down and on off , just as a backup or just so that people can j just sit there pressing buttons ? # ID: , I would say we do , . # PM: d did you want to say anything ? # ID: that was it , that was it . # PM: Shall we move rapidly on to Kendra ? # PM: ra rapidly move the cable over . # UI: Is it gonna work ? # ID: it's thinking about it . # PM: it'll get there . # UI: Okay . Okay , so I did some research on the internet you know , the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users , commands and mechanisms for the operation , and there're just kind of a variety of choices . # UI: findings , a lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just a couple examples of different kinds that are a little bit more unusual . # UI: There're some special ones available , like this one right here , which is marketed towards children , different designs , # UI: and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a V_ in volume because people some Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like . # UI: just kind of minimise the clutter , avoid too many buttons and also one of the things that people have used is a slide button , like you have on a mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , for example , have the slide button on the side , and then you can pre-programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator . # PM: if I can interrupt you . # PM: do you wanna say anything about slide controls ? # PM: I mean I think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're si simple , cheap and reliable . # ID: I think they're about the same cost really . # ID: I mean , I think it's just sort of the there's a lot of slide buttons out there . # ID: I think it's pretty much the same sort of connection . Mm . # PM: Okay , fair enough , fine . # UI: Just because I n for example if I'm using a mouse I like to be able to slide it up and down so I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down # UI: and then the this is my great little drawing . # PM: So three there's three buttons on a slider . # PM: Three buttons , channel up channel up down and # ME: if you g if you if you got a channel up down , we can have a slider in that as well . # ME: Because if it if you no if you notice on the thing it kind of like has got kind of if you know it s kind of like sticks , if you know what I mean , up like one unit , if you see what I mean . # ME: So it kinda goes up one , then y like you can keep rolling it up , but it's like a cog or something . # ME: So you kinda take it up one at a time . # UI: The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons , like the buttons on one side for the channel , and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand , and you pick it up , it's easy to n s know , okay , this is just the volume and this is the channel . # PM: This one on the one side and one # ME: you could you could as l as like a mouse you could # ID: 'cause I've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa , so it'd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different . # ID: You'd know what you were fiddling with . # PM: or th the I mean thi this is what the # ME: like the shape of it almost like a mouse , # PM: we have to come up with is the actual shape that people can ins instantly pick it up and know what it's going to do . # PM: so we we're looking at sliders for both a volume and channel change of one sort . # UI: I was thinking kind of just for the volume , # PM: Just for the volume , . # UI: but what do you guys think ? # ME: Dep I dunno if it # ME: depending on the final shape of it , 'cause you could have like , I dunno , it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb , and then you could control the buttons with your fingers . # ID: 'cause if in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling , # PM: it seems to me that it al also has the advantage that it the two are clearly different , # ID: just the way it would # PM: that there's no possibility of confusing the two . # PM: So okay . Right so # UI: I'm just gonna pass this along . # PM: is that all you want to say at the mo okay , fine . # ME: this is my report on trend watching . # ME: The data's come off internet from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer . # ME: And we got reports from Paris , Milan on new fashions . # ME: And the most important aspect is the l the look it has to look fancy , look and feel instead of the current functional look and feel . # ME: This is a st I was gonna say twice as important as the second aspect , which is the technologically innov innovative side of it . # ME: and the third being easy to use is probably a given , we have to try and incorporate , # PM: Well I mean I think that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those . # ME: I s that out of sequence ? # ME: from the fashion watchers from Milan and Paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes , et cetera . # ME: clothes , shoes and furniture and a spongy material to be used on the on the outside . # PM: I hadn't thought of that , that's different , certainly . # ME: But I was gonna say fruit and vegetables , important to this year important to furniture , I'm just gonna say f like it's in if fashion if we're going for the it looks fancy , then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through . # ME: But fashions do don't last very long . # ID: that can kinda tie into our changing face things , like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year and whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates , # ME: we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it and then we can just whip that off and # UI: like the kind you get on like hand weights . You know , that kind of spongy # ID: that weird I dunno what that is , # PM: Also means you can drop it without damaging it . # ID: , it's good as well . # ME: you have we could if we could save depending on the cost of the product itself , you know , could we have a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ? Instead of having a ten year guarantee ? # ME: With interchangeable covers , could just buy a new one every year , a new one when new fashions come out . # PM: I mean it its I that's an interesting idea , it's like the old Swatch watch where on only batteries ever got changed in those , 'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion , but it's just never been seen as a fashion item before . # PM: yes if they're made in sufficient quantity # ID: I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one , because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product . # PM: W I mean we can uh b but I mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last , you know , a long time . # PM: but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's even better . # UI: What if we included the batteries in the cover ? # ID: Oh . I like that . # ID: That all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers # UI: can I see that thing ? # UI: Just this as examples . # PM: I n I know the only p I mean the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it y you've then got the connection and you've immediately got a sort of unreliability , whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that the whole thing is all , you know , completely soldered together and it you know , total reliability , # UI: , I guess that's # PM: but I mean I d I know what you're saying and understand where you're coming from . # ME: Or well , but like more than just the battery , like a complete different like you've only got like , you know like th this bit's the bit you keep , and this is the expensive bit , this is like the chip and this is the microphone . # ME: And then this is the power source and the bit everyone sees . # PM: I think if we're gonna go down that route , then we're talking about even if it costs slightly more than that , just building the whole thing in one , then having getting cheaper production costs # ME: , you probably are right . # PM: and , you know giving people the option of buying a new a complete new thing , the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have a cover on at all , it will still work totally . # PM: then if , you know , if people lose the cover , I mean they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many Euros on a on a new one rather than a complete new re remote . # ID: that that's just it with the covers , you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product . # PM: I mean it is it's up to it's up to # UI: just another five Euro to get # PM: it's up to our marketing people to ma to ma turn it into a fashion item . # PM: and , you know , as external fashions change , then we get new covers on the market and , you know , readily available . # ID: And that's the sort of thing , once you get the mould set , you can just whip out different colours , different pictures very quickly . # UI: like they have for mobile phones # ID: , exactly , exactly . # UI: that are just fruits and animal prints and colours . # PM: So i so okay . right , we hadn't finished your # ME: oh , don't worry it's all said , I was just gonna say are we gonna make this as part of like a part of the f like it the fashions apply to furniture , so are we gonna make this part of the furniture ? # PM: It's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their coffee table to say this says something about me . # PM: this is fashionable . # ME: This is fashionable # PM: I , you know , I'm with it , I'm up to date . # PM: And you know , th the design that I've got , and it could be a home-made design , you know this says this is not just a television remote control , this is , you know , a fashion accessory . , so I mean the basic shape i is what we I mean given that we've got you know one on off button presumably , two buttons for channel change and one slider and basically nothing else , w we need to decide on the just the basic shape of the thing . # PM: And , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route , and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana , but know sort of the organic , you know , curved look , you know , t to deliberately get away from the you know , the square look of most current remotes and , you know , whether the you know , the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow . # PM: 'cause there's certainly you know , the corporate logo needs to be prominently displayed so that people s th looked at it and say right , that's a Real Reaction remote control , I want one of those . # ID: I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow I kinda thought with a you'd have like a yellow circle with the R_R_ in it somewhere on it , # ID: yellow seems a bit of a strong colour # ID: to make the ent like the thing but I mean just like white or grey or black or some sort of blah colour . # PM: I d I agree , I mean we're simply it's simply required to incorporate the corporate logo prominently . # ME: And make that a fashion symbol as well . # PM: th this is this is the whole point , you know , I've got a Real Reaction remote control to go with my Real Reaction coffee maker or whatever . # PM: And then people , you know , people demand more Real Reaction stuff . # UI: I was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe a shape that's almost like a mouse . # UI: So that , you know , when they hold it it's because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand maybe we could make it a slightly different shape so they could hold on to it , but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and have the power , wherever , somewhere . # UI: I mean that was just an idea that I had . # PM: there's the sim my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape so that you can just sort of ho hold it . # ID: you'd want it narrower than a mouse though # ID: 'cause it a mouse you're kinda just resting on it , you want something you can definitely grip . # PM: I mean well it's sort of it's sort of a mouse , # ID: So maybe it'd be # UI: Sort of a combination . # PM: but held , you know , so it's you sorta hold it in your hand like that , i with , you know , and fiddling with the buttons . # ID: and fiddle around with it and press it . # UI: kind of maybe a little wider than this , 'cause this is pretty comfortable to hold , and then if you had # ID: Maybe almost like a hairbrush , like you could get the about the width of that end of the pen and then it widens up top and you can fiddle # UI: then wider up here . # UI: And then it would have a l wider thing to have the light , the infrared light at the T_V_ and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume and the power could be wherever , up the top or something . # UI: What do you guys think about that ? # ME: that sounds I'm just I'm suddenly realising that we're discussing how much how good it's gonna be to change channels we still can just tell it to . # ME: I mean are we are we starting to get away from the voice functionality of it ? # PM: It's a very good point . # UI: It is a very good point . # PM: I think we d I think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes . # PM: That the we n we need the manual controls and that they should be of that form , but that . # ID: But do you know , this shape also kind of les lend itself to voice 'cause if you're holding it and you're fiddling , but you can also bring it up like that # PM: Then you just bring it up to your mouth and just speak to it , # ID: and it's microphone-esque , # ME: maybe we cou we're leaving out the buttons for the f less frequently used stuff , but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice . # PM: I th I th honest my personal view is that if it's not there , people wouldn't use it anyway . # ME: Mm I suppose , but t there is the off chance that , you know , th the brightness is wrong on your T_V_ or the contrast needs changing . # PM: It's cer it's certainly possible I mean , but they we we're going beyond w given the state of the technology we want something that we kno we know will work . # ID: you can still i incorporate the voice with less buttons . # ID: if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and or do voice commands , and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness and sc # ME: that's a good idea . # ID: and then you can you can minimise the buttons # UI: I suppose I sup # ID: and still have those , you know , brightness and tint and stuff . # PM: If we we're I'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available . # UI: So I guess we could have a menu button as well . # UI: We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume . # UI: So have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume . # PM: if we if we're going down that route , then we need some sort of display . # PM: Do we need some sort of display ? # ID: But the television would be the display # PM: We actually use the television , okay . Okay , okay , okay . # UI: , that's on the T_V_ , . # ID: things like that usually c pop up on a televi like you hit menu # ID: and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness , and you'd use the scroll , scroll through it . # ME: Well I mean onto like a mouse , the ru the scrolling button , is actually a button as well , you could press it , you could press that and have it as a menu button . # ID: I never understood how that worked though , # UI: that might work . # UI: it's like it's like the mouse where you just kinda click it . You just press it . # UI: and you could just click that to so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select . # UI: You know what I mean ? # PM: we got five minutes to go in this meeting , I think we've actually very conveniently just come to a good point to s to sum up . # PM: Kate and Kendra now go away and pa play with a bit of Plasticine or play-dough , # ID: Play with play-dough . # PM: whatever it is on the other side of the Atlantic . # PM: and actually put what we've discussed into something I was gonna say concrete , but that's a slightly inappropriate word to something that we can we can see and Andrew n can go away and th think about how we can actually market this as a concept and not j not just a simple remote control . # ME: can I just get some things clear just for my sake . # PM: , certainly , of course . # ME: Our energy source is gonna be # PM: I think I think we decided that we're gonna for # PM: for simplicity of , you know , manufacturing and maintenance that we will go for a long term battery source , you know , on the basis that , you know , if we're going for making it a fashion statement , then people are more likely to change it anyway before i it runs out and make an assumption that we can aim for a battery that will last most people for we'll say at least five ten years and that we'll w we will guarantee it for five years . # ME: And we're having a custom chip ? # PM: We're having a custom chip , but given the we've cut the functions down , that will hopefully not be too problematic , but given that technol technological innovation is important , then we need to , I'll say it again , technologically innovate . # PM: we , know , we must resist any efforts to try and water that down . # ME: And interchangeable case ? # PM: I i interchangeable case seems to be important to the concept . # PM: it should be cheap , you know , if we avoid any , you know , electrical connections . # PM: And i you know , i if we can come up with some way of allowing people to actually personalise it to whatever they want , then I mean uh this is totally new . # PM: We d we don't know whether that to what extent people do it or not , but if they've at least got a good selection of covers that they can use anyway , and if we can keep them , you know , rolling , you know , so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to a any of the famous supermarkets , I won't mention any mention any names , it's good for the supermarket and it's good for us and it hopefully makes them feel better . # ME: And are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or # PM: the that I mean that's because we've got so few buttons that it that actually makes that redundant . # ID: Mm , does actually , . # UI: , I think so too . # UI: especially for making them so like different and # ID: Mm different to feel , # PM: And the you know , that solves one of the problems of b of battery life , 'cause that would well that would clobber the battery life , I mean given the nature of the buttons we're having , it's actually uh unnecessary I think . # ME: Are we having it that it's any angle , or is it just # PM: As as wide cer certainly wider angle than current , # ME: As wide as possible . # PM: so that if you're holding it , you know , anyway like you're likely to and it's you know , i it will work most of the time . # UI: Like this or like this . # PM: Not like my mum who points it at the ceiling and wonders why the th the television doesn't work . # PM: I sorta envisaged that if this was the thing , then sort of the whole of the top would be the infrared . # UI: kinda like this whole So you could use like this and it would go . # PM: 'cause I mean the r reality is people are they're gonna be looking at the television whilst they're using it , the chances are , so if they're holding it anyway , the they're reasonably likely to be holding it to use it , then that that's the sort of coverage that we want . # PM: we're all clear where we go from here . # PM: Okay , so thank you very much indeed and I'll s see you all again in thirty minutes .
# PM: Welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and it looks like we've done a good job here and we'll just go through the final the final details . # PM: the th the minutes of the last meeting I think we'll take those as read , the th the next thing we we'll have a look at the th have a look at the prototypes and look at the evaluation criteria and finance and then uh just tidy up with production and then we can close . # PM: So f if you'd like to present your proposals . # ID: we basically have the same kinda lay-out here it's just you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically . # ID: on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and push . # ID: this is the power key , it's kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on . # ID: that's the little menu key . # ID: This is the infra-red section so you g it'll be sending rays and if you're you know pointing it like that it can send it , or if you hold it up like that it'll send it . # ID: we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can you know talk to it like that and it'll still understand . # ID: the logo is down there and has the cover on it and you can see like it just kinda goes the red bit's the cover and it kinda goes over everything and then there's holes for the buttons to come through . # UI: And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic , just kind of a light non-descript grey # UI: so that people'll wanna buy the covers and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers , # PM: showing me age , # UI: so they kinda just stretch over . # PM: I don't know what i c iPod covers are like . # UI: I didn't know that but they're kind of it's just kind of a rubbery and that way you know spongy like is something that people wanted and it just sort of stretches over and that way I think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well # ID: But it's also e easier to put on versus like mobile covers you actually have to screw them on and stuff and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you . # ID: This is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself # UI: just kinda stretch it over # ID: and it'll be fine . # UI: and it'll just stay on and then the buttons come through and so and then the each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the R_R_ . # ID: that'll be the covers as well , yeah . # PM: I mean tha it's a detailed point , I just wondered I mean h how will people put these down I wonder ? # PM: for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically # ID: it could stand , . # ID: we could broaden the broaden it out a bit so it would stand like that . # PM: because particularly if they've dif if they're gonna have it as a you know as a fashion item # PM: I mean it it's it it's just I mean it's just a minor detailed point , but as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger # ID: we could just widen it out # PM: and it just needs another logo somewhere is all it gives people the option and if say if they've got them because actually have several upon the # ME: Could have one for your stereo , one for your D_V_ player . # ID: Have to if we just lengthen it I guess so it comes down to the base of the hand # PM: that that's but # ID: and then flatten it out and could sit there . # PM: the overall the overall concept is # UI: Or just make it little . # UI: Somewhere like that # PM: I mean that's these # UI: so it just sort of # ID: We might have to lengthen it # ME: I kinda had a kinda a natural kind of a idea # ID: so it kinda your hand still holds it and have it there , like that , like that . # ME: where it's like more of a kind of like a kinda maybe slightly like thinner , kinda like that kinda like a flower or a plant # PM: But but no th but the # ME: for the more natural kinda # ID: The final product would actually stand up , . # PM: I mean it it's wouldn't # PM: wouldn't do that , indeed . # PM: But th but th b the these were all minor details , I think the basic concept i is absolutely bang on # UI: 'S a little longer . # PM: and the i it certainly meets our criteria of being of you know looking different . # PM: good that's that that's excellent . # PM: What's on the next one ? # PM: Oh right yes , let's have a look at the f finance . # PM: we're given a clear design brief , if I get the spreadsheet up . # ME: just click there . # ME: the maximise button . # PM: this is why we need to make these things simple so that the boss can understand . # PM: this is the company's uh costing for various uh aspects of design and I I've treated some of these slightly liberally given the constraints placed on us , I wouldn't know for in for instance if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not a special colour , that's a that's a standard colour . # PM: we're just simply on batteries , the one th the one decision I've had to make is that we're we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to do this with and I I'm certain that they are around that I don't think is a serious problem . # PM: The the voice sensor is expensive but we made a basic decision that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that has to stay . # PM: then again the shape of the case means that it's expensive to l to make 'cause of the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept we should exceed the sales targets . # PM: it's simply made of plastic so th that's no problem just because the whole the colour of the whole thing that's uh there's some cost there . # PM: we haven't actually got a scroll wheel we got push buttons and a simple slider and the and the buttons are uh well I do don't know that they're special colour . # PM: Anyway the costings come in at exactly on target at twelve point five but I thi I think we have a very strong case to argue that what we've got is so in innovative and different that any slight compromise we have to make on cost is offset by the you know the you know the concept of it being a fashion accessory and having the interchangeable covers so you know the if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative that they have to accept that we can't operate absolutely within the constraints that they give , we present this as the company's the company's way forward I think we can argue that we have come in on budget . # PM: Does anybody want to Andrew do you want what do you want to say about the evaluation # PM: where you know well where we're where we're at ? # ME: The the product or the project ? # PM: The the well the I meant the product . # ME: , well my presentation just now ? # PM: Mm . More loud clicks in the microphone . # ME: There we go , oh . # ME: Method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve , from the point of view of the consumer and the management . # ME: what I've been asked to do is , on the whiteboard gauge our team response to these questions . # ME: on a scale of one to seven , one being true and seven being false . # PM: Seven being a nice round number to work to . # ME: And then at the end just take an average # PM: On for true and seven for flase . # ME: look at these questions . # ME: Is the device f flashy and fashionable ? # PM: I think most definitely . # ID: I'd say definitely a one . # ME: and also technologically innovative ? # PM: the voice technology indeed . # PM: I don't see we could've made it any easier . # ME: suitable for the consumer ? # UI: I think it made we met all of the consumer # ME: is it complicated ? # ME: Doing pretty well so far aren't we ? # PM: found easily . # ME: We've b built in the speech , where are you , function . # PM: I mean that's Does it take long to learn to use ? # ME: The R_S_I_ compares to the current standards , # PM: Less buttons so it must be . # ME: it was our it was a # ID: it is sorta the handle more ergonomically correct as well . # ME: we made an actual effort to will device appeal to all age groups ? # PM: I think it will because I mean old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like the voice bit so # ME: that's a good call , we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality , the e ease of use of the device might make up for that . # PM: And it's I don't think we're actually charging a particular premium anyway , in the end , so # ID: I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups just 'cause we have gone with the fashion focus and the younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it , but I think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody , . # PM: It will appeal f for dif for different reasons but it's # UI: I think just the simplicity of it not having to learn to programme and not having you know a million buttons . # PM: I think we can reasonably say it's another one , why not ? # ME: can you just click the my mouse to move onto next page ? # ME: and what h did we make the management's # PM: in my interpretation of management's instructions is that yes it meets the requirement is t it's television only , it's simple to use , it's within budget , # UI: Under the cost . # PM: I it's yes an any minor points we argue . # PM: I think we've done an amazing job # PM: coming up with what # ME: one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven . # ME: Eleven divided by eleven's one so equals average of one . # PM: Need a need a calculator for that . # ME: And that roughly concludes my evaluation of the of the product . # PM: nick the cable back then . # UI: I mixed up the colours a little bit . # UI: I think I all wrong . # PM: either of you want to say anything ? # UI: I don't think so , I think we worked well together and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make and you know , seemed to discuss things pretty well and come to group consensus # PM: that's right , th this slide here I mean the satisfaction with room for creativity , # ID: Mm . , definitely . # PM: I think we've allowed ourselves as much creativity as the product allows . # PM: I won't comment on leadership , teamwork I think we've I think everybody's worked pretty well together . # PM: we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens , I think the results speak for itself and new ideas found , again gi no given relatively everyday product , I think we've v very effectively come up with a new a new approach . # PM: are the costs within budget ? # PM: Is the project evaluated ? # PM: We're we're all happy that it meets all the criteria , Thank you very much indeed , I think that I think that's # ID: Cool , thank you , # PM: I think we can go f for an early bath . # PM: So I call the meeting closed . # PM: Not sure how far ahead of schedule we were there .
# PM: it's not liking us , it went that-a-way . # PM: Computer adjusting . # PM: Okay . So . Right . # PM: You ready back there ? # PM: Welcome everyone . # PM: this is the kick-off meeting for the day . # PM: we're the new group to create a new remote control for Real Reaction . # PM: As you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting , become acquainted with each other , have a little training on tools , create a plan , discuss things and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total . # PM: The new remote control is to be original , trendy and user-friendly . # PM: That , Steph , is your part , is the user-friendliness . # PM: The originality is gonna take all of us . # PM: the trendiness we'll probably go look at for some marketing research information from you , Sarah . # PM: and we'll get on with it . # PM: Okay , so we'll have a functional design individual work with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design . # PM: Everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard . # PM: Kate , why don't you try it first , if you can either bring your things with you , I guess # ID: , if I can pick up with all these bits and pieces , hang on . # PM: And while you're doing that we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well , 'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around . # ID: right , so you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal . # ID: Do you have to be able to recognise what animal it is ? # PM: I do not think so , # UI: Are we all gonna draw a cat ? # PM: I think it's just to try out the whiteboard . # ID: Only animal I could thin I could draw . # ID: Its a sort of bunny rabbit cat . # ID: You can tell it's not a bunny rabbit by the ears . # ID: I suppose it should have a mouth as well , sort of # PM: And the characteristics ? # ID: the favourite characteristics of the cat the whiskers I think , because they're the easiest to draw . # ID: In fact , I'll give it some more and the tail # PM: Since you're handy as well , why don't you do yours next , Steph . # PM: I think it's to get us used to using the pen . # ID: sure it's not to test our artistic # UI: That's not a mouse-y , no . # ID: No it's not a mouse . # PM: Not a mouse , a rat . # ID: A webbed foot . # UI: It's clothes . That's it's clothes . # UI: It's a ratty with a with a with a very long tail . # PM: And your favourite characteristics of that animal . # UI: I love whiskers . # UI: they're intelligent and they're cheeky and fantastic pets and very friendly . # UI: And they sit on your shoulder and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you're doing your homework . # ID: why didn't I think of fish ? # ID: That's even easier to draw than cat . # ME: Mm this is very representational fish . # ME: I like them because they're sleek # PM: Favourite characteristics ? # ME: and they have a lot of freedom but they also do n swim in groups , # PM: they have team elements . # ME: Do you have a favourite one ? # PM: I'm afraid I'm with Steph . # PM: And I think your pen's running out of whatever . # PM: But I'm afraid I take the coward's way out , and the cat's looking the other way . # PM: cats are sometimes very independent . # PM: My parents had cats . # PM: and they can mm decide for themselves what is best . # PM: Okay . Now we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold we're to sell it for twenty five Euros , with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros . # PM: That tells you something about how many we have to sell on an international scale . # PM: would be an awful lot of these , would be like what , a hundred million of them to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million . # PM: the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item . # PM: if they cost twelve and a half , you're selling it for twenty five , you're making twelve and a half Euros each . # PM: and we're to make a profit of fifty million , that's t can you do the maths and how many are we selling ? # ME: I was just wondering if that's the If fifty percent is normal # ME: I would think would be more like sixty percent . # ME: But let me I have two thoughts . # ME: One hundred , fifty percent . # ME: And and your question is how many do we have to sell ? # PM: 'cause our market is international and your problem is has to do with marketing of you know , you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that . # ME: At twenty five . # PM: To give you a pretty good idea of where you're looking . # ME: that's four million of them ? # PM: Something like that ? # PM: That's fifty million Euros . # PM: In order to make fifty million Euros , and you're only getting twelve and a half each # ME: And if we make # PM: That's a lot of selling . # ME: Four million . # PM: To be fifty , be four million . You'd have to sell four million . # PM: Experience with a remote control . # PM: Any of you use of remote control for a television or D_V_D_ or something ? # PM: You're both nodding , # ID: That that that's the sorta product we're talking about , one that will work for a in a home environment , for a T_V_s and # PM: I've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time , but I also have heard about them not working well or not well co-ordinated and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another . # UI: It is true that you always sit around you know , you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something , there's five different remotes , and one for the D_V_D_ and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else . # PM: And they don't always talk to each other . # UI: But I presume this is t I presume this is just for television . # PM: Are there any ideas for the remote ? # PM: What would it be for and what group would be for ? # PM: We have to think about that one . # ME: We could make a Hello Kitty themed remote . # UI: I think one in b bright colours would be good . # ID: I think one that works would be good . # ME: We could totally go for the Japan-a-mation . # ME: I mean there's also the cachet that the Japanese make great products . # ME: Electrical their industrial design is very good . # UI: I think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions . # UI: Like I've got one at home that has well , apart from the obvious , channels , channel up , channel down , volume , you know , subtitles , mute , there's a lotta buttons that I've got no idea what they do , like . # ME: that's a really good point , because I think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate , we tend to go to menus and then make choices , you know , so if it's like an volume button , you know , you can go in and say mute or volume . # ME: We don't need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh channel up channel down . # ME: Mm . We can make it smart like an iPod , you know , make everything menus . # UI: closing the meeting . # PM: I know this sounds like it was very quick , # UI: That was quick . # PM: but the I think that's the industrial design is the first one , that's Kate , for the working design . # PM: And user , that's you S Steph , for the technical functions design , and for marketing the user requirements specification . # PM: I think there's going to be a lot of we have to help each other and work through this as a group , and I think we all , you know , we like our kitty-cat and our rat and our fish , but I think we all have to like each other to get this done . # PM: as it says , we're gonna get individual instructions , but I don't think they allowed a lot of extra time , so I think a little bit of less of this and more at do will set us in good stead . # PM: Do you all agree ? # PM: then I don't see any reason to prolong it and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now and go into other things . # PM: Alright , so this is the end of the first meeting . # PM: Thank you all .
# PM: One , two , three , four , we're ready . # PM: Welcome to this second meeting . # PM: it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes for this meeting . # PM: This is a meeting on functional design . # PM: and I wanna welcome you all and thank you all for doing some research in between . # PM: I did took the minutes from the first meeting and I'll show them to you in a moment . # PM: I know each of you have a presentation and in thinking about the forty minutes , I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion , because there's I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some decision on what functions it will have . # PM: Is this ap everybody agree with this ? # PM: and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions . # PM: but now for the minutes of the first meeting . # PM: And go to that one . # PM: as you can see it was this earlier today . # PM: Kate , Steph , Sarah and myself in our four capacities were present . # PM: I opened the meeting , the product was developed and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it . # PM: and it had some implications , the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese . # PM: And we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting Anybody have any questions on those minutes ? # PM: Are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ? # PM: Did I miss something ? # ID: we talked about the individual roles that we each had as well . # PM: I'm afraid I incorporated that when I said who was present , but yes , we did , and we did a little bit of team building of making the pictures , # ME: Okay , I accept the minutes . # PM: but I didn't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily . # PM: as a group I think we've are they're accepting the minutes . # ME: Is that what we're supposed to say ? # PM: , then we'll move to the three presentations . # PM: Mm we need to move this . # PM: Who wants to go f first ? # PM: That's as far as it goes . # UI: not really meant to touch those microphones . # UI: Oh it doesn't have any on , does it ? # ME: Excellent , thank you . # ID: big loop under the table . # PM: She said we didn't need to screw it in . # ME: Okay , that looks good . # PM: It's doing its thing . # ME: Thank you very much . # ME: One of the biggest issues I found about from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these remote controls and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . # ME: my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools . # ME: some of the research in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and that means we do need to make some decisions about what keys or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and what ones to discard . # ME: And if we devote some energy into this , I think the recent productions of Real Reaction , the I go everywhere power and the high definition D_V_D_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these , I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . # ME: And in fact I think the high definition D_V_D_ players and all of this will come along in the will only benefit from the positive feedback from our well designed tool . # ME: again , most users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . # ME: fifty percent I think of all these numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . # ME: And eighty percent of users , and if we think about this there are a lot of television , D_V_D_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy . # ID: Could can I ask where these figures come from , is this market research we've # ME: it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room , so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money . # PM: in between , as the Project Manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be that teletext is outdated and the internet is coming in as important , but that they want this remote control to only be for T_V_ with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan . # ME: I think we can I think we can really focus on this remote and again bring the Real Reaction brand in and get some positive marketing for our other tools , even if we directly don't advertise for the I go everywhere line . # ME: an interesting element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question . # ME: these market research uh questionnaires looked into your concern about technology and s specifically wanted to find out information about speech recognition . # ME: the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and luck lucky for us have the cash to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . # ME: Very interesting , I leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this if and you know , the designers , but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five # PM: Is that a large enough target market to target it ? # ME: I think especially in terms of growth , I think this would be a very smart group to target . # ME: I mean s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , and with the technologies improving , if we can get these # PM: In real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ? # PM: Or eight million . # ME: But would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and did I know that it was it was an that's a that's a very good question . # ME: I don't know if speech recognition should be should be included , but I think it's an interesting I think that maybe shows more about being open to technology . # UI: it definitely needs a lot more research # ME: Shall I go back ? # UI: on like how much more it would be and any , you know , existing examples , and what reactions to them have been , and that sort of thing . # ID: How d I'm wondering how ou how our target price compares with the typical price of these things . # ID: I expect an Industrial Designer should know that , but if we're aiming to build this thing for twelve Euros fifty , is that a lot or a little ? # ME: I did not receive any information on that , but I think the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very important , because there is a question about do you want an L_C_D_ screen and that wasn't responded to , but some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate , you know , so it turns into something perhaps you all have seen the Osbournes where Ozzy Osbourne is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a small tray . # ID: Sh surely he's in the wrong age group . # ME: You know , it's I a and I think , you know # ID: He must be w one of a s small population . # ME: Kate , you're exactly right there . # ME: But I think the key is to get the early adopters , people who are familiar with technology and they'll be # PM: But we're not looking at whether they're early adopters on that screen , that's looking at age groups . # ME: Exactly . I yes , and I'm making and I'm making the uh leap that people who are familiar younger people are l are more familiar with technology than older people . Or comfortable , you know , so # PM: you had the other power channel . # ME: I think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist , power , channel , volume and everything else is up to the designers . # ME: And this is this is also supported by the market research . # ME: That's my contribution . # PM: And we'll turn to the next presentation . # PM: I think she said we don't need to screw it in , just stick it in . # PM: And then press , what ? # PM: F F_N_ and F_ eight . # PM: Next to the control button on the bottom , and then F_ eight at the top . # PM: And then w be patient . # ID: And if you want it to go into slide show mode , it's that little button there . # UI: Can I not just do each one in order ? # ID: I you can if you like , it that just sets it up to do a p a p # PM: There we are . Yay . # ID: that one , that one there . # ID: Left , left a bit , left a bit , that one , yep . # UI: technical functions design . # UI: I think first off , basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as your personal preferences,yeah . I think we need a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions . # UI: my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have . # UI: And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . If we can build on this with the speech recognition , that's not something I'd thought about at all , but it's also something we can discuss . # UI: and I presume we can miss out the functions really to a video or D_V_D_ remote control , if this is only gonna be a , you know , satellite , cable , T_V_ remote control . # UI: these are two models of existing remote controls . # UI: the one on the left seems to be a fairly standard universal remote control . # UI: It has fast-forward , stop , play , all relating to movies . # UI: It also has seems to have channel up and channel down , which is which is more what you'd expect from a , you know , like a Sky or cable remote control where you've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one . # UI: but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , which has it also has play , stop and pause and everything , I don't think we need them at all . # UI: I think we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down and I think an enter function where you can access it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen . # UI: not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do . # PM: And exceed the requirements they're expecting of us . # UI: really exceed the requirements , 'cause the requirements really are just want to be able to change channels and functions , which is more a text on the screen thing than actual buttons I was thinking something some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and a menu that you can access . # UI: but then I do think we need to discuss the speech recognition possibility . # PM: Any thing else you wanna add ? # UI: But we could go back to the pictures of the , what're they called ? The pictures of the remote controls and possibly discuss what we think about them , but maybe should hear what Kate has to say first . # PM: Let's hear what Kate has to say . # ME: Maybe afterwards we could do a whiteboard with that your the one on the right as a as a basis . # ME: Whiteboard session . # PM: I think the white that one on the right is , as well as less cluttered , # UI: Definitely less cluttered and I mean but still it's # PM: It's there but it's # UI: I was just I'll just resume something else I was gonna say . # UI: The the style of these is terrible . # UI: I really think we need to not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand-held device , colours , just every e , everything to do with this has to be revolutionised . # ME: The ergonomics , the way it fits in your # UI: that's that for now . # ID: Mm , I haven't actually got a display on my screen . # ID: Still , I'll do without that . # ID: Okay , now I wanna bring us down to earth again I'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work . # ID: and this is the methodology I used in preparing for this meeting . # ID: basically I've been doing a little bit of web-based research , and if I had a design team , I would've been discussing my ideas with 'em . # ID: But the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design that I'd like to discuss with you . # ID: let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is . # ID: It's for sending a message , typically via infrared . # ID: And the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are an energy source , the user interface which will in incorporate an integrated circuit that actually composes the message based on what the which buttons the user presses , we turn that into a message , and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . # ID: I would have hoped I think that's my only slide actually , I would have hoped to do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of my first cut design , but unfortunately the technology defeated me , so if you'll bear with me I'll do it on the whiteboard . # ID: we want an energy source which is there . # ID: And we've got to think about what that might be . # ID: we obviously don't want wires on this thing . # ID: typically it would be a battery , but I'm open to suggestions . # ID: then we have the user interface . # ID: And the main components in there are the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message , which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , which encodes it and sends the message to the receiver . # ID: those are the basic things that we've got to get in for our twelve Euros fifty . # PM: But those things as long as we can get those components , the block , that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in what does it look like ? # PM: What do the buttons look like ? # PM: what does it feel like ? # PM: That's where the user interface is really coming into its own . # PM: The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there , but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong . For example the battery energy source or what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ? # PM: is there any because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for D_V_D_s , movies , whatever . # PM: does it have to have a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ? # ID: I may be wrong here , but I'd been thinking of this device as being a cheap mass-produced device . # ID: We're trying to sell four million of 'em , that's , you know , that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is . # ID: and I hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing , you just if it goes wrong you chuck it out , and that's why I'm a bit concerned . # ID: I like the idea of speech recognition , that's a great idea , but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need gonna need to hit . # ME: Do we have ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ? # UI: Isn't that your job ? # ME: Because then # ME: the chip composer marketing . # ME: the chip composer sender . # PM: Mm . What they cost . # ID: I'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna give me some advice on that , if you're asking me , # ME: I don't believe I know , . # ME: Be because then we would ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea . # UI: It does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced , which is pretty much the same as these existing models , just maybe a little bit more inspired , # UI: but basically just the same . # UI: Although what suddenly came into my head is , you know how they always take two A_A_ batteries which is really not very efficient at all . # UI: Could it be possible to have , you know , like a rechargeable internal battery , like , well , like an M_P_ three player does ? With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever . # UI: You could you know , you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours , and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages , and you don't have to worry with replacing A_A_ batteries , which are # ME: that has another element , which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger , then you then it has a place . # UI: You'd never need batteries would y # ME: but it also has a place , # UI: And it's not stuck down the back of the sofa . # UI: But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not . # ME: That's a really good idea . # ID: I think that's a very interesting idea , but I'm not a very good industrial designer and I don't know much about what these things cost . # ID: I'll do some research for the next meeting . # ME: it's better than my idea about solar , probably . # ID: solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night , # UI: it is just so annoying how # PM: It would have to sor store up the energy # PM: and then use it . # PM: Solar can do that . # ID: We may be talking quite heavy then . # PM: M , that would be too heavy and it'd cost too much . # UI: but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably I mean it might cost more to at first to develop and to install , but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer # ID: do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ? # ME: Definitely , 'cause I'm thinking in terms of the loss and breakage of remotes , how much of that is to do with it not really having a home , a nest , a place to live , # UI: Sort of have its little dock that you could put it in . # ME: So if you can dock it , you know , you could s argue that this is # PM: And the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent . # UI: Still I don't know if it's quite within our price range . # ME: 'Cause you are talking about another component , like another piece of hardware . # PM: Are we agreed as to what our target group is though ? # PM: Pretty much , so that we'd be looking for the younger end . # ME: I brought up some exactly , but I think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there , or are they making purchasing decisions ? # ID: I was wondering that , # ME: these are the # ID: because I ag I agree that there there're people with how can I put it , more money than sense and who are liable to buy something new , # PM: I s usually put more money than brains . # ID: Bu but what I was gonna say was , although they may be buying , you know , personal music devices and all that , # ME: Oh oh I'll make a note of that , Kate . # ME: Good , good comment . # ID: are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls ? # ID: Because they probably live in a household that has a T_V_ if they're at the lower end of the age range , I don't know . # ME: It might be good to know who , you know , who's actually buying televisions and are we in a uh s region where people have more than one television in a home ? # ID: Mm . I think we've got a big hill to climb here , haven't we ? # ID: I mean we've gotta persuade people who've got a remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead . # PM: Or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ? # PM: We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it . # ID: Right , good point . , okay , . # UI: That's probably more what it is . # PM: What would be a more efficient way of doing it ? # ME: and some of our D_V_D_ players incidentally have them , because we have the relationship with our own department , but moreover we need to go for the manufacturers . # UI: We're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day , # PM: Probably not . # PM: the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions . # PM: Our functions , we've so far decided , I think , that power , channel , volume make it attractive . # PM: it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys . # PM: It has to have big user-friendly buttons and sh n definitely we wanna be inspired that the current styles are just plain awful . # ME: Do we need let me # PM: Is that agreeable to everyone ? # ME: Br actually , the enter key I have a chart here that I didn't include . # ID: Do you want the gizmo ? # PM: Throw some light on that . # ME: th those are felt like had a lot of charts . # PM: actually we're , you know , we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes , so we have to get close to finishing . # ME: my only comment is I think maybe we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining . # PM: Enter , power as a s oh a sum simultaneous key . # ME: Again , you know , # PM: Is that okay with you ? # ME: thinking of menus or # ID: H how does that work ? # UI: I was miles away . # ID: How so how does that work , # UI: I was re I was reading the chart to be honest . # ID: how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ? # ME: if you're pressing enter , the thing would already be on , and so maybe when you press power , initially it turns it on , press power again and use that as an enter # PM: Then you'd have to have an off te off key . # ME: so you press power after you've I was thinking maybe you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession , # ME: and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power , and then that would make that choice . # ID: It's not getting a bit complicated ? # ID: Could granny do this , or are we just not aiming at granny ? # ME: Or something that has a turning dial , where at the far end is on or off . # UI: Who's got an iPod then ? # ME: Anyway , that was the only comment about some of the decisions people have made , what's most important . # ME: It's definitely channel , volume , power . # UI: things like screen settings and audio settings , I would generally do them on the actual television itself , # UI: like here you have a you know , a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself . # UI: I wouldn't know how to do it using a remote control , so I would say that they are definitely less relevant . # ME: Thanks for looking at that . # PM: I guess easy to use is the other thing that we want 'em to be able to do . # PM: As you said , you know , don't make it too hard for the granny . # ME: We don't wanna outsmart # PM: I just joined that set last week . # PM: first grandchild arrived . # ME: Congratulations . # PM: so are we agreed then of those things ? # PM: And let's go back to agenda and hook me up . # PM: Mm . This oughta be fun . # PM: It probably won't go the first time , it'll probably be like a g mess . # PM: it lost it off here . # ME: you're fine . It's fine . # PM: it was up there , but I couldn't see it down here . # PM: Mm . This time it should be both . # ID: How do you do that ? How do you make it do both ? # PM: you have to keep doing the financi the F_N_ and F_ eight to five minutes to finish , # ID: it toggles through , # PM: thank you a lot for telling me . # ME: I think you have to cycle through . # PM: we're ready to close . # PM: will be completed q questionnaire , then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research and I'll put some minutes of this meeting together . # PM: your individual assignments are for Kate to do the components , for you , Steph , to do the user interface and for you the trend-watching . # PM: and each of us will get help from our coach . # PM: Are we agreed to get ourselves together and then have lunch ? # PM: Then that's the end of this meeting . # PM: And I hope that's good enough for her to tell her that's the end . # UI: We didn't come to any sort of decision on the functions though . # PM: I think I went over the functions and wrote them down and marked them . # UI: Alright , that's fine then . # PM: that's what I went over and nobody was objecting to them . # ME: and you'd mentioned I was just gonna say , could you reiterate the new project requirements , because it they were it has to be for a T_V_ , just to keep myself # PM: the teletext is outdated , # ID: we're still in meeting , aren't we ? # PM: the internet is important , # PM: it's only to be for a T_V_ and it must include the corporate image , colour and slogan which I think is more in the user range , with Steph . # UI: what actually are these is that the yellow and black ? # PM: It doesn't tell me . # UI: From their I'll just use it from their website .
# PM: Okay , carry on . # ID: Just just carry on . # PM: Alright this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . # PM: our agenda should be that we're opening the meeting , the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point . # PM: and we should each have a presentation to make . # PM: we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . # PM: It's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , which I'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us . # PM: there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we'll come back to them in a minute after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting . # PM: as we remember , I opened the meeting , the four of us were present , the meeting the first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved . # PM: Sarah , you presented a marketing research report which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition . # PM: And then Steph did a second presentation that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use . # PM: I think all of us agreed with those things . # PM: Kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half Pence cost . # PM: but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point . # PM: and the new requirements that it for be for T_V_ only and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the corporate design be included . the corporate image . # PM: we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . # PM: Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_ , but it still should meet those parameters . # PM: and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held . # PM: at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what do the current ones sell for . # PM: and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics . # PM: Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed . # PM: And I was to type up these minutes and work on the final report . # PM: Is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was ? # PM: Right . So we're ready to close that and go back to our That one . # PM: We're up to the point of the Go back . # PM: the three presentations . # PM: So we're going to pull the plug on me and turn to Sarah . # PM: Is that alright with everybody else ? # PM: Especially since Kate asked to be last . # PM: Sarah , I'm sorry if I misspelled your name , I didn't know whether it was S_A_R_A_ or S_A_R_H_ . # ME: I respond to either . # PM: You respond to whatever you get , huh ? # PM: , did you do your Hit there it is . # ME: first thing I want to address is one of the points that Florence brought up , which was current cost of the competition devices , similar to the ones that Stephanie showed us and they're twenty to sixty Euros , depending on branding . # ME: Some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end . # ME: But I think that with the current price that we're searching for , we're well within , even on the lower end , of the of the market . # ME: But I'm going to move on to more interesting more vibrant things . # ME: I investigated the remote control market in greater detail , and my the theme of what I was to work on was trend watch . # ID: I'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on . # ME: I know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research , so you know , I'm just gonna try to cloak it in really professional terms here . # ME: What's hot , fruit and veg . Spongy . # ME: And this is all over the catwalks , Paris , Milan , and I'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes . # ME: This is really interesting change from past years , because it is much more organic , some would say approachable . # ME: And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset . # ME: I also did a little research on what again are the most important priorities in decision making about purchasing . # ME: Functional is out . # ME: And f the fancy , and that's exactly the term , I'm thinking polished , elegant , you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above . # ME: This is twice as important as the next finding , which is technologically innovative . # ME: This is interesting , 'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important , but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with technologically superior fabrics or , you know , designed in interesting substances . # ME: Ease of use . Again , pretty low , I mean it's the top three , but each of the fancy and technologically innovative are far more important . # ME: I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit themed sleeves . # ID: I think that's a good idea . # PM: It sounds like the covers that they use for the remote , you know , your t your cell phone . # ME: Exactly . Exactly . # ME: I was thinking though that instead of having something like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress . you know , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy . # ME: They could be ini initially I thought we could start with kind of fruit that would suit kind of a long hand-held , so banana , pineapple and pear . # ME: it could actually the sleeve could take up a lot of the development and the remote control , we'd just need to get reductionist on it . # ME: They could be interchangeable , they're spongy , that goes back to ergonomic , and the youngsters love 'em , fun for the whole family , everyone can have their own . # ME: So what we're talking about is changing . this concept . # ME: Everyone has a T_V_ remote , but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit . # ME: That's what's hot on the catwalks . # ME: this is my This is what I'm thinking . # PM: In most families , don't isn't the remote is a remote . # ME: but I think I think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it we all need a remote , but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , I'm thinking the teenager , the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers . # UI: So when your dad's sitting there , overriding your decision , going no we're gonna watch this , you can bring out your own remote and be like zap , no we're gonna watch this . # ME: W and plus I think # PM: Mm . Well actually some households do have three and four T_V_s and they would have a remote for each one , # ME: this is an idea you know , this is exactly what the research has shown . # ME: So I really open this up to any other feedback . This spongy fruit and veg . # ID: I think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this . # ID: Spongy is gonna be difficult , I'm afraid . # UI: And as for as for well budgeting as well , if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable components . # ME: I just have my ear to the market , guys . # UI: Is this to the market ? # ID: , I mean basically we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber . # ID: I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy , # ME: Is spongiest , . # ME: That would add # ID: I was thinking titanium myself . # UI: I was thinking titanium , I was thinking it's just I have been influenced by pictures of iPods , and they're also minimalist and shiny . # ME: They are and they would fulfil the first priority , which is fancy . # ME: I think many of us would associate those with fancy . # ME: Something else we could do is call it something that's fruit and veg oriented . # ME: We could call it The name . # PM: Are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate product ? # ME: it would be a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . So # PM: Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management # UI: but it's kind of pointless , isn't it ? # PM: and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product . # ME: That , you know , that might be # UI: Let's delegate . # PM: Wo would that be agreeable ? # ME: And then we could keep it titanium . # ID: W w would it be helpful if I described the components a bit , because I think it would give you maybe bring this discussion back to Earth of what we can actually physically do . # PM: Do you wanna be next or you want Kate to go next ? # UI: I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next . # PM: we'll move the # UI: You can even have them in different flavours as well . # UI: So that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour , # ME: Or s or smelly . Scratchy # UI: Scratch and sniff . # ME: I was really thinking a lot about the I_ the iMac kind of gel gem tone . # ME: It's hot on the streets , guys . # ID: I think some of this you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you , but I'm afraid this is the real world . # ID: I've been looking at the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , and I've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , who have told me what's actually available , you know , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they've got , but I'm not sure that it's quite what you want this isn't a very good overhead , but this is just to show you , this is the innards of a remote control . # ID: I really need a pen or something does my mouse work ? # ID: can you see my little mouse pointer ? # ID: This is this is the a remote that's been opened up and that's the back of the interface . # ID: And this is a push-button one , so you see these little buttons here , they're little rubber buttons that go through onto the board at the back and they push these buttons here . # ID: that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate . # ID: We got to have something that pushes the little buttons that talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the message to the receiver . # ID: I wan I wanna go through not just addressing the points that you made , Sarah , but doing my presentation in the order I wrote it . # ID: So first of all I wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source . # ID: we can have your bog standard double A_ batteries in a replaceable little compartment . # ID: We can have a hand # ID: a wind-up , which I think is quite an interesting concept for a sorry for a remote control , but i it maybe is doesn't quite go with the fruit and veg . # ID: one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source , # PM: Remember , we only have forty minutes # ID: where you actually get the energy by moving the device , which is quite a ni a nice and neat one . # ID: You have to it means that if it's sitting there for a long time it probably won't work , but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then , it'll work . # ID: Or we had talked about solar power , but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark . # ID: I'm afraid this is the options we've got on the case . # ID: It can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like , or titanium . # ID: and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber , but I'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium , and basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface , but I think if we wanna use standard components , we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that . # ID: what does the interface look like ? # ID: push button , that's the one we're all familiar with . # ID: we can have scroll buttons and the scroll button can incorporate a push , so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that and push to select something . # ID: you can have multiple scroll buttons , this is maybe getting a little bit complicated , but it's it the technology is there . # ID: And we can also incorporate an L_C_D_ display in the remote , but this will increase the cost . # ID: the electronics that actually makes the device work , we've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced , and the price goes up as we choose each of this . # ID: If we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . # ID: All the other fancy interface designs go out the window , I'm afraid . # ID: pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . # ID: If you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more , but it that's what you need if you want the L_C_D_ display . # ID: And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed sample sensor sample speaker devices . # ID: I don't know what that is , but I think they think it's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere . # ID: ou our real expertise is in push buttons , I have to say , but maybe you think that's old technology . # ID: And well I think we've got two options . # ID: We can either go for a really cheap model , keep all of the costs down , which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons . # ID: Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , I think it , won't necessarily l look like a pineapple , but that may or may not be a good thing . # ID: but it could have an L_C_D_ screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons , and it could have the company's new development of the sample sensor and speaker . # ME: That sounds good . # ME: Any idea you mentioned that there would be a cost difference . # ME: do you have any idea if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty ? # ID: I'm afraid I don't have that information available . # ID: manufacturing didn't actually give attach any prices to any of this , I'm afraid . # ME: Because , you know what , I'm being quite serious when I say that the things I mentioned are hot . # ME: But I think the important thing might be to choose one . # ME: You know , if what you're telling me is some of these things aren't just f aren't feasible , maybe we could something about naming , we could call it , you know , Blackberry . # UI: Bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company , so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it . # ME: Alright , let's see then . # UI: I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company . # UI: It's just what I'd understood we'd be doing . # UI: That's before I heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit-wise . # ID: We we could we could do a double curved rubber one , # ME: I'm trying to streamline mine a little bit . # ID: which would allow say a banana , but unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface , we can't do anything fancier . # UI: Shall we wait 'til I've 'til I've showed you what well , my extensive presentation on what sort of interfaces are available . # ME: Thank you , Kate . # PM: Thank you , Kate . # UI: You did seem to include just in more detail what I've got though . # UI: So so mine's a bit pointless . # UI: F_N_ and F_ eight , did you say ? # UI: I don't have it on mine though . # ME: I think Florence resolved it by # ID: I If you do F_ F_N_ F_ eight again , it's it'll # ME: F_ eight again . # PM: Keep doing it until you get it in both you get it there , you get it yours without that one , # ID: I think it , you will do an # PM: and then you get it with both . # UI: Should I do it again ? # PM: This time it should come up both . # UI: I don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says , just that my method was to look at the , well , my inspirations , which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including M_P_ three players , like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things . # UI: having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece . # UI: I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel , I couldn't find a the picture of the iPod w only linked to a web browser , so I couldn't copy and paste it , but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . # UI: It has scroll wheels without a display , but they scroll like a computer mouse . # UI: So I was thinking that a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen . # UI: Like I guess an existing Sky or cable one does . # UI: Like , you know , you press enter and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment , and you can do you can scroll along and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour , and you scroll up and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen . # UI: but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote , which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , but still quite simple and quite cost effective . # UI: what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , not fancy but not totally minimalist , I mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , I was thinking , yellow and black , just because that's the company's colours , with very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the iPod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive . # UI: And when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you , you might as well have it appearing on the screen in front of you , it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching . # UI: And so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing Sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down . # ID: , I'd certainly support that idea . # UI: And and I definitely support the use of plastic and or rubber . # UI: I mean titanium would be great , but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey . # UI: If we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then I think titanium's too futuristic . # ID: It's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well , we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately . # UI: Whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else . # ID: And the having the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea , 'cause otherwise we're putting up the price not only for putting building the L_C_D_ in , but for the electronics as well . # UI: And it's a little bit pointless as well I think . # ID: There is that . # UI: when you've got when you've got the screen there , it doesn't have to be anything fancy , # ME: It's a duplication . # UI: just a little menu showing a menu , you go into one menu and then it can have your different options , whether you wanna change the settings or the you know , your information about programme that's on at the moment . # UI: I don't think that's to taxing to s engineer . # UI: But as for actually arranging them let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one . # UI: And I quite like it , 'cause it's just smooth and hand-held and it's got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely spaced out , so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle . Up , down , left , right . # ID: Do you want scroll buttons in that as well ? # UI: I was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll , but you know , a I can't quite d describe it . # UI: you see on the one on the right , down at the bottom , is the mouse . # UI: see where the mouse is , like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right . And enter in the middle , so you pick your menu and then your different options and when you click on each one , it you can go into a new menu for that . # UI: I'm getting a bit specific here . # UI: Really we'd have to use something to show you , # ID: I think I think that's a g nice clean design , it's playing to our strengths which are in push button technology . # UI: I don't think I can get it up on the screen . # UI: the iPod spinning wheel is really complicated . # UI: It does scroll , but it is hugely complicated . # UI: What else have we got ? # UI: Them , they're terrible . # UI: But they all have this feature of this It's not quite a scroll wheel , but it's a kind of selection in this circle , # PM: It's a selection wheel . # UI: which I think is a really good idea . # ID: But we can implement it with simple push buttons , which is much cheaper . # UI: like up , down , left and right . # UI: Which is good . # UI: And then and then , so I mean either a channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down , and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen , it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down . # UI: So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle . # UI: Look at look at this one . # ID: that's really nice . # UI: Almost impossible to misplace or l or lose . # ME: Do you think with # UI: Might take up your whole living room . # ME: It seems that you guys are quite keen on the plastic , perhaps the something reminiscent of the child's remote . # ME: Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ? And have it abstract . # ME: we could call like a fruit name , but it would be a little more abstract . # ID: Mm . We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy # UI: That also is possible . # ME: I'm just throwing out ideas . # PM: Or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow . # ME: I'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so # UI: just something else I need to bring to your attention is have you have you seen these on a remote ? # UI: This is actually the volume up and down , but they both say V_ on them , which , when you first look at it , you expect that to be the down , because it looks like a downward pointing arrow , but it's actually the V_ to indicate that it's the volume , so we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these . # ME: Nice . Good point . # UI: But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down . # UI: If we're having the scroll wheel , then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions . # UI: But then , that's complicated . # PM: I wanna thank you all for all your presentations . # PM: We have about ten minutes left , in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts . # PM: and I think you all have been self-stimulating of working together . # PM: we need to come up with some specifics of the components , the materials , things like making the decision on the energy and the case and the interface type things . # PM: They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use , which the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery , kinetic or solar . # PM: this is where Kate's expertise comes in , and our decision making will be a little bit guided by Kate at this point . # PM: You were saying that the kinetic would be useful , that is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or keep replacing the batteries . # PM: or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day , that it'll die on you , and no way to do it . # PM: That's the day you wanna use the T_V_ . # PM: so what's our pleasure here , what would be the cost consequences of each of the three ? # ID: unfortunately I don't have costing information . # ID: I i in terms of workability , I think the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic , but I'm sorry I don't figures on the difference in cost . # PM: What's the feelings of the group on the kinetic ? # ME: I've used kinetic in terms of watches and it's very handy , you don't even notice that it's there . # UI: It sounds great . # UI: I've never come across it before , but it sounds fantastic . # UI: Sounds like it could be g a really good economical it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient . # ME: It could tie in with the fanciful design , you know , # UI: 'Cause it's really a quite attractive thought , # ME: throw the banana , you know , just gotta keep it moving . # PM: So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible . # UI: a good selling point . # UI: But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs . # ID: And and how much you do have to keep it moving , 'cause I'm conscious that watching T_V_ can be quite a sed sedentary activity . # ME: But I could market that as a as a I was thinking actually a cost saver down the road , in terms of battery , you know . # UI: Do your exercises while you're watching the T_V_ . # ID: m more environmentally friendly . # UI: , that's what I was thinking as well . # ME: . You know , kind of the # PM: Thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish , thanks . # ID: Oh right , okay , # PM: the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision . # ID: that that's something I maybe should have covered . # ID: chip on print is just a manufacturing technique and I would certainly recommend it , I think , because I'm not sure I have an alternative . # PM: What about the ca # ID: I i it it's just the way that the th the way it's ac it's actually built # ID: and you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper . # PM: what about the case ? # PM: I think they're talking there about do we want wood , plastic , titanium or rubber , and I think we've discussed not having titanium . # PM: One , it's too expensive , and second , it won't do this double curves . # PM: we've sort of eliminated wood . # PM: We said plastic or rubber . # PM: What's the pleasure ? # ID: if Sarah's keen on a spongy feel , the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls , # ME: That's exactly what I was thinking . I'm sold . # PM: What about you ? # UI: Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy , s thick spongy cover , # ME: Kind of like an internal egg . # UI: so it feels like the whole thing's spongy , but actually you're not damaging anything by squeezing it . # PM: Plastic inside . # UI: Because I mean you could just get carried away with the with the tac # ID: I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible , but I agree , it's sounds like a nice idea if it is . # UI: you do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile , you just wanna stroke them and squeeze them , # ME: And with sports on television . # PM: the next part they want is the user interface concept . # ID: I should I should r # PM: I'm sorry to push you , but we only have a couple minutes to finish with . # ME: Then I'll just say I support either from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that . # PM: and it says interface . What type and what supplements ? # UI: Just copy the one on the left . # UI: a scroll like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen . # ID: Which I think technically is just push button and I'd certainly support that brings the cost down quite a lot # UI: I'd like push buttons with # ID: and it's something that we're an ex the company's an expert on . # UI: push buttons # PM: this is gonna sound weird , but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes . # PM: And they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , you can look and see this as well as I can . # PM: Marketing they want product evaluation . # UI: it's still it's still plugged in on mine actually . # ME: No we can't , actually . # PM: Oh my , I'm sorry . # ME: That's why I was looking over your shoulder # PM: Sorry about that . # PM: missed that one . # PM: This ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work . # UI: Now it's gone again . # ID: You know , I think the company's s next project should to design a better overhead device that switches immediately . # PM: because I can't even see mine . # PM: Next meeting starts in thirty minutes , these are the individual actions . # PM: the look and feel design is for Kate , Steph gets the user interface design , you get product evaluation . # PM: the two of you get to play with a Pla modelling clay to do a prototype . # PM: and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way . # PM: Anything else we need to do ? # UI: I don't think so . # PM: And that's the end of this meeting . # PM: That's for her benefit . # ME: That's really all I got , guys .
# PM: almost , there's one more thing I have to get out of the I have to make sure that this attachment will open . # ID: I keep forgetting whether I've done this . # PM: We'll open that when the time is right . # PM: In the meantime Closing things down , Let's see what this thing does . # PM: Does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ? # PM: we came up together , we're good . # PM: Are we ready to start ? # PM: It's now quarter of four . # PM: This is a f another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five . # PM: Our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , for us to go over the previous minutes , then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g Sarah present the evaluation criteria . # PM: We then have a finance aspect , which is a spreadsheet , an Excel spreadsheet . # PM: And I know what you're all thinking of , oh my , because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation . # PM: So we're going to make a very fast track . # PM: and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing . # PM: So the first thing I have to do is close this so that I can get to Where is it ? # PM: I need to open mine . Not the agenda . # ME: Agenda three . # PM: that th I want the minutes from the previous minutes . # PM: That should be there , minutes . # PM: from meeting three , is it alright with you if I don't switch it to show , just use it as is ? # PM: 'Cause this way I can more easily flip it . # PM: obviously all of us were here for the last meeting , we reviewed the previous minutes before that , each of you made your presentations . # PM: we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . # PM: The market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . # PM: we decided chip on print would be used . # PM: we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus , powered by kinetic energy . # PM: There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . # PM: perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . # PM: looking like a scroll , but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling that was actually in use , that is behind the scenes is push button which we according to Kate have a very good grasp on doing that in production . # PM: we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management . # PM: and as suggested yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us . # PM: we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time . # PM: we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one . # PM: And we closed as it ran out of time . # PM: Is that a fair presentation of what happened ? # PM: back to this meeting . # PM: we're down to the prototype presentation . # UI: well you see , each made one , we didn't have enough yellow dough . # UI: This is the one that I made . # UI: It is curved , easy to hold , hand-held , nice and small with big easy buttons . # UI: This is like a scroll , but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus . # UI: Of course we need someone who's experienced with the television . # UI: I mean this is the infrared thing that's gonna zap at the television . # UI: I'm not quite sure how to make that , but I'm sure it will work . # UI: this is on off switch , 'cause I think we do need that , and I think it gives it a nice balance . # UI: And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it in there . # UI: as for what it's actually made of the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right in the different menus . # UI: position , I presume that just means right on it , easy to see . # UI: The main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , lack of buttons all over the place . # UI: Form curved , kind of smooth , hand-held , makes it feel nice to hold . # UI: material , I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit , but I think we have two different options , because we did make a another one , which wa is in the shape of banana , it's just if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana , which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , just a slightly different design . # UI: Also with on off switch and infrared I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic . # UI: So like well , I dunno , what's it like ? # UI: I guess like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth . # UI: Whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one or mix and match , just we were gonna see what you thought , a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons . # UI: we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints . # UI: And what we what conclusion we reach when we discuss it . # UI: material , that's what I have to say about material . # UI: Can I scroll down on there and see what else colour , I think I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons , because that's the company colours , but if anybody's got any other suggestions , I'm quite willing to consider them as well . # UI: it just depends what you think about these ideas and if I'm maybe , Kate , you better say what you think about them . # ID: I don't have very much to add . # ID: the case that's the on off button just come off our prototype . # ID: The the case can be either spongy rubber or hard plastic . # ID: We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two , but it can be either of those . # ID: We have the technology to do that . # ID: and as for the actual components , Steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture . # ID: We have simple rubber push buttons which provide all the functionality we need . # ID: the diode that actually does the infrared is at the end , it's the stalk of the banana , or it's just the thing at the end of this version . # ID: that's for material . # ID: Colour , well Steph's the expert on colour . # ID: we don't have any particular restrictions on that . # ID: I think that's all we've got to say really . # UI: I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped . # UI: This one has n banana , . # UI: This one has no obvious connections to fruit , but because it's round and molded , it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , it's more like you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , which I quite like that sort of image . # UI: 'Cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly # ID: Would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ? # UI: Hold them , you see , you know . # UI: Curvature , is it to your liking ? # PM: Oh I see , the on-off's in the back . # ID: that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it . # UI: If you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all . # PM: And then you can use your thumb . # ID: And it was partly we thought the design looked better , # PM: I could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having a problem with the you know # UI: Breaking , oh right . # UI: Well you see , that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it , because then it'd just be rigid . # ME: I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role . # UI: we really like we really like that design , # ME: It's really kind of a # UI: I mean it looks just like a logo , that arrangement of the keys . # UI: Like a c like a compass point , you know , just up , down , left and right , and we think we could make that quite a good feature . # UI: And it's like the iPod scroll wheel , but better . # ME: But it's also like texting , you don't # UI: I mean it that's what it makes me think of , mobile phones , I was try I was thinking , moving your thumb like this , what does that remind me of ? # ID: And it's a very simple design , # ID: there's not a lot to wrong , the components are cheap to make . # ME: It's also in terms of being lost it's quite it looks quite different . # ME: You know , I d I have several four remotes , and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to you know , this is really identifiable . # UI: I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of I mean actually how to program the menus and what sort of , you know , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen , but we do definitely think that it's a viable option . # PM: The next item is evaluation . # PM: if that's if you're finished . # UI: , we're finished . # ME: shall I take your power ? # ME: This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation , and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department . # ME: this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by the consumers a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this evaluation exercise . # ME: I'm going to go and use the whiteboard , and I've made a list of criteria to look at , and so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave this up as the last thing , but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , one true seven false and I'm gonna now use the board . # ME: Okay . So fancy , technologically innovative , easy to use , trendy , buttons , excess buttons , good buttons , ugly , sellable , and other . # ME: And in fact I hope that you all introduce some additional terms , because these are things that have been brought up , some of them seem rather close , # UI: what about price , is that gonna go on there as well ? Price of materials . # ME: like they overlap . # ME: We'll put price up at the top . # UI: Not that we actually know anything about it , but we can we can pretend . # PM: we will soon , unfortunately . # ME: wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ? # UI: It depends what you mean by fancy really , 'cause when I think of fancy , I think of it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and , you know , like baroque curliness and which I'd call these quite minimalist , # ID: a plain , simple , clean design . # UI: simple and plain , but I mean I do see what it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , so in that respect it is quite fancy . # ME: in that respect I think we'll go with that respect . # UI: I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy , I'd say maybe aesthetic . # ID: we have got s trendy further down , # ID: Elegant , I don't know if I'd call them elegant . # ME: these aren't the exact terms that the # UI: like stylish or aesthetic . # ME: Elegant . We're gon let's use elegant , although the people , the word on the street is # UI: Did you just break the pen ? # ME: let's take it to the next level . # UI: we'll just call it fancy then . # ME: Well okay , so in terms of elegant , fancy . we'll call it E_F_ , do we do we think that perhaps and maybe we should say the yellow ? # ME: Should we go with the yellow in terms of I think that's a really superior # UI: I think we n we need to # UI: they're both yellow with black buttons , it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent that , but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black . # UI: So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two that isn't that is more curved , like a banana , but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff , # ME: I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana . # ME: And of the two I really like I m I like the banana , # ME: but I do like the chunk . # UI: that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now , Just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two . # ME: but I mean in terms we have to evaluate one of them . # ME: Unless do you guys wanna evaluate both ? # PM: I think between the two , somewhere between the two is true . # PM: It's more true than false , about a two . # ME: technologically innovative . # ID: I d I don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept . # ID: I think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative . # ME: we'll say we'll say false . # ME: is that inappropriate ? # ME: trendy , s and I say specifically spongy fruity . # UI: maybe only a two or a three then , 'cause it's no we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific # ID: We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's curved as a banana but spongy . # UI: I don't really think that's gonna work , # PM: Excess buttons . # ME: are there excess buttons ? # ME: That is false . # ID: So that's false . # ME: good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons . # PM: Better , more intuitive buttons , yes . # ME: People don't respond well to ugly . # ME: Sellable , quirky , you know , something people # ID: I think they're different , aren't they ? # UI: it is quite it is quite quirky I think . # UI: It could be quite a good brand , like a good little object . # ME: And I was I was thinking of other things in terms of could we say it's cost saving ? # UI: we also need tho think about the energy . # UI: Is it the kinetic energy ? # ME: , with the energy . # UI: it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy . # ME: It is going to be kinetic ? # ME: we'll c we'll say it's a cost saving enviro . # UI: but we haven't completely developed that side of it yet , so we're not completely sure about that , # ME: you're still in the Play-Doh stage . # ME: Anything else ? Including price , do you have any idea about price or other features ? # ID: I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . # ID: We haven't got a lot of expensive components in there . # PM: Yes , the instinct says true . # ME: So true one or should I go to two or three ? # ID: I'd put it at one I think , I dunno , what do you # UI: I would say maybe a two , 'cause we still we need to get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus and things . # UI: I mean it's not just like I mean it's not like ev you know , on a normal chunky remote every button res I mean means something different , # PM: that's not a cheap thing to get . # ID: it might be the # UI: whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all they mean everything , depending on what menu you're in . # ID: , that's a good point . # UI: we need somebody to develop that . # ME: other ? Anything else you guys can thing of ? # ME: And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these so then I'm gonna instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true , so that 'cause I have to do an average . # ME: And then excess buttons . # UI: Just putting no excess buttons . # ME: Wow we're doing really well . # ME: you know , so it doesn't ruin the polarity . # UI: see if we're technologically innovative , I'd say it is quite innovative , because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons . # UI: I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition but we are at the upper end of the push button market . # ME: if you g let me know if any of these if you if you all can think of any other thing to change here if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features . # ME: If not I'll average those . # PM: I think we're good . # PM: We're a little over halfway through the meeting and the next big thing is the finance . # ME: how about if I pass this back to you and I'll figure out the average here . # ME: Thank you for everyone's help with that . # PM: And as you can see it says the same thing , it had not lost itself , thank Goodness . # PM: And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet that they provided to me . # PM: it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device . # PM: Hand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells . # UI: just kinetic then , . # PM: what's a hand dynamo ? # ID: That was the crank , wind-up crank on the side . # UI: It's the wind-up . # PM: Kinetic is and how many of those will we need per we only need one . # PM: Electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those . # ID: , I think we can do it all with simple Just checking that . # ID: , simple , 'cause we've just got push buttons , so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest . # PM: and we only need one of those . # PM: the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve . # PM: It looks like it single curve , 'cause of th the chunkiness . # ID: that one is single curve , # UI: What does double curved mean , I don't understand . # ID: I think you it means you reverse the curve . # PM: that's the one that goes like this . # ID: . , I do I don't think we need that for either of them , # UI: no , we don't need that . No . # ID: you can do a banana in single curve , # UI: Single-curved , I'd say . # PM: single curve . # PM: case material supplements . Plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour . # UI: I just wanna say plastic . # PM: We had the special colour . # PM: And did we say plastic ? # ID: can we do some what ifs , 'cause it may I mean I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , # ME: One , two , three , four , five , six . # ID: but it depends on the cost , I guess . # PM: Okay . We'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added at the moment , that's where we are . # PM: Interface button push button interface . That's what we're using , # UI: It's just button . # ID: Do we need to say how many buttons , # PM: Whoops , don't want that , not yet . # ID: or d is it just one ? # PM: it just says push button interface . # PM: Button supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black . # PM: And the buttons Wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ? # ID: they'll be rubber , yep . # PM: So we need one of them . # PM: And are they any special form ? # UI: like the compass point one . # ID: Actually , does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ? # ID: 'Cause I think they can be plastic . # PM: 'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top . # ID: They could be plastic , we don't have to have rubber buttons , because we haven't got a double curved case . # UI: , they could be plastic . # PM: let's put that rubber in then , of the case material supplement . # ID: It's just one , isn't it ? # PM: we only need one of them . # PM: and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed . # PM: I'm going to save this into our desktop , project documents . Okay . As our project document bit . # ID: Do you do you need to double click on that to open it ? # PM: That's the only Excel document that will be in there , so it's there for all of us . # PM: Okay , so , are they under twelve fifty ? # PM: go to the project evaluation , next slide . # PM: the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity . # PM: leadership , teamwork , means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things . # ID: , the Play-Doh was best , I thought . # UI: 'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder . # UI: So much better just to go and , you know , this is it , this is what we want . # PM: Okay . So , we went over all those things and we're satisfied with all the above . # PM: did we find any new ideas ? # ME: I think with the marketing element of fruit shaped I mean I that really opened my eyes . # ME: I only speak for myself though . # UI: And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before , Good work as a design team , # ID: , I think we're a good team actually . # ID: I'm not sure all the wires are really great though . # PM: we actually worked well as a group . # PM: Are the costs within the budget ? # PM: Is the project evaluated ? # ME: I can give you a number , # ID: hang on , we haven't heard . # ME: the average evaluation score is one point eight , so it means w you know , I can I can spell it out . # ME: There were six true or ones , pardon me , two s almost true or close to true , so that was four points , and then one false , seven points , so seventeen divided by nine we're between one and two . # ME: I would say that's ex excellent in terms of ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the market place . # UI: And the only false one is because we've chosen to keep a simple old technology , # ME: To maintain old technology , exactly . # UI: which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works , # ID: Absolutely , and it's kept us within budget . # UI: So we do count as I think excellent or one . # PM: And we've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , I have a final report to present , and then we're done . # PM: We done good , and we're finished in time . # UI: Bring on the ice sculptures . # ID: And then we get the product launch party . # ME: we might have to wait . # ID: Product launch party ? # UI: That's what I said , ice sculptures . # ME: I one thing I want to do is I think the meeting's done . # PM: I believe that is the end of our meeting . # PM: Thank you , Melissa . # ME: one thing I wa I wanna do is save everything in the right files , because I don't think everything is saved . # ME: The right files . Final meeting market .
# PM: Alright , that did nothing . # PM: Welcome to the meeting everyone . # PM: Just gonna attempt to make this into a slide show . # ME: You may have to do the function F_ eight thing . # PM: This'll just take a moment . # PM: Okay we'll have to deal with it like this then . # PM: This is the first meeting for developing our , our new product . # PM: I'm Heather , I'm your Project Manager . # PM: So that was the opening . # PM: The first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another . # PM: If everyone could go around and explain their role and , and their name . # ID: My name's Poppy . # ID: I'm the Industrial Designer for this project . # ID: , I'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase . # ID: Also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product . # PM: Nice to meet you Poppy . # UI: My name's Tara and I'm the User Interface Designer . # UI: I will also be responsible for the functional design phase , the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design . # ME: I'm Genevieve . # ME: I'm the Marketing Expert . # ME: I'm an expert at marketing . # ME: , I'll be telling you guys about the user requirement specifications for our new product . # ME: , I'll be doing some trend-watching in the conceptual design , and product evaluation for the design phase . # PM: Alright I'm Heather and I've I said I'm your Project Manager , Well you can pretty much read what it is that I'm doing . # PM: And tool training is one thing that we're going to be doing today , um as well as planning the project , how we're going to , create this product , and , discuss , our aims and objects of this , Which brings us to our next subject , as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control . # PM: , we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy , a completely new style , so that , can really appeal to a , to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of , channel-changer . # PM: And , it needs to be user-friendly for , maybe , for an example , for people that , can't see the numbers as well , or , perhaps an ergonomic design . # ID: So this is a television remote control ? # PM: Yes , it's a television remote control . # PM: I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now . # PM: , the way that we're going to go about this is , we'll have a time where we can , come up with new ideas alone , and , and work on the project and then , after we've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in a meeting and , and discuss what , what , what kind of functional design we want to use . # PM: Same with conceptual design and detailed design . # PM: making sure that it , it's usable , that as a , and that it's , it's feasible to create , and , to come up with a concept of it want , what we want it to look like . # PM: , tool training . # PM: Is , is everyone , # ID: Got those notes . # PM: One thing that , we're going to do is become more acquainted with the , the tools that we have access to for our project . # PM: , one of them is our whiteboard . # PM: And , as a sort of team-building moment , I , I'd like us to , try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal . # PM: , why that , why that should be your favourite animal . # PM: I'm assuming that we should do that now . # PM: With our microphones still attached to our bodies . # PM: 'Kay , what's my favourite animal ? # PM: This is a team-building time # ID: are we all doing it individually ? # ID: let's stand up and support you # PM: okay cool , My favourite animal , which changes all the time , okay , right now it is an elk . # PM: And it goes like it's got like big antlers , Looks kinda like , like it has holly growing out of its head . # ID: Do you have elk where you come from ? # ME: We have moose too . # PM: we have moose and we have deer . # UI: We have sheep . # ID: That's a great elk . # ME: Uh-oh , we have a good artist . # UI: That is really good . # ME: very shapely . # PM: That's a sketching of my elk , and it , it is my favourite animal right now , 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature , that , that In a way it looks kind of awkward , because it's on spindly legs But it can really overcome harsh terrain , and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous , because it has strong antlers , it can really combat its enemies , even like it it's a it's an herbivore but , it can really defend itself . # PM: I'm gonna take minutes while , you guys express your favourite animals . # ID: Okay , I'll go next . # ID: I am a big animal lover . # ID: like all sorts of animals , but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently . # ID: It's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing , but never mind . # ID: Not as artistic as Heather's drawing . # ID: Bit more cartoon style . # ID: But I like cats because they're so independent , and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing . # ID: , but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable , 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well , and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and , running around outside as well as being inside , and enjoying their food , and generally just , they just seemed so cool and they just know what they're doing . # ID: I reckon they're sort of , they got it sorted . # ID: They know what they want . # ID: Basically , that's why I like cats . # ID: I'll rub that out . # UI: I think my favourite animal would be a dog , but I'm not really sure how to draw one . # UI: I , I've never drawn a dog , I don't think . # UI: I'm tempted to draw a snail 'cause I draw them sometimes and they're really easy to draw . # PM: I forget her name . # UI: it's gonna be a really funny dog , 'cause I'm not sure how to draw a dog . # ID: Well there are loads of different types of dogs , so I'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog . # UI: It's a cartoon dog I think . # UI: A s I don't ev Oh , oh well . # UI: It's a scary cartoon dog . # UI: That This , that does not look like a dog . # PM: It looks kinda like a person . # ID: We can pretend . # ME: That's Pinocchio . # UI: How do you draw a dog ? # UI: I suppose it has a lon Oh my god . # UI: Yous know what it's supposed to be . # UI: , I like dogs because , they're so good to humans , like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs , and they're just such friendly animals . # UI: And , like they're more of a companion than cats . # UI: I've nothing against cats . # UI: Cats don't really like me , so I can't like them . # UI: But they're just so friendly and warm and nice animals , that don't look like that . # ME: I feel like a robot . # ME: well I guess I had the most time to think about it . # ME: I'm going to draw a butterfly , because I saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving . # ME: And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild , and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland . # ME: It was like , well it was a little pointier than that . # ME: At first I thought it was a dead leaf . # ME: And then it landed on the wall next to me . # ME: But this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this . # ME: And then it kinda there was a green , I think it was a green ring , and there was like red going out like this . # PM: It's kinda like a peacock . # ME: , it kinda was actually , 'cause it was This part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and I'm like , wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March . # ME: So I thought that was pretty cool . # ME: And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . # ME: I wish I'd had my camera . # ME: So that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here . # PM: Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ? # PM: So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , the next , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our budget , or not meet our budget but more , like what kind of , selling range we'll be looking at , wanna make this selling price of twenty five Euros . # PM: And so we have to , come up with a way to , to create a , a remote control , where we can like the price to create it will be significantly less . # PM: , we'd like to , to , make fifty million Euro . # PM: I'm assuming that's what the M_ means . # PM: , and make it for an international market . # PM: , one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , like different kinds of , V_C_R_s . # PM: Things like that , depending on which country you are . # PM: Another thing for the design team to think about . # PM: , we want it to cost , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents . # ME: so we'll have a hundred percent profit then ? # ME: Twelve fifty . # PM: I'm bad at math . # PM: so now that , that is underway , it is discussion time . # PM: So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any suggestions that you may have so far , a your personal experiences with remote controls , and , areas you see that , could be improved in your experience with them . # PM: Does anyone have any initial thoughts ? # ME: I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing . # PM: So what's something we could , do to remedy that ? # ID: I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing . # ID: It's always , where is the remote control ? # ID: So maybe if you could have some kind of tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was . # ID: I dunno , some kind of alarm . # ID: You can press a button on your wall , signal , # PM: It's a great idea . It's a great idea . # ID: 'cause it always gets lost . # UI: Do yous not find that , like , there's a lot of , buttons on your remote control , and you don't know what half of them do . # ID: , that you don't use half of them . # UI: , I don't know what they do . # ME: There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something . # ME: That's useful . # ME: So you just have like the number buttons , power button , T_V_ video button . # PM: Anything about , the look of the , remote control that you might have ideas about . # PM: Maybe it could be , instead of like a standard rectangular shape , it could be , something more interesting like Any ideas will do that you have at this point . # ME: Could be shaped like a conch , # ME: Be like a shell-shaped remote . # ID: Are we going into kind of novelty factors here . # ID: Like , I've seen phones like a # PM: Well if it's a trendy original , aspect we're going for . # PM: I mean , you're the designers , you c , you can decide what kind of , direction you wanna go in , but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there . # ID: I suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing . # ID: Like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general kind of more acceptable But we don't wanna go towards boring , 'cause that wouldn't sell either . # PM: And the key issue here is , is being trendy and original . # PM: , that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous . # PM: Okay we have five minutes left . # PM: So , just to cover We have one more thing . # PM: , like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times . # PM: , our next meeting will be in half an hour . # PM: So you have half an hour to , think about what you want to present . # PM: Or not present but bring to the meeting . # PM: , I_D_ , whatever that stands for . # ID: Industrial Designer . # PM: Industrial Designer . # ME: Oh , industrial . # PM: I have to remember these things . # PM: You'll be beginning your , your working design . # PM: , U_I_D_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . # PM: , maybe how this can be achieved , and , we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert . # ME: Marketing Expert . # PM: , you will get specific instructions , of what to do in the next half an hour . # PM: And I'll see you in half an hour ,
# ID: That's okay . That's okay . # PM: Am I starting now ? # PM: 'Kay , . Alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . # PM: And I hope you had a productive last thirty minutes . # PM: I'll be taking minutes on this one , and Being hooked up to the PowerPoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for myself , because it'll be more about , what you guys are bringing to the meeting today . # PM: the first presentation we'll be looking at is Poppy's presentation . # PM: take it away Poppy . # PM: It's , it's plugged in . # UI: F_ eight , w . Function F_ eight . # ID: F_ okay . Function F_ eight . # ID: Sorry about this guys . # ID: I will take this time just to apologise . # ID: I , I only , received my emails later on . 'Cause I was too busy carried away doing my own thing , which is not obviously not a very good part of a team-working thing . # ID: But there we go . # PM: I'm sure it's fine . # ID: , so I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do . # ID: And it needs to allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are . # ID: They don't need to actually manually touch the television set . # ID: So , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be . # ID: , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique . # ID: , one is the visibility in the dark , which was Genevieve's idea . # ID: So we need to think about how we could bring this in technically . # ID: And we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone , or something fam familiar . # ID: A automatically , lights up at first touch . # ID: Or we could use fluorescent materials which would just take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark . # ID: , also we could use an alarm . # ID: So if we lost the remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room . # ID: Maybe behind a cushion or somewhere . # ID: , so that would work . # ID: Go back there . # ID: , another thing I think we d missed out on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . # ID: , from previous researches I've carried out on other projects , we've learnt about smart materials where um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory . # ID: So they can be heated and cooled , and they change the shape of the metal . # ID: So , for example , a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . # ID: So , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , everything would spring apart . # ID: So , all the individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and I think that would be very important for products now . # ID: Especially 'cause there's much responsibility for all the companies who are coming up with like new designs . # ID: 'Cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious . # PM: one question . # PM: This , self-destructible metal , it allows for recycling materials ? # PM: So that , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ? # ID: And then they would , you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy . # ID: And that's the part that would allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . # ID: I mean , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made . # ID: , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components , and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . # ID: Something like the case , if it's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else . # PM: Would we be the company that would break down these , or metals ? # PM: Or would we contribute to another group ? # ID: You could we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us . # ID: But it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made . # ID: For a certain percentage at least . # ID: Not every , not a hundred percent of everything we produce , # PM: This sounds like a really great idea . # PM: One thing we have to consider is our one hundred percent turnover goal that we have for our financial sector . # PM: , so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive . # PM: You would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive . # ID: the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they don't need to be manually de deconstructed . # ID: Like , you don't have to individually unscrew all the screws . # ID: Because of this , their properties are smart material . # ID: All you need is just the heat , so they self-destruct themselves . # PM: We'll still have to investigate the financial implications . # ID: So I suppose it does need like high contact , you know high quality machinery , and very specific machinery , # PM: I like the environmental approach . # PM: , we'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well . # ID: also there is components . # ID: This'll be how it will actually work . # ID: But I haven't put this plan together yet . # PM: I'm sorry , could you # ID: should I go back . # ID: This would actually show the circuit diagram . # ID: Although I haven't come up with the final circuit yet . # ID: So I just put all those components in . # PM: So those are what , we'll c construct the remote . # PM: Those are all the # ID: I it just shows what sort of energy source . # ID: It could be a battery , like rechargeable probably . # ID: , an' , well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself . # PM: Alright . Great . # ID: So , now is it F_ eight again to escape ? # PM: Thank you very much . # PM: And , the next presenter will be Tara . # ID: There you go Tara . # UI: Do you think Is it , function eight ? # ID: Function F_ eight . # ME: Function F_ eight . # PM: Function F_ eight . # ID: The one at the top . # ME: That looks right . # UI: I'm the User Interface Designer . # UI: , the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have . # UI: , in this case it's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . # UI: By taking inspiration from other similar designs , we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international . # UI: There're two functional design options . # UI: A multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices . # UI: And a single function remote control , used specifically for the television . # ME: I'm sorry , what was that last one . Multifunctional and # UI: , a single function just for the television itself . # UI: , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing . # UI: A single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices . # UI: , I think that a single function remote control would be preferable , because it's easier to use . # UI: It'd be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable . # UI: , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . # UI: And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . # UI: And less functions would have to be included . # UI: So it would be cheaper to make . # UI: And probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices . # UI: Does anyone have any questions ? # ME: So as far as we know , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ? # UI: Well , it's just that , when we're creating it , we're , we have to make it compatible with different brands of devices . # UI: And it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent , # UI: other entertainment devices . # PM: Does everyone agree with this ? # PM: Does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ? # ID: , I was just wondering about the , what , what Genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . # ID: And that would probably , I d , well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . # ID: I suppose having that would complicate it a lot more . # ID: And limit the design . # ME: I think I agree with the single design thing for now , because we're trying to do so much , that if we're trying to make a unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it's also multi also multifunctional , we're gonna go over budget for one thing . # UI: And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design . # UI: We'll have more money to go into the design side of it . # PM: Alright . Sounds great . # PM: Alright , well , are you ready for your presentation Genevieve ? # PM: Except you're not hooked up to the # ME: I'm not hooked up , but other than that , completely ready . # ME: I just lost my microphone . # ME: Just a moment . # ME: Okay . So I'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control . # ME: , and I'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly . # ME: , if you all remember from the email we got before our very first kick-off meeting , with the coffee machine ? # ME: The functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly . # ME: , so what I'll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control . # ME: , so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled . # ME: , I've done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , and some internet research . # ME: And I'll show you my findings . # ME: and firstly I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose . # ME: So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products . # ME: , hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics . # ME: So I think that should be our priority here . # ME: , and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design . Not just in electronic fashion . # ME: So that it's something that fits in the household . # PM: I'm sorry , what was that last thing that you just said ? # ME: , we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design . # ME: Any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media , you know who's famous , what T_V_ shows are being watched , to influence our remote control . # ME: Okay , so the findings . # ME: , seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly . # ME: Which is a , quite a significant number . # ME: , the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them , you know , neutral . # ME: Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . # ME: Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . # PM: I'm sorry , that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . # PM: You mean that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control ? # ME: , they're willing , they're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality . # ME: As opposed to your basic , you know , oval black , all same size button remote control . # ME: , so it is something that people care about . It's not , it's not ignored in the household . # ME: , seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot . # ME: Zapping meaning they go through channels a lot . # ME: They're you know thumb-masters . # ME: , and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . # ME: That A very small amount . # ME: Thought that was interesting . # PM: Alright , so it might be very appealing if , we have very concise buttons . # ID: the single function . # PM: And another thing with lots of surfing , we'd probably have to work on something that could be a lot more durable , because I find with channel-changers that , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button . # ID: that's a good point . # ME: And actually to go with that , I'm gonna give you some statistics on the relevancy of the buttons , how much they're used . # ME: And how important the users find them . # ME: So the power button , obviously , in an hour is only used once . # ME: Hopefully the person's not turning on and off the T_V_ . # ME: , but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten . # ME: So people wanna be able to turn on the T_V_ with the remote control . # ME: , as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set . # ME: Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour . # ME: That's a huge amount . # ME: This is the most important button . # ME: , so obviously when commercials come on they're changing it , so as you said we want a durable button that's not gonna run down . # ME: Relevance of that button , our users found was ten , ten out of ten . # ME: , ditto for volume selection , so ten out of ten . # ME: And it's used on average four times an hour . # ME: Not as much as channel selection , but still significant . # ME: , audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour . # ME: Relevance is two . # ME: Screen settings , which means brightness , colour etcetera , zero point five times an hour . # ME: , and relevance of one point five . # ME: We're getting to specific statistics here . # ME: Teletext , now I'm not too clear on what that is . # ME: I don't know if you can help me . # ME: Flipping pages . # ID: It's like the news . # ID: Or like information . # UI: T_V_ has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment . # ME: So like a running banner , underneath # PM: it's a button that you press , and then you , like a menu pops up . # PM: I haven't used it before # UI: And you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it'll come up . # ID: It's like very basic internet . Sort of , # UI: Very basic internet , . # ME: Like tells you the weather , and # UI: But you have no interaction back with it , you know . # UI: Like the internet you can send emails and You've no interaction . # ID: it's just information that , like television timetables , what's on , what's on now , what's on next , on every channel , and # ME: Well I guess I'm not with it , because I wasn't But it's , it's being used fourteen times an hour . # ME: , and has a r a high relevance of six point five . # ME: So it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control . # ME: , channel settings . Zero point zero one times an hour . Relevance of three . # ME: Channel settings . # UI: , probably just tuning in the channels , would it be ? # ME: Changing the channels ? # UI: Tuning them in at the very start . # UI: You know if you get a new T_V_ set , you tune in all the channels , # ID: To get the right reception and picture , I suppose . # UI: do you th do you think ? # ME: , so it's not used very often , but people still find it relevant . # ME: , biggest frustrations of the people that we interviewed . # ME: Remote controls are often lost somewhere . # ME: So that was already discussed by Poppy . How we could have a , an alarm system so that people can find it . # ME: , takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . # ME: So it should be very user-friendly , you know . # ME: People know what to do very quickly . # ME: , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . # ID: Repetitive strain injury . # ME: Is that what it is ? # ME: People with arthritis and such ? # PM: That's rather sad . # ID: Oh , I'm guessing that's what it is . # ME: designers can look into that . # ME: , buttons that don't require , you know , very firm pushing , if they respond . # ME: But we'll have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well . # ME: That's a problem . # ME: Did you guys get that one down ? # ME: here's some ideas for you . # ME: A large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls . # ME: So I'll show you some numbers here . # ME: , so the youngest age group , fifteen to twenty five . # ME: Ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control . # ME: , and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s Interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount . , that would , are willing to pay extra . # ME: So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're , we're targeting , and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into . # ME: And if we have the budget for it . # ME: , if we are targeting young adults , it looks like something that would pay off . # ME: Seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it . # PM: I agree with if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into . # PM: , financially and functionally . # PM: , and especially if we are trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that . # PM: , ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be as concerned . # ME: So that , that's a whole other field of research . # ME: I don't know if it'd be , if we'd still have a remote , or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel . # ME: and depending on how many members you have in households . # ME: So it m it may be too complicated for us , but it's something to keep in mind anyway . # PM: And something that might further complicate it is that the T_V_ makes noise itself . # PM: Wonder if it would have # ID: And if there was conversation in the room at the same time , although in theory it doesn't tend to be when you're watching television , but could be very difficult to get the specific design . # PM: If we're looking for a simplistic design , We need to decide if that is our intention is , is a simplistic design . # PM: , because if , if it is then I think voice , voice-activated # ME: It looks like # PM: and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing , because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using a , they won't be talking into a remote , I'm sure . # ME: It'd be like the ultimate remote . # ME: And th the last thing here was a , an L_C_D_ screen . # ME: So , I mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us . # ME: Not practical . # ME: an L_C_D_ screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working . # ME: So that you don't have so many buttons to deal with . # PM: , I don't know what an L_C_D_ screen is . # ME: Oh sorry , just , just a screen , like a computer screen . # UI: Mobile phone . # ME: Or Like an alarm clock . # ME: You'd have an L_C_D_ versus just a , a normal clock . # ID: What , what would appear on the screen ? # PM: I have no idea still . # ME: Oh just like an electronic screen . # ME: As opposed to just buttons . There would be like a little , like on # PM: Oh , on the remote . # ME: Like on the top of a cellphone , the little L_C_D_ screen . # ME: , now that's , I , I dunno exactly what exactly we'd put on there . # ME: I guess the channel that you're on , the v the volume setting . # UI: Could it It would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next . # UI: But that would probably be # ID: Like linked in with the teletext , # UI: That would be good , . # ID: or sort of like an teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television . # UI: Might be quite expensive to do that though . # ME: Well I guess that's something we can all take back to our respective research . # ME: , and finally , whoops , my personal preferences and thoughts . # ME: , I think our priority really should be unique design . # ME: , we want something that people want in their home . # ME: Every remote control looks the same , so in my opinion it should be , user-friendly and unique . # ME: So the other stuff might be a little too , a little too gadgety for some people . # ME: , I th myself , voice recognition kind of scares me off . # ME: So if we're , if we're aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product , and for all , the other thing is like age market . # ME: I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff . # ME: But if we wanna make fifty million , and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe stick to the basics . # UI: And we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five Euros to spend on a remote control . # UI: Like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they're just starting out # ME: And we have to keep in mind the , the reliability of our research . # ME: I mean , you know , a sixteen year old boy would say , I'd pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that's three months allowance . # ME: , so I think , I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more . # UI: Early twenties , that's the kind of age group . # PM: And if one of the largest , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control , # PM: I'm sure that something like an L_C_D_ screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem . # ID: Complicated jus complicating things even fo Mm . # ME: That's it for the market research . # PM: Before we go into more discussion on we want this design to look like , I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions . # PM: , for one thing , because Having controls with D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control . , we've decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television function . # PM: Which is good as , as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway . # PM: , for many reasons . # PM: So we have that decision sort of made for us . # PM: Another thing that might affect other decisions is that the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now . # PM: And so we won't concern ourselves with navigating the teletext option . # ID: Can I just interrupt ? # ID: Would you like to plug in your # ME: Maybe we can do the # ID: Have you got a PowerPoint or not ? # PM: I'm looking at looking at it right now . # ME: Oh , come back screen . # ID: Were they , was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext , or just avoiding both altogether ? # PM: I mean we don't have the resources or possibility of using the internet with the remote control , but they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used . # PM: Alright , and another thing . # PM: This is for the design , the design of the product is that we wanna create , more of a sense that people know that this is from our company . # PM: So , all the remote controls must have our We'll incorporate our logo and colour in some way . # PM: So , perhaps our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good . # PM: , it doesn't have to be the colour of our of our company but , another thing is that , we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon . # PM: , I'm assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting I , I wasn't offered a , like a type of logo or colour , so if that could be somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable . # ME: It's probably R_ R_R_ in yellow . # PM: The little R_ yellow thing ? # PM: Real Reaction ? # PM: , yes , those are the changes . # PM: , so , now we need to discuss , and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be . # PM: I'm just going to look at my notes for a second . # PM: , we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control . # PM: So , we already know that it'll just be for the television . # PM: It'll It won't have teletext . # PM: But , you know , we could discuss those other options that you brought up , Genevieve . # ME: Okay , so I Are we going to write off the L_C_D_ option ? # PM: Is that how most people feel about that ? # ME: So no L_C_D_ , no teletext , and no voice recognition . # UI: I think it would be annoying though if I don't use teletext that much , but if it was on your T_V_ , you'd want to be able to use it , # PM: but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd , I know for one that in North America there is no such thing as teletext , so it'd be really superfluous . # ME: Never heard of it . # PM: I don't know about other countries besides the U_K_ . # PM: Do you know if anywhere else has it ? # ID: More research required , I think . # ID: Was it a management decision that we're having # PM: It was a management decision , so it's , it's pretty much out of our hands at this point . # PM: So , I guess we're looking at something rather simple . # ME: , well I guess , just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons . # ME: And the What was the word they used ? # ME: F findability is important . # PM: I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had . # PM: 'Cause I'm sure that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared # ID: The same signalling . # PM: the same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise . # PM: It's not that expensive to do . # ID: Or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone . # ID: Like you just a , a buzz or something . # PM: Okay . I like that idea . # UI: Would you be able to , put the little device anywhere ? # UI: 'Cause isn't our remote control for all T_V_s , you'd ha # ID: Do you mean the link between the # UI: , with the button that you pressed . # ID: Well , if the button was actually on # PM: Minor detail there . # UI: C 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one T_V_ set , so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , or something . # PM: , it would have t # ID: Maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be not very obtrusive . # ID: Obviously something small that's , that's a good point . # PM: Then it wouldn't , it probably wouldn't be able to use It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller . # UI: Would it need a battery then ? # ID: Unless it could be # PM: That's your department you'll have to sort that out . # ID: , unless some way , it could have some universal connection to like the socket , the same socket that the T_V_'s supplied from . # ID: I mean the power for the T_V_ . # PM: , you'll have to # ID: So , mm , more research into that one . # PM: you'll have to investi Do some research on that , alright ? # PM: , alright , and I'm sure that , the glow-in-the-dark , fluorescent , whatever , system , is a go ahead . # PM: Is everyone interested in that ? # ME: On the buttons ? # UI: I like the light up suggestion . # UI: I think that would be better . # UI: 'Cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time , so # UI: I would go for # ME: It could it could be a tactile thing as well . # ME: right , if w if we're minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger . # ME: And there's something on it . # ME: S you know like up arrow down arrow for , for volume . # ID: Like a raised # ME: , and I don't know what we could do for , for channels . S # UI: Well just the numbers could be embossed , couldn't it ? # ME: The numbers themselves . # UI: Could be raised . # ME: But then the like up button and down button for the channel , channel changing . # UI: Just little arrows , that you could feel , maybe ? # ME: I just thought that it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up . # ID: And also y , Heather you mentioned before , like how it should be accessible to everybody . # ID: , so like big b buttons , for people you are visually impaired . # ID: The glow-in-the-dark or light up won't make any difference anyway . # ID: So like you say tactile might be better , because it'd be more available to everybody . # UI: That , I think that's good , . # PM: Could we somehow We could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material . # PM: 'Cause I d I don't think that glow-in-the-dark material , like the actual soft plastic , costs that much more than other colours . # ID: No , it's not these days . # UI: No , I wouldn't say so . # ID: I mean , it's quite easily accessible . # ME: I guess the other option , referring to the battery thing is , you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something , when you're s and then it goes , # UI: That's good that a good idea . # ME: so if , if you're like changing the volume during a movie . # ME: I know , I'm thinking of mostly when you're watching a movie you turn all the lights off right . # ME: And you don't want to turn on the lights , to turn it down , because there's suddenly an explosion , and it's gonna wake up the baby . # ME: , so if you touch the button , it kind of reactivates it . # ME: It lights up for # UI: That , that's a good idea . # ME: On self timer . # ID: So self-timed lighting . # PM: Alright we have five minutes left , for the meeting , but I think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close . # PM: , what was I missed the last moment , reading that . # PM: What were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ? # ME: Oh , just if it was kinda the same way that a cell You know how a cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch a button , after having not touched it for a while . # ME: , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again . # PM: Mm . So it could be any button that would be pressed . # ME: and you , you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit , and it gives a faint glow . # ID: So , self-timed # ME: So if you have all the lights off in your living room , you'll , you'll temporarily see it . # ME: Because usually you're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds . # PM: Okay , so That's probably feasible . # PM: So , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow-in-the-dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ? # PM: Do we have to kind of decide what we're gonna do with this . # ID: I think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea . # ID: And I think that's un unique as well . # UI: For visually impaired , . # ID: I mean , I haven't seen that . # ID: And as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just sort of like painted on , you know printed . # PM: And it could , if it's that softer rubber material it'll be , maybe , better for people with els no # PM: what's it called , R_S_I_ , what was it that we were talking about ? # PM: instead of like hard buttons . # ID: Repetitive strain injury . # PM: , did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ? # PM: Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ? # PM: Like should we do both ? # PM: Or we can have one or the other ? # PM: Because it might , for , for our design purposes , I mean , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a funny kinda colour . # PM: And it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with . # ME: I was gonna say , Exactly . # ME: it might be perceived as tacky , glow-in-the-dark . # ME: It's kind of like Eighties neon-style . # ME: , whereas we're trying to be trendy and fashionable . # ID: there are now like loads , or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well , which could like link in with the company colours . # ID: Like it could be blue or green or yellow , or like we've just limited t with the , just ordinary phosphorescent so # PM: So we've decided on lighting up things . # UI: I was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the Real Reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised . # ID: Every time the , that it lit up , you c that could light up as well . # ID: Or , or the , whate # PM: But with the same thing , I mean . If you touch the button and then it could be , it could be lit up as well . # PM: Are you okay with that ? # PM: So I think that completes most of our more practical decisions . # PM: And now it's up to designing . # PM: And making sure that this can be feasible . # PM: And do you have anything Do you have anything to say ? # ME: well , I was just gonna throw out there the thought about personalising the remote control . # ME: , it , you , 'cause you mentioned face plates . # ME: So I dunno if there's something that diff , you know like five different face plates . # ME: I dunno if this will start making it more complicated , but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote . # ID: Like you can have changeable mobile covers or something . # UI: Interchangeable thing ? # PM: Like an iPod or something ? # UI: That would be good . # ME: Exactly , like an iPod . # ME: Or , or like mobile ph . # PM: Like a cellphone ? . # ME: And I dunno if we'd want to go with like T_V_ show themes or something . # ME: Like a Bart Simpson faceplate . # UI: and then that would be more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well . # UI: Y Could buy extra # PM: Accessories . # ME: You could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on . # ID: Person . Well , that's great . # UI: That's a good idea . # PM: I think that we should incorporate that . # ID: Interchangeable . # PM: 'Cause that wouldn't be very expensive at all . # PM: You'd just get one mould , throw some plastic in it , you know . # ID: Interchan And also possible I mean , we could gain out of that by advertising certain T_V_ shows , or # PM: Well , that might be com problematic with copyright issues . # PM: So , if it takes off then we'll , we'll , we'll try that out . # ID: But if we , there is We could , the environmental factor , we didn't bring that up again . # PM: We'll have to do more research . # PM: Like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , the way it'll look . # PM: , does it need to be reached a de Do we need to reach a decision on that right now ? # PM: Because we need to investigate the financial implications . # PM: Does it need to be decided on now ? # ID: I think we could probably leave that 'til later on , then . # PM: Alright then . # PM: Anyone else have anything more to say before we close ? # PM: Alright , well . # PM: Let's have lunch and we'll discuss this later .
# PM: Is everyone ready to start ? # PM: Well , welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . # PM: I'll just get the PowerPoint presentation up and running . # PM: on the agenda for this , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with some general ideas of our design . # PM: And , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what materials we're gonna use , and that sort of thing . # PM: The meeting will be forty minutes long . # PM: And we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter . # PM: Alright , and I will switch up PowerPoint . # ID: Should be just loading . # ID: although I can't see it on my screen . # ID: That says go here . # ID: I've been doing some research into the different components that we could use , what's available to us f to actually make the remote control . # ID: , first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made , and what is it happens inside the casing , which is more your field . # ID: , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source . # ID: Which is not necessarily a battery , as we're about to see . # ID: , there are several components of , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of . # ID: , including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip . # ID: Which is where all the main information is contained . # ID: , diodes , transistors , resonators , resistors , and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well . # ID: , and all their positioning in the circuit . # PM: Are they all included , like mandatorily , or r are these different options ? # ID: they're all different options , they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced . # ID: We can go into that later . # ID: , all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately , and work out the most , like , effective circuit , including all the wires and everything like that . # ID: And the L_E_D_ of course , that's a light emitting diode . # ID: So , we could , so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well . # ID: Okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source . # ID: We could use a basic battery , but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as well . # ID: And they're not so great to dispose of , environmentally . # ID: There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . # ID: A bit out of date . # ID: Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed . # PM: What is a hand-powered dynamo ? # ID: , where you manually charge up the power . # PM: Just every , every once in a while ? # ID: Like you wind up something . # PM: Just every once in a while or constantly ? # ID: . Every once in a while I think # PM: It'd be kind of strange to always be cranking it I think . # ID: But it's It would be like going a step back in time . # ID: I don't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology . # ID: Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power . # ID: I mean , the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work . # ID: , or there's solar power , which we've been considering inside a building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite so useful . # ID: But , good to look into , renewable energy , always the way . # ID: , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat . # ID: That's got a lot to do with the ergonomics . # ID: Like how it's comfortable and s sits in the hand . # ID: We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up . # ID: I know I've had a remote control before which you couldn't tell which was the front and the back , 'cause it had so many buttons on , and the shape was so symmetrical that I'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button . # ID: Because you can't really see which way round it is . # ID: , we also can choose what materials we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more ideal for the anti-R_S_I_ . # ID: It's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that , so it's very like soft , not so stressful on your hands . # ID: , again , stepping back in time again there . # ID: I don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here . # ID: , titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really . # ID: But , would've been maybe for future projects . # ID: right our choice for buttons as well . # ID: We've developed some we've got some good advances in technology , with our research team have found some new multiple option scroll buttons . # ID: I think that was brought up for , they're basically quite a flexible design , modern , you don't have to use individual buttons . # ID: You can just slide up and down . # ID: I'm sure we're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads . # PM: one thing with the scroll buttons though . # PM: we would have to have an L_C_D_ # PM: display , and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult . # ID: And that would lead to an advanced If we have We're going on to that later with the advanc with the L_C_D_ that means we'd need a really advanced chip . # ID: And it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget . # ID: , also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with . # ID: It's the most straightforward . # ID: But you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well . # ID: Got decisions to make there . # ID: And this is what I was just saying before . # ID: Linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs . # ID: simple would go with the pushbutton . # ID: , regular you could link with the scroll button . # ID: And the advanced we'd have to go with a L_C_D_ s display . # ID: My personal preferences ? # ID: I think we could go for the kinetic energy source . # ID: I think that's quite an advanced kind of technology . # ID: It's not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor , attractive as well . # ID: And also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy , you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels . # ID: You just give it a shake . # ID: Sounds brilliant to me . # ID: Rubber casing I thing would probably the best , if we're going for the anti-R_S_I_ and like more choice with aesthetics . # ID: Like it could be pretty much any colour we want . # ID: , and gives you , more flexibility there . # ID: And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , then we could possibly have the scroll and the push , but no L_C_D_ , 'cause we probably can't afford that one . # PM: , one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as like as the exterior . # PM: This is the one thing that's protecting its innards . # ID: I think that would , there would be an in sort of more internal casing . # ID: And the rubber would just be the , what's in contact with the human . # PM: Another thing is it might be more difficult if it's a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates . # PM: I don't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there . # PM: Like if it was sort of like a clip-on plastic plate . # PM: It would work that way . # ID: Maybe if the , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case . # ID: So , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable . # UI: Like plastic with rubber , kind of on top # ID: I can't think of what . # UI: Well , there's , there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing , # UI: b like a Nokia it is . # ID: you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something , that's just it's protective as well . # ME: Like the skin ? # ID: It , it stops it , I mean , it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something , as well , 'cause it wouldn't damage itself so easily . # ID: I think i maybe a mixture of both there , maybe . # ME: So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber . # ME: And the buttons obviously are rubber . # PM: That sounds good . # PM: is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber ? # ID: As far as I know . It should be . # PM: we'll just say . # PM: Yes , just why not . # PM: I like the kinetic energy source idea . # PM: , I don't know when people will , be moving a remote around a lot . # ID: I thought that was # PM: But I think that it's worth it , kinetety , kinetic energy source . # PM: It could make an we could have any kind of style . # PM: It wouldn't be as heavy or bulky , Just for environmental reasons . # ME: I guess it's a bit scary 'cause it hasn't been done before . # ME: So it seems we'd have to do more research on it . # ME: Or I dunno if you could have a battery pack . # ID: Like as a backup for something . # ME: so there's there is a one battery , because most remotes use two batteries I believe . # ME: So , if it was running off of one battery as a # UI: That would be good . # ID: Some alternative just in case something went wrong . # UI: Maybe we could you were saying about solar power ma maybe not working indoors , but a lot of calculators , have solar power . # ID: I just thought of that . # UI: So maybe that could be incorporated as # ID: May maybe that could be the backup . # ID: Instead of a battery . # ID: Like solar backup . # ME: Although it needs some light , doesn't it ? # PM: , you can watch a T_V_ in the dark then . # UI: Do , do those calculators # ME: So , if we're doing If we're # ID: But thing is , it's not you don't need the solar all the time . # UI: I don't know how it works . # ID: It can be stored . # ID: It can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it . # ID: It just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day . # ID: Like a few hours a day . # PM: I think that might be a little impractical though . # ME: I think sometimes it's just shoved under , under a cushion , # ID: It could easily # PM: Like people don't wanna have to worry about that . # ID: I suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think , oh no , I forgot to charge my remote today . # ID: Like if the kinetic thing , I think what's best about that is that it's instant energy . # ID: You don't have to , you know , you can shake it a few times , or whatever . # PM: Or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it . # ID: Instead of you don't have to like make sure it's in the right place to charge and . # PM: Alright . Cool . # PM: 'S that the end of your presentation . # UI: It's not on my screen . # ID: it wasn't on mine either . # ID: I don't know why . # ID: I think , I just , I just used the mouse on there . # UI: You don't know why ? # UI: Is it that one ? # UI: , I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now . # UI: , first of all I'll explain what a user interface is . # UI: It's the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived , for example , heard or felt maybe , or by the human user . # UI: And it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data . # UI: , there are two types of user interfaces . # UI: There's the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device , for example a mouse for input control . # UI: So that's sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about . # UI: I'm not really sure about the pictures that maybe that's on an L_C_D_ screen . # UI: Or maybe it's the buttons or pictures or something . # UI: Do you think it's # ID: So I suppose sometime # PM: , because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard , so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard . # PM: You're pressing the numbers for , for what you want . # UI: So you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics . # ID: I s I suppose where mm on some buttons you would have like the power would be s some kind of symbol . # UI: Like an L_C_D_ screen . # ID: And if you wanted to go onto teletext or , I know we're not having that , but I mean a similar thing , you , they have there's a like little picture with a screen with lines across it , which I suppose it's that sort of thing like the , the symbol on the button . # ID: But if we're having a simplified display anyway , w that , we probably won't have to focus so much on that . # PM: we'll be doing # ID: It'll be more the on the numbers and the volume . # PM: It'd be more a command interface , and then # ID: I suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume , display , and stuff like that . # ME: So it's just draf graphical for the pointing aspect ? # ME: The infrared is like , that's considered a # UI: No I think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that's on the buttons of the remote control , and per # ME: So when it says pointing device that doesn't include # UI: Well it could be a wee scroller thing , and something could come up on the screen . # PM: I think they're talking about L_C_D_ type things . # UI: I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway , to make it more simplistic . # UI: But the , we could incorporate some of the graphical user points , just to make it m nicer to look at maybe . # PM: What do you mean ? # UI: I can't think of an example , Sort of like little pictures rather than # PM: like how the buttons # UI: Like a little sound . # UI: Instead of saying volume , like a little speaker or something . # PM: , as a button though . # PM: So , it's a keyboard in the shape of it , # UI: m perha . Maybe . # PM: I like that idea . # UI: we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control . # UI: As it would be less complicated , and the controls would be more user-friendly . # UI: , the remote control would be cheaper to design , so that we'd have more money in the budget to , target the design area of the interface . # UI: You know , make it more trendy and original . # UI: We'll have more money if we keep it simple . # PM: I'm sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget . # PM: A bit more too , . # UI: Seeing as it's quite a new technology . # UI: We , we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our , more user-friendly remote control , that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons , that their functions , colours and forms aren't always helpful . # ID: That's in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things . # ID: It can be a bit , overwhelming . # UI: And that all interfaces are different . # UI: that doesn't improve the use of the produ product , so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand . # UI: And maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use . # UI: Does anyone have any questions ? # PM: Do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it a simplistic look . # ME: I think if we go with the design plate thing , we'll have to . # ME: Just because of colour clashing , and if we wanted to , and we might , I mean , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons . # PM: But what about the lighting up effect ? # ME: You mean different colours for the lighting or # PM: , well , I thought we had decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up . # PM: And so if they were black , it wouldn't be possible for them to light up . # ME: Oh I see what you're saying . # PM: If they were white they would glow , probably . # PM: If they were made out of rubber . # ME: Oh so you're picturing the light is coming from the back . # ME: I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards . # ME: But , but I guess , you mean from the back . # PM: Where would the light come from ? # ID: I'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through . # ID: So there would have to , have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons , or something . # PM: and well rubber is a more translucent product too , so we have that taken care of . # ID: It should be able to # UI: In the phone that I was thinking of as well , when you change the covers of it , the , the little buttons that actually , you know , that contro control stuff , are behind the rubber . # UI: So you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces . # UI: Do you know what I mean ? # UI: 'Cause it's just the wee control , # ME: They , they insert over . # UI: thing that's behind it . # UI: I mean , we don't have to decide on one colour . # UI: Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe ? # PM: Well , if they're raised up buttons . # PM: So that you can feel them . # PM: We were talking about it being more , a lot more tangible . # PM: , it might be more difficult to do . # PM: If they're , if they're sticking up . # PM: If it's flat then , like o like on a cellphone or a mobile phone , it's like all very flat , and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons , but # ID: I think it would be possible . # ID: I don't think it would make that much difference . # ID: I mean , the dimensions of it . # ID: 'Cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone . You can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons . # ID: And then you get to the circuit . # ID: I don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing . # ID: I'm sure you could f work it out to fit in the casing , without causing too much difficulty . # ID: I'm sure that'd be fine . # PM: If it's do-able we can do . # PM: , sounds good to me . # UI: So that's everything , then ? # PM: Alright , thank you . # ME: Okay is that my turn then ? # PM: That means you're up . # ME: I have a shorter report for you today . # ME: it took a while to get this , # ID: You're not plugged in yet . # ME: That's a very good point . # ME: Okay , so , this report is about trend-watching . # ME: , basically so we can live up to our , our purpose of having a very fashionable remote control . # ME: just so you know , my method was mainly web web-based research this time around . # ME: I also spoke with fashion experts in Milan , New York and Paris . # ME: And I looked at the design reports from previous years , here at Real Remote . # ME: , just so c we can work off of them , see how fashions have changed . # ME: , so I'll list the three most important aspects that I've come across . # ME: , and they , they're each more important than the one that comes after it . # ME: , the first one is that there should be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look-and-feel . # ME: , this should be our priority , as we've been saying . # ME: The second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative . # ME: So , I think we've done a lot of talking about that , just with lighting and the buttons and the face-plates . # ME: , so it looks like we'll be able to keep on track with that . # ME: And the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use . # ME: So , pretty basic there . # ME: And the recent fashion update , according to fashion-watchers in Paris and Milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . # ME: , also , in contra in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy . # ME: Again , we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons . # ME: So , my personal preferences here , of course , as we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting , and I'd like to stick to that . # ME: The fruits and vegetable themes , I don't know if that's going to work for us . # ME: It sounds something that you'd use on kitchenware . # ME: I don't know if we wanna do it on remotes . # ME: It could be one of the options . # ME: Maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen . # ME: , the temporary light-up idea , sounds like we're gonna stick to that . # ME: And then , tying in a trendy look with user-friendliness . # PM: , it's the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring . # PM: Everything else we can really , we can really # ID: It is strange . # PM: , do , according to our plans already , given the market . # PM: But fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control . # ME: It's , it's a little but it , it's everywhere . # ME: So maybe we I've seen a lot of purses with olives on them , you know . # ME: But I think , I think if we stick to T_V_ based , you know , maybe T_V_ shows , or # PM: But they still need to fit into people's decor though . # ME: Or colour schemes . # ID: I think we possibly could take a more abstract design . # ID: Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables . # ID: And then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes . # ID: I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something . # ID: Or a strawberry seed or a leaf . # ME: The essence of strawberry . # ID: Or just like you know really make it a quite abstract , if that's fits in more with what we're doing . # ID: Instead of fruits and vegetables , just if you look at it straightforward , it's a bit It doesn't s quite fit in with the trendy well , obviously it does , if that's the current theme . # ID: But may maybe we could go more directly , I don't know . # ID: But initially , I dunno . # ID: I think if we just sort of tone it down a bit . # ID: and like not , not # PM: like more like photos of fruit , on , on our product . # UI: Or banana-shaped . # ME: One thing I was thinking though is I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals . # ME: So maybe there could be animal-based , you know . # ME: Because a lot of people have a house cat . Or , or a dog . # ME: , that might be getting , you know , too specific , and we should see what the success of the first face-plates are . # ME: But it's something to keep in mind . # ME: And , did you have any questions ? # ME: Pretty straightforward ? # PM: Alright , given that information , we need to start making some more specific decisions . # PM: So I'll need to hook up the PowerPoint again . # ME: Have you guys been saving your PowerPoint presentations to the # ID: I didn't for the first one . # ID: But I have now . # PM: But it's still around right ? # UI: Where do you have to save it to ? # ID: Project documents I think . # PM: I'm just trying to make this pop up now . # PM: Okay so we have to decide now exactly what we are going to do . # PM: So energy , we I can't write it in when it's in this setting . # PM: Does anyone know how to take it out of # UI: Just escape I think . # ME: The PowerPoint ? # PM: , so back to decisions . # PM: Energy , we've decided on kinetic , right ? # PM: Okay , so that's good . # ID: Are we going to have a backup ? # PM: But would a backup really be necessary ? # PM: I mean will people just use the battery if there's no , if there's , # ID: I think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy , # PM: if there is backup . # ID: be bold and innovative , and hope this works , and well hope that it works . # PM: There's like no reason why it wouldn't work , right ? # ID: I think I , I think we should just like take advantage of like using this to its full potential . # PM: It could even be one of our selling points . # ID: It could be fully kinetic energy . # PM: Environmentally conscious or something . # ID: Is everyone happy with that ? # ME: So if it's not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it ? # PM: Alright , the next decision is chip on print . # PM: I don't exactly know what that means . # ID: , it was whether we went for the simple , the regular , or the advanced chip . # ID: And that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have , # PM: and we were going for more simplistic style , right ? # ID: so that was without the L_C_D_ . # ID: So that means we're not doing the advanced . # ID: So it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons . # PM: I think we decided on the pushbuttons , right ? # ID: , so that's the simple . # PM: Would we need a more advanced one for the lighting , the interior lighting system ? # ID: So , it's probably gonna be the regular chip that we're going to need . # ID: So it's a medium . # PM: That's called medium , or regular ? # ID: So regular chip . # ID: Regular chip . # ME: is regular not simple ? # UI: It's for the lighting , . # ID: because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well . # PM: , does this , is this dependent on shape , or what it's made of , or what ? # ID: I think this is just like gonna be the a very outer case , which we will decide on rubber . # PM: Well , I guess plastic and coated in rubber . # PM: Plastic with rubber # ID: Plastic rubber coat . # UI: plastic coat . # PM: coating and interchangeable # ID: Interchangeable , . # ID: Still going for that . # PM: , interchangeable plates . # PM: User interface concept . # PM: This is your time to shine . # UI: We decided on the component . # UI: I , I I'm sorry , I've lost my PowerPoint thing , so I can't remember what it's ca it's the component # ME: Think it was called command interface . # ME: Command interface , . # UI: The command inter # PM: Command interface . # UI: The command line interface . # PM: Did you say command line ? # PM: Line interface . # PM: Alright , and supplements . # PM: What's that all about ? # UI: I think that is well we haven't really made any decisions about what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the in consistent use . # UI: Like what are ideas to combat these problems ? # UI: You know how different interfaces are very different , and can be confusing because of their difference , and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have . # UI: We haven't really decided what to do about that . # PM: , what are our choices here ? # UI: Well it's just w where shall we locate the buttons . # UI: What kind of functions wi shall we have ? # PM: You mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels , and we'll have the channel-changer , and volume , and power ? # UI: So pretty just the basic button functions . # PM: Like I don't know if we should go into like adjusting light levels , things like that , because different televisions will have # ID: Tone , contrast , and things . # ME: That was on , one of my presentations . # ME: About how often it was used . # ID: , it was minima # ME: Do you remember that ? # ID: well , it wasn't the l # PM: , it was hardly ever used really . # ME: Should I bring it up ? # PM: And most televisions will come with a remote . # ID: That would be good . # ID: and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television , # UI: , each television . # PM: well we know we want numbers . # ME: The ch t Screen settings was used zero point five times an hour . # ME: So tw twice every once every two hours . # ME: , and it was considered a one point five relevance , on a scale of ten . # ME: That's brightness , colour , tone , all that . # ID: I think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself , # UI: You don't change that often , . # ID: I'm sure it has its own buttons , so you don't necessarily need to have it on remote . # PM: and different televisions . # PM: Like we , I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of changes like that . # ID: So we're just going for power , channels , volume , # ME: The other one was audio settings . # ME: Mono , stereo , pitch . # ME: I mean I sometimes use that . # ME: Some T_V_s will have the option of like living room style , movie style , and that , they say that's used zero point eight times an hour , which is actually somewhat high . # ME: Like almost once an hour . # ME: , relevance of two . # PM: We have five minutes to finish our meeting . # PM: let's do this fast . # ME: Well that didn't some up on mine . # PM: Should we have audio ? # PM: It only comes up on mine usually . # UI: it would seem silly if we'd having anything else , just have an audio button though . # PM: I don't , I it's , it's a problem with the international appeal , I think . , if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work . # PM: But we know that everyone has this and it's the same . # ME: I guess that it affects the marketing , 'cause it , mm it is a good sales ploy to say , aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons . # ME: This one has channel , volume and your channe and your power . # ID: We can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic . # UI: That could be a sales pitch . # PM: And , okay , in closing , 'cause we only have five minutes . # PM: We'll be meeting again in thirty minutes . # PM: , you'll be working , Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design . # PM: Wait a minute . # PM: Is that right ? # PM: and the user interface design , so this is where the trendy stuff comes in . # PM: And you'll be evaluating the product . # PM: Poppy and Tara will have to work together , using modelling clay . # PM: And , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen . # PM: So , anyone else have something to say ? # ID: , I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect . # ID: seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research , I thi I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something , because even if that may not seem obvious to us , if that's what the surveys brought out , I think that we should probably go along with that . # ID: , so I suppose that'll come out in our dev design development . # ID: But you're happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg ? # ME: Now do you guys need want an idea of how many are you gonna come up with casing ideas ? # ME: Like f five different # UI: What I was thinking what do yous think of this ? # UI: , having the numbers kind of like , not a bunch of grapes , but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle . # UI: Like that's kind of fruity or something . # ME: you can have some fun with the buttons , it's true . # ID: We can have a look at those ideas , . # ME: I guess what you i ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well . # ME: So it's a something that will , you know , appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds . # ME: Something that your granny would want on her remote control . # ME: , and international tastes as well , so # ID: A lot of things to consider . Hm . # PM: Lots of Alright . # PM: 'Kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then . # PM: And , we'll reconvene in thirty minutes . # PM: I'll see you later . # PM: Oh , what did I just do .
# PM: Alright , the agenda for thi Alright . # PM: the agenda for this meeting is we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . # PM: And then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that we gave it . # PM: And talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . # PM: I have a spreadsheet where we can calculate our prices for every aspect of what we've made , given our options . # PM: And evaluate the product , as a group . # PM: So first we'll have the prototype presentation . # PM: Do you need the PowerPoint for this ? # ID: I just got a few slides , so show them . # ID: Do you want to present it ? # UI: This is what we came up with . # UI: It's a pretty simple design . # UI: It's based on a mango ? # UI: And we have the company logo here and this will be the infrared here # UI: and this'll be the power point , the on off button kind # ME: What was the where's the L_E_D_ ? # UI: It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . # UI: And then the other one is the power . # UI: And we just have a simple design . # UI: We wanted it all to be # ID: So it's palm-held . # UI: accessible from your thumb palm-held and all the buttons are accessible from your thumb . # PM: Notice you have a number ten button . # UI: So you don't have to Oh that was a mistake , wasn't it ? # ID: You just need the nought . # UI: Right no , that's a zero . # UI: Take that one off . # UI: I was in charge of the numbers . # UI: And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus . # ID: So one plus one would be eleven , # UI: You can go one , three or something . # PM: You press a plus button ? # UI: You press that first and then you go one three # PM: I've never heard of that kind before . # UI: Well we just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and # ID: because if you on your average remote , if you press one twice you just go to or say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve . # ID: So if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two . # UI: So the plus and then # PM: Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ? # UI: that's why we have all these numbers . # UI: These numbers these numbers all work independently up to nine . # PM: but I mean if you press , it'll go to that channel right away . # PM: 'Cause you gotta press the plus afterwards . # UI: , the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine . # PM: but if I wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if I press the six it'll go to channel six , and then I'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ? # UI: No you press the plus first . # UI: I well it doesn't we haven't really s I would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five , but she says plus press which # ID: Well I don't mind , we can further define that . # UI: what do you think is simpler ? # ID: I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five . # PM: it wouldn't be a problem . # PM: But I was just wondering # ID: But I suppose it's not as snappy . # PM: like as long as we realise that's what it'll do . # ME: Well the there is a there's a delay on remotes I think . # ME: Where you can have it it's like a five second input time . # ID: If you don't put it # ME: So as long as you hit them dada it should be fine . # ME: As long as there's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons . # ME: Was there so on the top there is volume and # ID: which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it , like # ME: Channel up volume up . # UI: Just so we can flick # PM: where where's the power button ? # UI: It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . # ID: It's the bigger R_ . # ID: So it's just like . # UI: so it's all accessible . Without m taking your hand off the remote . # ID: We deci we went for like a circular design for the numbers because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb . # ID: e ergonomics are all considered . # PM: Ergonomic , definitely ergonomic . # UI: And it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well . # ID: It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though . # ID: , no I mean it's a different movement and the feel of it , I mean , we've made this out of Play Doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness . # ID: 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti-R_S_I_ material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it , and it just feels different . # PM: Bit of a stress ball feel . # ID: Would you like to feel it yourselves ? # ID: How it fits in the palm of your hand ? # ME: Oh I think I killed the five . # PM: And something . # ME: I killed the four . # ID: Okay , as for the colours , we were presented with a limited range of colours for this prototype . # ME: Oh it smells good . # ID: But we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . # ID: Or the combination . # ID: and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , # ID: or vanilla might be the most popular if it just blends in # UI: 'Cause it'd be quite subtle and # ID: more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish . # PM: It looks more Think like vanilla and banana would . # ID: Banana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company the yellow and black . # ID: So that for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength . # ID: I mean watermelon , you know , m probably appealing to the # PM: Kinda Christmas , you know . # ID: Apple green , brown , more kinda trendy , you know , khaki # UI: The pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of , and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor . # ID: we thought of the components it was definitely a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device , I mean you don't need to use both hands , one hand to hold this and type in with the other , you can just use your thumb . # ID: , as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-R_S_I_ and that's about it . # PM: Alright , thank you very much . # PM: Good work everyone . # PM: And so now that we've we have a prototype , we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches what our budget can handle . # PM: So , I have something I'm going to Oh wait a minute . # PM: Do you need to do a presentation first ? # ME: I don't know what order it goes in . # PM: I'm gonna check that out for a second . # PM: What time is it anyw you're right . # PM: Evaluation criteria is next in line . # ME: Evaluation cri Okay . # ME: Oh there we go . # ME: Come on my computer . Come on . # ME: my computer's giving me technical difficulties . # PM: Just press function eight again . # ME: Should I press it again ? # ME: Last time I did that it sh Okay . You're right . # PM: And then again I think . # PM: One more time . # ME: Still not there . # ME: Okay now I think for this one I could Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe I'll just do it on right on the screen where you can see it . # ME: , we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen . # ME: and looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings , I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were , back to our kick-off meeting this morning . # ME: , and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do . # ME: and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false . # ME: So basically the lower p the lower the points the better . # ME: Okay so question number one . # ME: Does the remote whoops . # ME: Oh I'm not gonna be able , I'll do it on the whiteboard . # ME: I can't change it so I'm g I'm gonna ask you to push it down once . # ME: I'll write down our scores up on the Okay so number one . # ME: Do we have a fancy look-and-feel ? # ID: We've been quite successful with the rubber coating # PM: The look is a little bit more playful . # ME: I guess that depends on your definition of fancy , but it's definitely different . # PM: Oh definitely different . # ME: It's not your traditional # ID: I think the colour has a lot to do with it . # ID: I mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen . # ID: It's not the kind of ooh at all sleek # PM: Oh you were only given red and black ? # ID: red , black and yellow , and orange . # UI: not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey . # UI: So we want it to be stand out that way , anyway . # ID: But if you can imagine that in like a s just a maybe a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something # UI: A metallic-y finish we were thinking . # ID: Well I know it's for rubber . # ID: I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy . # ME: I kinda I like the potato look . # ID: Oh well , potato , mango , fruit and veg . # UI: We we were we were thinking about # ME: It's very different . # ME: Oh sorry the mango the mango look . # ID: Potato's fine . Potato's fine . # ME: it is , fruit or vegetable depends on your mood . # ID: It's really adaptable . # ME: So I myself would say a one or a two . # PM: I would say two . Personally . # UI: I w I'd say two I think . # ME: One being true . # ME: actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing , like that . # ME: Okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative ? # ME: So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative . # ID: and the use of the rubber . # ME: Use of the rubber , the use of the L_E_D_ . # ID: For the anti-R_S_I_ . # ID: The L_E_D_ use isn't particularly innovative and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons , there's no L_C_D_ control , so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's sort of probably halfway . # ID: In some aspects it is , like we said . # PM: I'd say maybe three . # UI: I'll go for three as well . # ME: And I think I mean it it's tough to say because we were we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose . # PM: we want it simple . # ID: Though it was our specification . # UI: No . Wouldn't be simple , . # ME: So I mean I we'll put three , but I think we actually reached our goal . # ME: We didn't want it any more than that . # ME: Okay question number three . # ME: , will it be easy to use ? # UI: I think one for that . # ME: I think it's you can't really get confused with that . # ME: I mean , there'll be s we have to work out the number the plus system . # PM: The plus number thing . # UI: that's the only thing . # ME: But once that's figured out , it should be fine . # ID: and perhaps the turning on # ME: Is this a good-looking remote ? # ME: Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . # UI: It's definitely # ID: Again I think the colour comes into this . # PM: colour will definitely be a factor . # PM: I think that the logo could be smaller . # PM: And maybe not such a prominent way . # PM: Maybe like at the bottom , kind of . # UI: But the Remember the management said that it had to be prominent . # PM: Oh it just had to be on there I guess . # ME: Should just not touch it . # ME: This time it's the three I killed . # ME: I was just wondering if it should be like flatter . # ID: I suppose I've got quite big hands . # PM: I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand . # UI: But you know what I've just thought of there now . # UI: where's it gonna sit in your living room ? # UI: Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ? # PM: Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat , and then the rest is like # ME: the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit . # UI: But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand . # ME: Oh . That's true . # PM: It would still be comfortable I think . # PM: We c we could handle it I think . # ID: Thing is like that , it's not going anywhere particularly . # ME: Maybe , it could it could be on the bottom , so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here , so it sits up . # UI: Oh that would be nice . # PM: it'd fall over all the time though . # PM: It'd be annoying . # ID: it's less , what's th ha . # ME: If it's weighted maybe . # PM: 'Kay we're done designing . # ID: H it's got higher centre of gravity like that . # ME: Details , details . # ME: Okay . So , is this a good-looking remote ? # ME: Would we wanna show it off to our friends ? # UI: You would though , 'cause it's bit it's more interesting than other remotes . # PM: I think , it was another colour and it was like I think it'd look okay . # PM: I think maybe a two . # ID: I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , # ME: I mean I gue , it's personal taste , # ID: but definitely in another colour , I'm not happy with those colours . # ME: Okay , so should we say two for that ? # ME: , question number five . # ME: will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ? # ME: Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy . # UI: I think we have to market it in the right way , that to say that it is simplistic . # UI: So people don't just see it and think , this is so simplistic , I don't want to spend twenty five Euros . # UI: We have to market it . # ME: it the marketing will have a lot to do with it . # ID: And the kinetic energy , shaker-style-y , whoo , # UI: And the kinetic energy part . # ME: Shake it and the buttons fall off . # ID: But you know , those'll be firmly on . # UI: Don't shake Oh no the plus . # ME: No , I guess , I don't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for , # UI: Make a new one . # PM: But you're our Marketing Expert . # ME: I know I am , aren't I ? # UI: I think they're about ten po ten pound , aren't they ? # UI: About ten pounds . # ME: But you don't have to buy batteries . # ME: So in the long term this can actually save you money . # ID: Mm , that's true . # PM: Oh . Exactly . Exactly . # ME: So we'll market it that way too . # ME: So I think with a good marketing scheme and the personalisation options , it'll # PM: I would give it a two still though . # ME: Okay number six . # ME: Can someone read it out ? # ID: Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user . # ME: So that was mainly that the statistics # UI: I think it does very well . # ID: because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing . # ID: And it's just you won't have to think about it . # ID: You don't have to look down to find them . # ID: They're clearly there , easy to use . # ME: I guess the I think the key word there is average , 'cause there were some people that used the video input and sound and stuff . # ME: But they're not you and I really . # ME: Number seven . # ME: C Heather could you push it down ? # ME: Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ? # ME: Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly . # PM: We have the alarm system . # ME: Now is there the is the alarm system still was it implemented ? # UI: when you press the alarm system , the lights behind the and it'll vibra # ID: l lights on and , or flash as well . # ID: But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm . # UI: It'll be again in the marketing . # PM: I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up . # UI: The light it will . # PM: Or or was it gonna make a noise ? # ID: But when the alarm's not # PM: You press the button it makes a noise # ME: It turns into a duck and starts quacking . # PM: Awesome . Awesome . # UI: Oh , that would be brilliant . # UI: I'd be tempted to # ID: Well the thing is , if it was had an alarm system , I mean , when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went . # ID: But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there wouldn't be any point . # ID: So you can't see the alarm , but it would light up . # UI: It would have to be in the market # PM: I though w it was gonna make a noise . # UI: but you still couldn't see it . # ID: but you can't see an alarm inside the alarm system itself . # UI: It would just be a little speaker on the back or something . # ME: oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype . # ME: But , it'll be there . # ME: So we can we could say that # ME: We can give it a one , because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find . # ID: Sorry Heather . # PM: No problem , mm . # ID: That wasn't very clear . # ME: Question number eight . # ME: Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? # ME: Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult . # ME: So it has to be it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do . # UI: So the plu the plus w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple , # ME: The plus thing needs to be worked on . # ID: I think just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use . # ME: Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button ? # ME: So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least . # PM: so it's just like channel six , six , enter . # UI: That kind of annoys me though , when it's zero six when you have to press # PM: but you don't have to press zeros . # UI: I don't know why . # ME: You could just press six enter , # UI: Oh okay . Right . # PM: And then like twelve , enter . # ID: And or sixty six enter , y # ME: or one two enter . # ID: I think that's probably more straightforward . # ME: , okay so we can # ME: we'll say yes it's one ? # ME: Question number nine . # ME: , will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_ , which was repeated strain injury ? # ME: , which affected over a quarter of users . # PM: It's like right in the # UI: But if you're zapping # PM: Your thumb might get a little bit # ID: , that's what I was thinking . # UI: I don't think it will f # ID: We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about . # PM: But it is soft . # PM: And that's kind of what the PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for R_S_I_ , # ME: And people could # PM: so maybe it is but # ME: I don't know what other options there are . # ID: I think we're getting that's true . # ME: I mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger . # ME: But there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard . # ME: So , I think we did as much as you can with a remote control . # ME: So , one or two do you think ? # ME: Okay number ten . # ME: Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ? # ME: Now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla ? # UI: N We we can't really do that # ME: Is the yellow # UI: because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow . # UI: It won't stand out . # UI: So n it's not always gonna be the same colour . # ME: It sounds like the colour's something that we # PM: Well , the colours are yellow and grey . # PM: So it could be grey on the banana one . # UI: , could be grey . # ME: But I mean the yell d yellow's ugly though , # ME: depending on the # UI: we didn't even rea # ME: So I think we'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the R_R_ . # ID: I think this is the factor that we've been least successful in confronting . # UI: Perhaps a metallic like that's grey , and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal . # UI: That isn't rubber . # ME: And the buttons in the middle . # ME: So , do you think that's more of a three then ? # ID: Well I don't what do what # ME: Well we have good reasons for it , so we but we can still put a and final question . # ME: , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ? # ME: Current trends of fruits and veggies , desire for sponginess . # PM: I would say so . # UI: Following that briefing we did . # PM: But maybe more like two 'cause there's no like pictures of fruit , it's just sort of naming it by a fruit . # PM: With the with the colours . # ID: Like the colour scheme names and stuff . # ME: No , are the plates interchangeable ? # ME: I think I missed a few they are ? # ME: So you can have banana and kiwi and Okay , so that's something that's kind of in the making too , like maybe it'll become more # PM: That's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates . # UI: I think I think one . # UI: Well that was our brief and we followed the brief . # ID: The thing is , I think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from , I don't know if you'd instantly say mango . # UI: Well we haven't got a big banana but # PM: Be like Maybe if it was scented . # UI: Oh that would be class . # ID: Oh . There we go . # ID: That would be great . # PM: we have money for that . # PM: Alright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ? # ME: So I wh what was I gonna put for that ? # ME: A two for fashion ? # PM: I would say two . # ME: Okay , so our average there , five , six , eight , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fifteen , nineteen , twenty one , divided by eleven # PM: One point nine or something ? # PM: I don't know these things . # PM: , between one and two . # ID: Between one and two . # ID: So that's pretty fantastic . # ME: , that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one . # ME: Does that seem right then ? # UI: , 'cause we've a four to bring down . # ID: It seems like it should be more around two . # UI: , should've added five . # ID: Do we have an online calculator ? # PM: I'm attempting to do that right now . # PM: it is one point nine . # ID: Oh wow . Well done . # PM: Go Heather Pauls . # ID: Well that's excellent . # PM: Alright , now with that over and done with , our next step is to see if we are under budget . # PM: And my computer's frozen . # PM: And now it's not . # PM: Okay . So in our shared folder , if everyone could go there right now , I'm going to steal a cable . # ME: Are you gonna do that ? # UI: Is that the project document ? # PM: it's an Excel file . # ID: Production costs . # PM: 'Kay there we go . # PM: , production costs . # PM: And I have to access that as well . # PM: 'Kay so far I've added what I think or what is going on ? # PM: It's blinking at me . # PM: It's locked for editing . # PM: I'm gonna open up a second one then 'cause it's locked for editing . # PM: I have the original in my email account . # ME: Oh is it locked 'cause I'm in it ? # ID: I think it just means that we can't add any more to it now . # ID: Have you have you completed it ? # PM: No , I was hoping that you guys could . # ID: Oh right . Okay . # PM: Okay here we go . # PM: So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing . # PM: So if you can look up at the screen , the large screen , oh I guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think . # PM: Okay we're using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three Euros . # PM: we're using a regular chip . # PM: , it's cur it's double curved , so its curved all around . # ID: Double double-curved . # PM: That's another three . # PM: We're already at five . # PM: , we're using plastic and rubber , Good thing plastic is free , we're at eight . # UI: What about a special colour ? # UI: Are we using that ? # PM: I guess we should do it just for one kind . # PM: So it's like special colour well we'll have two colours Well one colour for the case , one colour for the buttons . # PM: So we can , we have push button interface , so that's inexpensive . # PM: And we have a special colour for the button , and we also have a special form . # PM: And a special material . # UI: And a special material . # PM: Which puts us just barely under budget . # ID: Congratulations guys . # PM: Good work guys . # PM: So our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros . # PM: And back to our PowerPoint . # PM: So we've Yes we are . # PM: So we need to do a product evaluation , again , which is probably I dunno . # PM: A different extension of a # ID: Of the actual project rather than the product ? # PM: 'cause we're talking about leadership , teamwork . # ID: So wh how we actually went round about doing it . # PM: Alright so Do you guys feel like there was room for creativity ? # ID: I think we were pushed . # PM: Pushed for creativity ? # ID: I mean we weren't really given a lot of time , or materials , to go about our design task . # UI: Or materials . # ID: So I think we could've done with a bit more time . # PM: So it'd be like need more time and materials . # PM: But you were allowed m creativity ? # PM: I think so as like but you were supposed to have creativ # ME: and the conceptual and functional . # ME: Like we were very creative in coming up with an idea I guess , but m # ID: Well we were just limited by resources really and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we wouldn't have been able to afford that . # ME: When we can down to it . # ID: So that did limit creativity . # ID: Just resources . # ID: The fruit and veg idea . # PM: Is this me being like , guys do you like me ? . # ME: Good leadership , I think we stayed on task . # ID: seeing as we've come out with what we intended . # ID: A pro a product within the budget . # ID: I think that's a sign of good leadership and also our personal coach helped us along the way , so you know I think it's been fine . # ME: And the timing was good . # ME: We never were pushed for time , or sat around doing nothing , so # ID: And project manager of course . # PM: I think we worked great as a team . # ME: Was good teamwork . # ME: I think we are well-suited to our roles . # PM: Alright how were our means ? # PM: We needed more Play Doh colours . # ID: and more Play Doh , 'cause that was all the red we had . # ID: So even if we wanted to make a bigger prototype , we wouldn't have been able to . # UI: , it c it might've been bigger . # PM: But ever everything else was satisfactory ? # ME: The computer programmes are good . # ID: It could be really straightforward for the computer . # ID: I think the only thing was having to remember to you know to tick the okays # ME: I don't think there was anything # ID: but I think I was the only one who struggled with that . # UI: I'm actually not sure if I've saved my presentations . # ME: They'll probably still be there . # PM: New ideas found . # PM: I don't really know what that means . # ID: Well I think we've all learnt stuff from each other , like the n # UI: Through discussion . # ID: Just about each different . Got new ideas from each other . # ME: I'm not sure , new ideas found . # ME: well I guess we really it we bounced off of each other , which was cool . # ME: Like based on marketing stuff and then you'd say something about interface and , worked well . # UI: And we were a able to modify each other's ideas to fit in with our areas of expertise . # ME: Oh does it have smart materials by the way ? # ME: Does it have smart materials ? # ID: Well mm , did it come into the into # ID: I dunno if we counted that in the costs . # UI: If it can be afforded . # PM: Well with that achieved , our last slide is our closing slide . # PM: Yes our costs are within budget . # PM: It's evaluated generally positively . # PM: And don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . # PM: Then we celebrate # ME: By watching T_V_ ? # PM: in such a way that I have no idea . # ID: Okay , brilliant . # ID: Thank you very much . # ME: Conclusion ? Dadada .
# PM: Oh , that's not gonna work . # PM: I'll just put that there . # PM: as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote . # PM: I'm Nick Debusk , I'm the Project Manager . # PM: we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is . # ME: I am Corinne Whiting and I will be the Marketing Expert and in each of the three phases I will have a different role . # ME: In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and I'll be doing research to figure this out . # ME: In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching and I'll be doing marketing research on the web . # ME: And then finally in the detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation and so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did . # UI: I'm the User Interface Designer . # UI: likewise I've three different roles for each stage of design . # UI: the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control . # UI: in the concept design , the user interface , how the user reacts with the product . # UI: And the detailed design sort of like the user interface design , what they might be looking for , things like fashions , what makes wha how we're gonna make it special . # UI: That's about it . # ID: I'm Manuel and I'm the Industrial Designer in this project . # ID: In the functional design phase I'm I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements , we'll discuss what the prog what functions the product has to fulfil and so and so on . # ID: I suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one . # ID: in the conceptual design I'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials of our product . # ID: And the detailed design in the detailed design I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself , so we're pretty much working together obviously on the design front here . Okay . # PM: we've got our opening , our agenda is the opening , acquaintance which we've kinda done . tool training , project plan discussion and then closing . # PM: grand total of twenty five minutes we have here . # PM: we are putting together a new remote control . # PM: we want it to be something original . # PM: of course we're a not only a electronics company but a fashion conscious electronics company , so we want it to be trendy and we want it to be easy to use . # PM: we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design which basically is the three of you . # PM: And w well functional design . # PM: do we have any ideas of maybe d let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and how we're gonna do the detailing on it . # UI: function of remote control is just you know , change channels is its main function . # PM: we want it to be a T_V_ remote or I mean do we want it to do other things besides just be a television remote ? # UI: I suppose you c try make it a universal remote could work on all sort of electrical products in one person's house . # UI: But , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming . # UI: I think they all work on the same prin principle as well sorta like I don't actually know . # UI: But is it just infra-red ? # UI: Is that standard ? # PM: I think , r universal remote . # PM: this is my first go-round with creating a remote control , # PM: I think we're all in the same boat here . # UI: one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em . # UI: So if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily , I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature . # PM: So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a # ME: Like a tracking device ? # PM: like a tracking device or like a # UI: Oh you can get those key you could whistle or make a noise # PM: It makes a noise , # PM: there's a button on the T_V_ that you press # UI: Generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance . # PM: so they're kinda like long and rectangular . # PM: Do we want something crazy ? # UI: Black usually . # PM: You know , we want something new that's gonna stand out . # ME: Lot more modern . # PM: A m a modern so our remote should be # UI: Maybe sorta spherical or something . A ball . # ME: Maybe like user-friendly , like a little you know , where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing . # UI: People I thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another if it was in a ball , and maybe the actual controls are inside or something . # ID: there are of course certain restrictions , you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , so there are always the some restrictions we have to apply here . # ID: however one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , that refers to the material , pretty much . # ID: What are we gonna build that thing out of ? # ID: How sturdy is it gonna be ? # ID: Do we want it to last longer or rather have people whatever , have to buy one every half a year ? # PM: Okay so , so we want it to be sturdy , we want it to hold up to somebody's child , you know , throwing it across the room or , as you said , people kinda throw it , so ball-shaped , you know , if it were ball-shaped maybe , then it # UI: It could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside . # PM: we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy , So our form and our function . # PM: we want it to be easy to find . # PM: What else it what else do we want it to do ? # PM: So we want it to be universal . # PM: It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros and you know , goals for profits are I think somewhere around fifty million Euros , what they wanna make on it , so . # ME: Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association , maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal . # ME: That's more on the research end , but the marketing . # PM: So marketing , you know , how maybe marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally appealing remote control out there . # ME: And maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences , 'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting . # PM: Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ? # PM: Maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there . # PM: We want it to be a b a ball , # UI: I could draw sorta the ball idea . # PM: you know , we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball and maybe th where the buttons are located . # UI: My original idea was just simply sort of a sphere , where maybe you this is where it's connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , and then when you fold it out the middle Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it . # UI: If that if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts , and then you'd have just sorta you know , your buttons . # UI: Thing is inside I think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , so maybe as simple as possible , as few buttons inside as possible . # UI: , I dunno , what's the idea for . # UI: Just something maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it . # UI: It's looking a bit like something out of Star Wars at the moment though , to be fair . # UI: That was that was a sorta simple idea I had and then you know you could about it would almost be like a ball . # UI: So that was just an idea I had . # UI: I don't know whether anybody else has other ideas ? # ID: One problem you'd get with this design is the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really , but of course , since it's a ball , it'll roll , so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , # ID: take away that part . # ID: That's one of the big issues . # ID: Also also you risk the hinges here . That's that's a problem . # UI: , that's g that's a good idea . # UI: The idea it didn't have to necessarily be f a hinge , # ID: That's that's interesting of course , # UI: that was just one idea though . # ID: but that's of course a weak point , . # PM: How would we go about making you know getting rid of our weak points ? # PM: I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ? # PM: Not to put you on the spot , What did you say your title was again ? # PM: You're the Industrial Designer . # ID: , I'm your Industrial Designer , so i b well , the point is maybe I dunno . # ID: The shape is perhaps not the most ideal . # ID: As as stable as it is , there must be a compromise between stability and design here , so . # UI: I suppose that things become design . # UI: But I mean i I was trying to think of like the design of others . # UI: I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote , maybe small , sort of fatter ones , but there's nothing being done sort of out of left field , . # PM: It's not new , it's not innovative , you know , everybody does long remote because it's easy , it's stable . # ME: I'll draw something . # ME: My idea was just to have it be kind of like a keyboard type shape , you know , like video games But maybe I mean that would be kinda big and bulky . # ME: We could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way . # ME: That's my idea . # UI: I think definitely doing something different is a good idea . # UI: I mean maybe design something , that's sort of like suppose not everybody's hand's the same , but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier . # PM: Something with a grip . # PM: Because even I suppose even with the ball # UI: It still might be hard to it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , . # PM: it might not be the easiest to hold onto . # PM: So perhaps the joystick the keyboard idea might work better . # PM: But then again , people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda , so maybe we # UI: I think it's definitely got to be a one-handed a one-handed job . # PM: I feel like I'm just shooting everything down here . # ME: You're the boss , you're allowed to . # ID: with the one-handed design you also have the problem of the size 'cause you know from cell phones , they can be too small . # ID: So if the remote is too small it if it's small it probably looks better , may not be th as functional . # ID: So for that there's # PM: Okay , so unfortunately we've got about five minutes here to come up with our remote control idea and start rolling with it . # PM: we've talked about our experiences with remote control and we've got a couple ideas . # PM: Let's see here . # PM: What if we had what if we had not only say we went with the ball the ball function , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s to make it easier to hold on to . # PM: So you know s so it's easier to hold onto that way . # PM: Course that'll then remove some of our ball . Unless this unless this part were raised , say the cover flips over and covers that part . # PM: So the grip is No , that wouldn't work either . # PM: But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . # PM: So if it were flat on the bottom and then had the sorta grips on the side here I guess , and then flat And then we have the problem with the hinge . # PM: So if we're flat on the bottom , it's not gonna roll away , it'll stay where we want . # ID: The question is also , I dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ? # PM: Mm , that's true . # ID: It's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , so I don't know if a lid is a good idea . # ID: From stabil stability point of view it certainly is , but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , the more we sell . # ID: don't make it too stable . # PM: we don't have it flip open . # PM: We just have a ball # UI: But then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then . # ID: To the other design . # PM: so then we forget the ball . # ID: It looks cool . # ME: Looks cool though . # PM: It looks cool , but it's really not it's not functional . # PM: So we've got our sort of keyboard kind . # PM: What if we flipped it around here , so that it were that doesn't look anything like what you had there . # PM: it's up and down , you hold it this way . # PM: Course then it's like the rectangular again , only with a couple of jutting out points . # PM: But it's one-handed . # ID: Question is what makes those game pads functional ? # ID: I think that's pretty much the form for full hand . # ID: So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy , makes it nice , so that's the essential part . # ID: Except for that I think we'll not probably not get a get away from some longer design . # ID: 'Cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing . # PM: because it doesn't have a cord , like joysticks do . # ID: that dif batteries and Batteries go weak as well , after a while you have to point it towards the towards the equipment you wanna control with it , So , have to m show which is the front , which is the back . # PM: Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ? # PM: So that either way you're pointing it would work . # ID: I suppose you could do that . # ID: O of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so . # PM: More expensive and . # ID: Course you can do that . # ID: I mean of course it'll be evident after a while or if you look at it , it'll be evident which way around to point it , since you have the numbers and the and the buttons and stuff , but it's rather about an instinctual thing , like you just grab it , you don't have to s look at it , you know , which way around to point it . # ID: Otherwise the design of or the point of putting two sensors on both sides would probably work . # UI: Even if you designed it in some in a way that you know , isn't a rectangle , but still pointed in a direction that had definite points . # UI: So if that's your thing and you got something like that instead , and there's your s you kn you know which way you're gonna pointing it . # ME: Sorry to interrupt , but we have a warning to finish . # PM: Are we out of time ? # PM: Okay , well , just to finish up , should we s go with this plan , start making some Are good ideas , what are not . # UI: Does it say what does it say for n # UI: it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , I think . # PM: Must finish now , so . # PM: And then marketing will look and see what people want . # PM: And Project Manager will design a better meeting for next time around , be a little bit more prepared . # PM: And alright , good meeting .
# PM: Thanks for coming to this meeting . # PM: how we doing on our remote ? # PM: We have some we have some ideas and some ideas for what people want . # UI: we yes s I've lo I've done the role that I was asked to do anyway . # PM: Alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . # PM: See if I can't get things moving along here a little bit better . # PM: I'll go over what we went over last time , which shouldn't take long . # PM: Then I believe each of you have a presentation . # PM: I've was sent a couple more requirements for our remote , what they want . # PM: then we can come to a conclusion on what we want the remote to do , and how it's going to do it hopefully . # PM: And then we'll have the closing . # PM: which we'll have forty minutes for . # PM: let's see , the last meeting we went over who was responsible for what . # PM: I'm responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes , and coming up with the final presentation . # PM: Corinne is our Marketing Expert . # PM: She's gonna figure out what the consumer wants . # PM: Ryan is our User Interface Designer . # PM: And Manuel is the Industrial Designer . # PM: So you're gonna come up with the ideas Ryan , and you're gonna pick 'em apart . # PM: we decided our remote , we want it to be a universal remote that everyone would want . # PM: we want to be modern , fun , different . # PM: it needs to be sturdy , easy to find , so we gonna have that locator function . # PM: and we want to be different . # PM: and then we went over a couple of different ideas . Ball-shaped phone . The keyboard shape . # PM: we decided that it should probably be one-handed . Something we could use with one hand . # PM: and that was our last meeting . # PM: why don't Do each of you have a presentation ? # PM: I'll hand it off to you Does anyone do you wanna go first ? # PM: So we can maybe see what the people want . # ME: What was it ? Function ? # ID: Eight . F_ eight . # ME: How do I get it # PM: To go to the next one ? # PM: you click on that guy . # ME: Alright . Well , this is my report , which is going to be based pretty much on a survey that I was sent . # ME: Oh gosh , I've no idea . # UI: Just press the arrow keys I think . # UI: Usually goes to it . # ME: I actually need to see something else on my screen . # PM: Hit F_ eight again . # PM: You want it to be on both screens , or just yours ? # ME: I want something else on mine . # ME: Is that possible ? # PM: but I think you have to hit escape . # PM: And then you can # ME: but now you don't have that . # PM: hit F_ eight again . # PM: I did the same thing . # PM: And then it should come up here shortly . # ME: is there no way I can give you the slideshow and # PM: I think oh give us the slideshow and something on your screen ? # PM: You could maybe minimise that screen and then have them both up at the same time I think . # ME: Okay . so first of all , the method that I used was by doing some marketing research , by doing research on some interviews that were conducted . # ME: And then some internet research . # ME: And I was sent a report that was I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed . # ME: And so I will show you some of the results from that , which I think will be helpful . # ME: here are some of the findings . # ME: They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . # ME: And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . # ME: Which is a fairly significant number I would say . # ME: And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . # ME: So I think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look , I think that's definitely important . # ME: they say that current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . # ME: Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot . # ME: And if anyone could clarify what that means ? # UI: Is is it j just # ME: Zap , does that just mean like changing the channel ? # UI: just using it # ME: and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control . # ME: And there was something else , they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons . # ME: And some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all . # ME: Of course channel selection is used the most frequently . # ME: And then teletext was the next . Volume and then power . # ME: And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used . # ME: I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button . # ME: the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea . # ME: They said it take thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . # ME: And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for R_S_I_ . # UI: A repetitive strain injury . # UI: Just repetitive strain injury . # UI: I think . That's what I guess . # ME: And so bas as far as speech recognition goes , the younger group looks like they're all for it . # ME: From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more . # ME: And it kind of just went down incrementally . # ME: The groups at the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay , so maybe we could discuss this and think and decide if we think it's worth investing in this . At least if we're targeting the younger groups . # ME: in conclusion . Some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct . # ME: We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance , since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control . # ME: a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore . # ME: So you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room . # ME: we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons , get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose . # ME: And then lastly I thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition . # PM: Now we actually have some ideas of what people want , what we should focus on . # PM: can I look at that real quick ? . # ME: did you guys get time to write everything that you needed ? # UI: Having just listened to what Corinne just said , I'll draw on some of the things as well . Some things that sort of relevant to what I wanna say . # UI: I'm just gonna approach the technical functions design . # UI: the method I used was to explore the technical functions of a remote control . # UI: And t s simplest approach that I came to is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely . # UI: I mean that's an obvious thing to say , but it's not attached to the device that you want to control . # UI: I had some things sent to me . Not very much . # UI: To look at similar devices . # UI: defined in some them . # UI: And then the personal preferences that I will suggest . # UI: we discussed a universal one . # UI: it's just been brought up again then . # UI: But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it , because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . # UI: I'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself , but you have to i they're a nightmare to use . # UI: You have to set them , reset them to everything . # UI: and that would only add buttons . # UI: Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons . # UI: So I think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for T_V_s . # UI: or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people , manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications , if the aim is to get something that's unique in design . # UI: here here's just two pictures of remote controls . # UI: They're just simple T_V_ remote controls . # UI: But one is user-centred . # UI: That is the one on the left . # UI: And you can straight away see there's less buttons . # UI: And the other one is engineer-centred where that's more specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control which appeals more to the product that we want , and on what the have said and the market research and stuff probably looking at something that should be user-centred . # UI: Fewer buttons , simpler to use , and if ten percent is hidden away if ten percent is what's used , maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away . # UI: And the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across . # UI: and finally , sort I've sort of covered that , our product I think should be user interface orientated . # UI: Like I said to concentrate on T_V_ remote control , a universal remote might be too complex . # UI: and as what it , the major findings market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike . # UI: So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend . # PM: What was your last conclusion on that one ? Focus on # UI: On something on the image of it . # PM: the image of it . # UI: the actual design . # ID: Gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there . # ID: unfortunately the people who were supposed to do this little presentation for me obviously were too drunk to actually accomplish it , I'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board . # ID: This is the basic premise of a remote control . # ID: the basic function is to send messages to another system . # ID: so much is clear . # ID: An energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , that can compose messages . Often in the form of infrared bits . # ID: This is the most mostly used . # ID: there's also some sound systems but infrared is the better or the more used system . # ID: parts are cheaper as well . # ID: A user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages . # ID: This is where my people screwed up basically . # ID: So I'm going to explain that on the board rather . # ID: what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there . # ID: We'll start with an energy source . # ID: which is usually a battery Since it's not feasible to add a cable to that . # ID: This energy source of course is connected to the user interface itself . # ID: which can be buttons , whatever , which in fact controls a chip . # ID: This is the user interface and there we have the chip . # ID: the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp . # ID: That sends out the signal . # ID: Of course the signal differs accordingly . depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp . # ID: And Of course that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . # ID: The way you normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well , so that you know that it's working basically . # ID: You press something , you get a response . # ID: Which is also comparatively important on one of those devices . # ID: Now this , what we're talking about here , or what I think should be discussed are these two components mostly . # ID: The the energy source for one thing can be altered . # ID: What we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared , the sending device basically , the infrared lamp . # ID: We cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp . # ID: These two are components that we have to use , and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing . # ID: the lamp can be put onto the desi the device . # ID: It c it doesn't have to be there . # ID: This can be discussed as well . # ID: The user interface . That's something we can also discuss . # ID: as we've heard speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment . # ID: Speech recognition interface , we don't know that . # ID: Or if we just do the usual button thing . # ID: Or we have a touch pad or something like that that's something we can discuss . # ID: And of course the energy source . Batteries . Solar cells . # ID: Of course it's always a question whether these components are in fact available cheap enough , developed enough . # ID: But that's like I s I suppose rather up to marketing , and not to # ID: to the industrial design department . # PM: the more complex we make it of course , the more expensive # ID: Expensive it's gonna be get . # PM: But people have said that they would younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote . # PM: possibly it might be worth the investment . # UI: I think speech recognition was one of those things where they have to be really good for them to work . # UI: 'Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o if it's on your phone . # UI: And you need to sort of take into light languages and then different dialects I suppose as well . # PM: I myself I find , when you , h when there's something like spee speech recognition . # PM: Like you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something . Sometimes they have a speech recognition on the other end , and you say one for this , and you find yours , like you said , saying the same thing over and over and over . # PM: I find myself , especially if I'm in a crowd of people , looking really silly . # PM: maybe if you're sitting on your couch with a bunch of people then you know , # UI: And wou I don't know if would you want to keep saying stuff if you were watching stuff . # UI: If you were watching something would you sort of be wanting # PM: Volume up . Volume down . Change the channel , you know channel up , channel down ? # ME: Another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it , but probably a lot of them that's actually their parents money . # ME: I don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , a fifteen year old you know . # UI: I think As well it'd be j the gimmick factor for the younger people . # UI: But practically I don't think it's # PM: It's a , it's a gimmick factor that they like at first , # UI: It'll wear off . # PM: Okay . Let's see here . # UI: Do you wanna put your cord back in ? # PM: I was sent a couple of things to modify our new requirements . # PM: the remote's only gonna be for the television , which is good because we already decided y your research showed that not only is a universal remote more complicated , it's more cost , more costly . # PM: And your re research showed that you know most of the people don't even use it . # PM: I think you said fifty percent of the people only use half the or ten percent of the buttons . # PM: So if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem . # PM: So we don't have to worry about that . # PM: but we do have to use the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , which is we put the fashion in electronics . # PM: And our corporate colours are grey and yellow . # PM: And we could probably get away with black too but So those are the three the three new requirements that I was told we need to use . # PM: from all three of your presentations , I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting . # PM: We want something that looks good . # PM: we want something that's simple . # PM: We want something that you can find easily . # PM: And the speech recognition I guess is kind of give or take . # PM: It's gonna cost more . # PM: the young the younger people say that they like it . # PM: But it's probably , I would say , probably not worth the investment at this point in time . # PM: So maybe we should just do away with speech recognition . # PM: And that way we can focus on our form . # UI: I did have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing . # UI: Is that if it came with maybe a holder or holster , whatever you wanna call it . # UI: that you should put it back in . Your remote . # UI: But if you don't put it back in , you press something like a little button on that , and that just sort of sends out a beep to find where it is or something . Just by infrared . # UI: That shouldn't be too complex I would've thought . # PM: That'd be , that'd be good if we were going with our ball . # UI: it would be quite good . # PM: Or or with you know I guess with any form that would be good . # UI: The ball could sit on a # PM: You know that could be the charger . # PM: you know we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote . # PM: And that would be or solar . # PM: you know However , however you wanted to go about it , the holder could also be the charging unit . # PM: With the locator button . # PM: and if it were the ball you'd no longer have to have a flat space on it . # PM: we still have the how to hold on to it # ID: You s you still You put it on t on the couch table . # PM: It's gonna roll away . # ID: While you're watching , # ID: it's gonna roll off . # ID: that's not an issue really . # PM: I guess after the meeting we'll have some questionnaires . # PM: And and some summaries for what's going on . # PM: then we'll take lunch . # PM: Then we can come back and work on our individual work . # PM: I'll do the minutes . # PM: It looks like you're already on your way for working with the components . # PM: chips , the what chips we need and what you know how to power it and whatnot . # PM: User interface concept , we want it to be something simple . # PM: Minimal number of buttons . # PM: I guess our , I guess our main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look , you know . # PM: Did you have time earlier to work on that . # PM: Did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done ? # UI: I'll have a look , try look at the actual appearance in the next break . # UI: I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed . # UI: The ball is probably not a good idea . # UI: And even something that's held like that might be difficult . # UI: So that I think it still has to be a variation . # UI: On maybe a rect on a rectangle but maybe not necessarily as boring , as plain as a rectangle . # PM: Shall we maybe shoot for a specific target group ? # PM: That way we could l I mean if it were , if we were shooting for young guys then it's a certain look to the remote . Or girls or older people ? # PM: Would that you think that would help us find a specific form ? That we would wanna pick out ? # UI: I don't know if that might cope with like the trend-watching . # UI: I find anything more on that . # ME: not yet but maybe by the next meeting we'll have some info on that . # PM: we know that the remote's gonna have to be we'll just say we've got a colour scheme for it . # PM: yellow and you know yellow it's nice and bright , with the buttons being grey or black . # PM: And our slogan pasted somewhere on it , on the bottom # UI: Bottom perhaps # PM: Maybe we could sketch a so basically all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just kind of a rectangular sort . # PM: maybe we could flare it or something . # PM: So it's more of course this will look like a bone then . # PM: go ahead and erase this . # PM: Hope everyone memorised that # UI: it might be to look at sort of the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones , and the shapes that the they've been going . # UI: They've gone from big brick block things , which is a remote control is , to sort of slinky small things . # PM: everybody's got a mobile phone right ? # PM: Except for me now . # PM: But they are all , you know , mobile phones they've kind of taken a turn to where they're really small . # PM: which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time . # PM: But then again you don't want you know like the first mobile phone that was this big and you had a handbag to carry it around in . # PM: we've got basically what remotes look like now is kind of what we're what we're stuck with . # PM: Maybe we could go with a square or something . # PM: you know with minimal number of buttons . # PM: I guess you've got you know one through nine . For typing in your channels . # PM: you've got volume , up and down . # PM: Channel up and down . # PM: Usually at the top . # ID: That's the classical design . # PM: That's that's pretty much all you need I think . # PM: A menu button , maybe . # PM: if we want the remote to do other things like or I guess the T_V_ to be able to change the tint and the colour and you know all those kind of things that are built into T_V_s , we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in , press the menu button , scroll up and down to select it . # ID: Talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not too bad . # ID: Talk about maybe f look at that from the side , there maybe . # ID: Which is technically the easiest option . # ID: Would probably be like a scrolling , little scrolling wheel like this . # PM: Like a wheel on your mouse . # ID: , sort of like that . # ID: You can even if we're coming from mice , we can even add a click function , where you , in order to verify the information you just press it down . # ID: Also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you wanna make it square for the looks of it , then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add a little bulge down here . # ID: which maybe from an engineering point this could be holding the batteries and so on . # ID: You know what I'm getting at here , # ID: fel look at it from the side . It's like that . # ID: Then you hold it in your hand like this . # ID: And maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side . # UI: To the thumb Maybe the buttons could like decrease in s the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important , the smaller here . # ID: You can also have it , maybe , talking about mobile phones again , sliding open . # ID: With the lesser used functions on this part , # ID: and then it slides into that part . And out . # UI: just like o on a sort of side view . Something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better . # UI: So you know you just sort of have your hand # ID: Mm well I was just thinking , this of course causes # UI: Right on the and your thumb would be up here type thing . # ID: causes a problem for left or right-handed people actually . So . # UI: that's also true . # UI: instantly sort of always going for the right-handed person . # UI: But I mean the older so # PM: is everyone who in here's right-handed , left-handed ? # PM: You guys all right-handed ? # UI: Right-handed , # PM: I'm left-handed but I , so I can say that most things are designed for right-handed people . # PM: Like the written language . Or English . # ME: Maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote . Special order . # PM: I would say it should be probably designed for a right-handed p person . # PM: but that's good . # PM: That's w I think we've got a kind of a good plan there . At least for what buttons we're gonna use . # PM: So we've got I like the scroll , the scroll action and the . # UI: I mean I'm just thinking maybe if it was circular with the sort of that sort of the sort of early idea we had , with the way that was more like that , whereas this is just a one-handed thing that you sort of almost wrap round the thumb . # UI: So you'd have your , you'd put your hand into there with the thumb there . # UI: And then your thumb would do you'd have all the buttons sort of round here . # UI: And that I think could work . On any hand . If you just had it like wrapped round there . Left or right . # PM: Kinda like holding a # ID: That minimises it size-wise as well . # UI: Minimise its size . # UI: It could be you know really quite small . # ID: Mm . Then there's maybe another point of making it a two-in-one kind of thing . # ID: If we have a smaller a smaller device that actually fits into the big one . # ID: You give it the full functions in here , and just a couple of functions in there . Like your zap zapping device is just u channels up-down , volume , and on-off . # UI: Zapping functions . # ME: Could be good . # PM: So two remotes in one . # PM: But then would be easier to lose one or the other . # ID: Means the big one has to be sufficiently big . # ID: And perhaps heavy , so you can't move it around . # PM: It actually is your coffee table . # ID: Make it a piece of furniture . # ID: yes . Yes , there you go . # ID: Or a statue or something . # PM: Okay . Well we need to finish up here . # PM: So for the next So for the next before the next meeting w sh shall we work on you're watching trends to see what kind of new information we've got going on . # PM: Manuel you're going to work on the components for what we're gonna use . # PM: Let's go with our rounded kind of fit in your hand let's explore the possibility of having the two-piece . # PM: So one for the quick zapping and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand . # PM: And Ryan you work on how well they'll work with the us with the user . So both of those concepts . # UI: How well it'll work # PM: And okay I think we made some good progress here . # PM: see you in I dunno . # PM: I gu I guess we'll take lunch in about half an hour . # PM: Or I guess we'll be taking lunch shortly and then in about half an hour after that we'll probably have another meeting .
# PM: Is everyone here ? # PM: This is our conceptual design meeting . # PM: I'll just take a few minutes and go through the previous minutes . # PM: then each of you will have your presentation , and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control . # PM: And then we'll have forty minutes for finishing up . # PM: I'll go through the mee through the minutes first . # PM: , we just refreshed our goal of making the finest remote control available . # PM: we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . # PM: our Marketing Expert gave us some i information from interviews with a hundred different remote users . # PM: with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before . # PM: People thought their remotes were ugly , that remotes zap a lot . # PM: they only use a finite amount of buttons . # PM: and that they often lose the it's easy to lose a remote . # PM: which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple . # PM: And some sort of locator . # PM: Either a button or tracking device . # PM: And that it should look different than what's out there . # PM: Kind of mixed response on the speech recognition . # PM: The younger people said they wanted it , older people did not . # PM: I think we decided that the expense was not necessarily worth it , and that it was probably a gimmick , that would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves . # PM: Then the User Interface Designer explored some of the technical functions of the remote . # PM: the simple versus the complex . # PM: The simple one being better for a user , the complex better for an engineer . # PM: and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote , something simple . # PM: and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote , because increasing cost and increasing complexity . # PM: we would just have a T_V_ remote . # PM: and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . # PM: Have it s be something that looks different . # PM: And finally our Industrial Designer gave us a rundown of how the remote will work . # PM: from energy source , what we would use . # PM: Batteries because we don't wanna have a cable . # PM: How that would power the remote and the lamp . # PM: If we were to have one . # PM: the user interface then would connect to a chip , which would work with the infrared controls to send the signal to the T_V_ . # PM: I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . # PM: something that will fit into easily into someone's hand . # PM: And with a , just a few buttons . # PM: Just the basics . # PM: And with a scrolling function also . # PM: and I will leave that , leave it at that . # PM: We're watching trends . # ME: Can I have your cable please ? # PM: I suppose that you can have this . # ME: Okay so I was looking at trend-watching . # ME: unfortunately I wasn't given too much information . # ME: I was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . # ME: And then I'll just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that . # ME: okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , which I think we've kind of already discussed before . # ME: the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . # ME: And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . # ME: And thirdly the remote would be easy to use . # ME: As far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . # ME: So that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , but we can try . # ME: and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel . # ME: Okay so from that , as we've already said , we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel . # ME: I think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design . # ME: But I think that , even if it's very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers , so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and Whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that . # ME: for technologically innovative , we've talked about the tracking device . # ME: We brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further . # ME: And Manuel had suggested the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , that we could change a little bit . # ME: We need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , which I think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for . # ME: we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . # ME: I don't know , I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable . # PM: A banana shape ? # UI: Oh it was sort of banana shaped . # ME: Or with exterior designs . # ME: But my question is , I mean the stereotypically speaking , you kind of picture males with their remote controls , and I'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside . # ME: So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable , or I don't know , different options for female , male target groups . # ME: And then the spongy feel . # ME: I guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there . # ME: C and look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls . # ME: So that's that . # PM: So possibly like a , # PM: just to butt in for a second . # PM: Possibly like a cover like they have for mobile phones ? # ME: That's what I was thinking . # UI: Those like , sort of spongy ones . # PM: You have one with a flag , and one with a banana and one that's a spongy # ME: So when you buy your remote you can buy # ME: various coverings . # PM: Mm various covers . # UI: What's it called ? # UI: Cust you personalised , . # ME: Personalise your remote . # PM: We could leave that to the cover department . # PM: We all know they've got nothing to do all day . # UI: Why can't I see the I talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device . # UI: so I've looked at some of the stuff I was sent , try and get some inspiration . # UI: But keep in mind that our own ideas that we had . # UI: I was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices . # UI: They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly . # UI: There's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote . # UI: there's a graphical use , where you look at pictures and well on a screen . # UI: A command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response . # UI: and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes . # UI: You can't really see that picture well , but there's various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated . # UI: So , then I had a look at new products that are on the market . # UI: Not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise . # UI: this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices . # UI: I have a there is a picture . # UI: You surf your favourite channels with your voice . # UI: Store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ and audio . # UI: And you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions . # UI: So the technology is there . # UI: the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there has scroll down functions on the side . # UI: You can sort of just make those out . # UI: And then on the right is obviously an iPod , which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there , and really is , and all that is just a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through . # UI: That is a possibility . # UI: And nothing's simpler really . # UI: then there's things like this , which is a kid's remote , where the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . # UI: So the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch . # UI: And it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control . # UI: So I don't know if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components , maybe it can have more components you know , different remotes . # UI: the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your devices , as to what , you know , things you use . # UI: Sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a V_ for volume . # UI: Just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design . # UI: I think , d carrying on from what I've already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . # UI: Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit . # UI: And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote . # UI: it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus . # UI: Stuff like gets more and more compli complicated . # UI: And then the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed . # UI: And that is it . # UI: Why am I Where are we ? . # UI: Just to sort of show you . # UI: M they've even got things like that . # UI: Which is just for your gr ninety year old grandma ? # ID: That's industrial design for cranes , stuff like that . # PM: Notice the giant dog bone shape ? # ID: Makes sense , makes sense . # PM: Also good for animals . # UI: Why's my screen crazy ? # ID: Well let's see . # ID: I'm going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior . # ID: Just to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the stuff in there . # ID: I've more information on possible materials as well . # ID: What we can and cannot do . # ID: but let's just wait for this to load up and I'll show you what we're talking about here . # ID: The details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . # ID: The underside , that's pretty cheap piece of technology really top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , and it passes it on to a row of further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , which later on is being , is being transferred to a infrared lamp which then of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal it's getting and will do what you tell it . # ID: So much for the workings of the of the remote control itself . # ID: Its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , that are received by the television . # ID: When you press a key you complete a specific connection . # ID: The chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed . # ID: It produces a morse code line signal specific to that button . # ID: Right . Pretty clear . # ID: Transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . # ID: The sensor in the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately . # ID: This is the circuit board from the other side . # ID: the lower part of it , I don't know if you can see that properly , with the green greenish board is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over . # ID: you can see the circuit board itself . # ID: That's the cheapest way to make electronic connections basically on the market . # ID: what you do is you have , don't have cables , but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board . # ID: These are the actual keys that are being pressed . # ID: They close the electric circuit . # ID: That then sends the signal to the chip on the other side . # ID: That would be behind here . # ID: which sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there . # ID: Now as you can see this is the rubber button version of it . # ID: the way it works is that you have the keys here . # ID: The rubber button has a little metal plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here . # ID: And thus gives on the signal . # ID: Now this is the simple version . # ID: we are talking this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . # ID: We are talking something more complicated of course , it's going to be more expensive as well . # ID: And not only that . # ID: we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . # ID: I've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic , rubber , as well . # ID: rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls . # ID: So it's pretty squishy . # ID: That would that would serve that purpose . # ID: we could also use wood , or titanium . # PM: What's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium ? # ID: I don't have an information on that . # ID: However our company obviously can provide us with the titanium , so I assume , I'm , I was given an okay to use it . # ID: It certainly is an expensive material , I'm aware of that , but I was given an okay . # ID: But there are certain restrictions to certain materials . # ID: Now let's first go through the list with the materials . # ID: So we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . # ID: Can also mix these . # ID: as for the energy source , we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting . # ID: what we could use is , or what I was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery . # ID: Interestingly enough . # ID: we could use solar cells . # ID: Or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy . # ID: Such as like watches you know . Where you just move them m move the actual device and this pr provides it with some energy . # ID: So obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really . # ID: You don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it solar cell is interesting . # ID: May fail though , every here and there . # UI: Would you have to leave it by the window ? # ID: . Or you know you lose it , it lies behind the couch for a week # PM: Works well in Arizona but in Edinburgh not so # ID: Always the you # ME: Y probably not . # ID: the kinetic energy thing might work , but the same problem . # ID: You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it starts to work . # ID: So I'd say what we're stuck with really is the basic battery . # ID: Which also makes a base station basically obsolete . # ID: We don't need that then . # ID: However our interface options are push-buttons . # ID: In which in the production of which or in manufacture of which our company is expert . # ID: However we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option . # ID: And they are possible . # ID: We have an okay for scroll wheels . # ID: however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an L_C_D_ into the remote control as well . # ID: This however may exclude certain materials . # ID: If you have a squishy kind of remote control , then an L_C_D_ screen may be affected by the movement . # ID: Hence we might not be able to put it in there . # ID: There's also restrictions to , when it comes to the chip . # ID: If we have a more sophistic sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic set-up that we that I've just presented , the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well . # ID: I don't have any details to , when it comes to the cost but it will be a significant difference . # ID: I'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip , but that's not up to me to decide really . # ID: So that's for the for the scroll wheel . # ID: it limits our choice and squishy is hip , so I'd say rather not go for that . # ID: solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex surface or remote control . # ID: But obviously that's not our problem since we have decided or against solar cells , I assume Or is anybody still # PM: No I think I think batteries are probably the way to go . # ID: which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional I assume . # ID: With the titanium we cannot make it a curved design . # ID: We would just be able to make it flat and a straight design pretty much . # ID: Which I assume would exclude some of the more sophisticated versions . # UI: Would the sort of spongy and the plasticky thing y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a it is plastic but then they have sort of a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff . # ME: Like a covering . # UI: So I don't know if that would still be possible to have you know in plastic . # UI: But then where do people hold it ? # UI: Just all be sort of spongy . # ME: The we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts , so they can remove it . # UI: as the possibility of having a graphical display on it , like a screen ? # UI: Like the iPod ? # ID: You can have an L_C_D_ screen . # ID: but therefore no rubber will be used . # ID: So plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will of course influence the form . # ID: With plastic , as I understand it , you can use any form . # ID: Or rubber and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form . # ID: So the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , add an L_C_D_ screen , and then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium . # ID: if you wanna make it a particular shape , use plastic . # ID: Add an L_C_D_ screen , add a scroll wheel , that'll be fine . # ID: Or make it just push-buttons . # ID: Basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of options . # ID: Maybe not the nicest feel . # ID: Or not much originality really . # PM: So the ru wait the rubbery we can shape it however we want ? # PM: Or the rubbery we cannot ? # ID: With rubber we could sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it , but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an L_C_D_ screen . # ID: That's the tricky thing . # UI: Could we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen , and then j just sort of that initial shape we had , just which is sort of banana-esque . # UI: So that's thing if we did it yellow . # UI: And you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that sort of grip the thumb bit . # UI: They wouldn't have any they're just on the exterior . # UI: They wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing . # PM: Is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ? # ID: S Certainly can be done yes . # ID: if that doesn't affect the functional side of it all . # ID: Like say just the underside or so then it can be done . # ID: The fruit design How about affecting the surface of the actual remote control ? # ID: Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously , but give it like the surface of an orange , banana , whatever . # PM: What about a smell ? # ID: Just design-wise . # PM: T to the remote ? # UI: You could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose . # UI: In different ye yellows . # ME: Bright citrus colours . # UI: I don't suppose we have to stick to co # ID: Well we we're supposed to stick to the company colours though , # UI: Stick to the colours . # ID: that's yellow and grey . # ME: Yellow and grey . # PM: Yellow and grey . # ID: So what have we , lemon , banana , is # UI: Mm grapefruit . # ID: Grapefruit is what we'd go for , when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps . # PM: I would say , if I were to make a decision , I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower end of the spectrum of importance . # ME: I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous , # ID: Well we have it banana-shaped already , kind of . # ME: Well we kinda do . # PM: Well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit-minded remote buyer . # UI: and if it if it was done yellow , which is a company colour . # ME: And if it's yellow ? # PM: It's it's yellow . It's curved . # ME: Grey buttons . # ID: Well so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana ? # PM: couple of couple of grey stripes . # PM: We could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that person could turn it over . # UI: On the gr the rubbery grips could be grey . # PM: It would look like a banana just sitting on their table . # PM: Rather than rather th # UI: It could and then you could actually h put the banana-shaped thing on the fruit bowl , on the coffee table , and then people would always know where it was . # PM: Maybe the holder , if we were to have a holder , it could be shaped like a fruit . # ME: Could look like a fruit bowl . # ID: It could be an ape . # PM: Could be , it could be an ape or a fruit bowl . # PM: we could have a variety of options here . # PM: Do you have more to your presentation ? # ID: That's pretty much it . # ID: I informed you about the materials , what the interior has to look like , and what the limitations to certain materials are on there you go . # PM: I'm gonna plug in here real quick . # PM: Like I said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here . # ME: So is the two piece idea out ? # ME: Or have we not decided ? # UI: Well we sort of rid of that because gonna use a battery . # UI: And the base station might not be necessary . # ME: Oh right okay . # ID: Well we can still design a two-piece remote without having a base , having one of them be a base station , but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions , or you take out the smaller piece . # ID: We can still do that . # ID: However of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much . # ID: So which then , as I understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive . # ID: Say like have a scroll wheel and on both of them , or have an L_C_D_ screen and so on so on . # ID: You'd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button design which we saw there . # ID: But could be done , of course . # PM: so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting . # PM: for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source , the chip-on-print , and the case . # PM: Probably case material . # PM: And probably a shape also . # PM: and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape , what , what the type is . # PM: And what kind of supplements we'll have . # PM: Energy source I think we've , I think we've decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet . # PM: And we have five minutes . # ID: Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print , as I said , the more advanced features you want , the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive . # ID: if you want just a normal button version , the chip-on-print is gonna be a cheap one . # PM: I guess we should pick the case then . # PM: If we go with the plasticky case , or the plastic case , then the chip-on-print is still kind of , we could have either or . # PM: We could have a complex one or a non-complex . # PM: But did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us ? # ME: Well what about what you said , like putting the # ME: finger grips just on top of the plastic ? # UI: Just a little bit of . # PM: So we would , we would have the L_C_D_ screen ? # ID: as long as the pla the rubber is nowhere near the controls , yes . # PM: So I guess the case would be plastic , with Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . # PM: It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe . # ID: M more of a l lamination perhaps . # ME: So then for the scroll , are we going for the iPod type ? # PM: Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right ? # PM: I guess that , is that , is that about it ? # PM: So we have a good idea of what we're gonna need to do on this ? # PM: okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes . # PM: Here's what's gonna be going on . # PM: Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design . # PM: Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design . # PM: Corrine we'll want a product evaluation . # PM: And the two of you get to play with the modelling components and maybe and get us a prototype . # PM: Which should go along well with your look-and-feel design and your interface . # PM: So that basically just be working on the prototype , we'll accomplish your other two actions .
# PM: Soon as I get this . # PM: This is our last meeting . # PM: I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . # PM: and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation . # PM: then we will do an evaluation . # PM: or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . # PM: Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . # PM: then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line . # PM: let's see , minutes from the last meeting . # PM: we looked at the trends . # PM: We had the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . # PM: It was twice as important as anything else . # PM: they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . # PM: and a spongy feel . # PM: So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . # PM: they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . # PM: then we looked at the method for coming up with our own remote . # PM: looking at other devices . # PM: the iPod , we really liked the look of that . # PM: we also had the kid's remote for a simple idea . # PM: a two part remote , which was what were originally looking at . # PM: and then there was talk of spee speech recognition becoming more predominant and easier to use . # PM: But I think we've still decided not to go with that . # PM: Then we looked at the components the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . # PM: and basically how , what were making for the prototype . # PM: So I'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over . # UI: The prototype discussion . # PM: The prototype . # PM: Do you need a this ? # ID: Can try to plug that in there # UI: There is our remo the banana . # UI: basically we st went with the colour yellow . # UI: working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it's basically designed around a banana . # UI: but it would be held in such a fashion , where it is , obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic . # UI: These would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . # UI: So that's so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . # UI: but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . # UI: You have to use your imagination a little bit . # UI: And this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through . # UI: And the simplest functions would be almost identical to an iPod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . # UI: Volume up and down . # UI: And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . # UI: It's that simple . # UI: That just represents the infrared beam . # UI: That's a simple on and off switch . # UI: I don't know , we could use the voice . # UI: T that blue bits should be yellow , that that'd be where the batteries would be I suppose . # UI: that's about it . # UI: It's as simple as you , we could make it really . # UI: Is there anything you want to add ? # ID: That's what we have there . # ID: That's plastic . # ID: Plastic covered with rubber . # ID: We might add some more underneath here . # ID: Maybe give it , give it a form . # ID: I mean you're supposed to hold it like that , but just if you grab it , take it from somewhere , # UI: Doesn't make much make much difference . # ID: you have some rub . # UI: You could work left-handed or right-handed I suppose . # ID: Exactly , use both . # ID: Might as well think about # UI: T the actual thing might be smaller . # ID: Th think about the button as well . # ID: Like either put either one on either side or # PM: What but what's that button ? # ID: not do it at all . # ID: It's a quick on-off button . # UI: Just the on and off . # ID: I think it's pretty important . # ID: So you don't have to fiddle with that . # ID: that's not I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice . # ID: You wanna play with that over there . # UI: It's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy Play-Doh , # PM: Would you like to # ME: Pretty impressive . # ME: Kind of a banana . # UI: And whether or not it would fall into the cost everything I suppose . # UI: With the scroll and the L_C_D_ . # PM: Well luckily we are going to find out . # PM: Or not luckily . # PM: do you have a marketing presentation for us . # ME: You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria . # ME: So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found . # ME: Just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier . # ME: And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype . # ME: And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did . # ME: so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . # ME: we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale . # ME: And one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . # ME: With seven being false , we did not achieve that . # ME: So for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ? # PM: I think it's definitely different than anything else out there . # PM: So if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes I would say , I would say most definitely . # PM: It still has your traditional black . # UI: It's not there's no sharp angles to it . # PM: Yep , not angular . # ID: I'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average . # ID: However the colour , we don't have a say in that . # ME: I think the colours detract a little bit . # UI: Some people might say it . # ID: That has been , that has been dictated pretty much by the company . # ID: So to answer that honestly I would rather say like , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely . # ID: 'S nothing you can say about that . # ID: I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form . # PM: something more modern to go a modern colour to go with the modern form . # ID: It's different . # ID: You don't want your three feet huge L_C_D_ dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that . # ME: okay so , do you think , since we This was a sign criteria , do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then ? # ME: Does that sound good ? # ME: What do you think ? # PM: Very non-committal , four . # ME: the second one . # ME: Did we make it simple for new users ? # ID: It's very intuitive , I think . # UI: I think that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had . # ID: S give it a one . # ME: , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ? # UI: 'Cause we've brought it down to basically four controls most common , which are channel and volume . # UI: And then the other ones are just a matter of just going , just scrolling further . # PM: S scrolling through and selecting a few . # ID: So that's a one . # PM: I think that's a one . # ME: the fourth one . # ME: How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? # ME: One of the number one complaints . # ID: Something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore . # ME: Whether you want to or not , you're not gonna lose it . # UI: It's bright yellow . # UI: Bright yellow's hard to lose . # UI: But if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . That , we could maybe just use that solely for the finding thing . # UI: That was what we'd mentioned . # PM: So if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could # UI: Just just to use , to find it when it was lost . # UI: But like I said , like I don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily . # UI: And it's not gonna fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things . # UI: That's gonna be a difficult shape to # PM: And it is quite bright # UI: Maybe in the middle again , three or four or something ? # UI: I mean you know loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose , I mean a million ways . # UI: You can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it . # PM: But if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite a bit I think . # ID: You probably # PM: Probably two . # PM: If we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then I'd say two . # PM: With the speech recognition , which of course may be changed depending on budget . # ID: Y you could add an extra feature actually . # ID: Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television . # ID: We could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far . # PM: Which , which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a # UI: But I mean d just those whistling , clapping key rings you have . They're cheap . # ME: Annoying alarm or something ? # UI: So it can't be that # ID: it's based on this anti anti-theft technology for suitcases and stuff , # PM: Some sort of proximity # ID: where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping . # ID: That can't cost much . # ID: So that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to hide , so you have one piece , you have to glue somewhere behind your stick it behind your T_V_ and the other # UI: stick it on the T_V_ . # PM: Pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece . # ID: That'd be tough then . # ID: Well also your remote would alarm you if somebody stole you t your television , . # ID: Ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control . # ME: Are we adding one of these two features ? # ID: Let's add one of those features and say yes . # ME: gonna say So we're back to a one ? # ME: Are we technologically innovative ? # UI: don't get many mo remote controls with # ID: It's all just stolen technology when it comes down to # UI: it's stolen technology . # PM: But there's not a lot of yellow , there's not a lotta yellow . # ME: But for remotes # PM: Course that wasn't really # PM: we were kinda forced to take that colour . # UI: 'cause it's stolen . # PM: I don't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth . # ME: But how many remotes do you see like this ? # PM: If we added the screaming factor then we go up . # PM: I would say we're probably at four . # ME: That's gonna hurt us . # ME: spongy material ? # ID: well you have that , kind of , sort of . # PM: We have some spongy , . # UI: as much as needed , I think . # ID: It's not a one though . # ID: One would be the whole thing # PM: Because it's only got what , these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side the bottom the underneath on the back . # ID: to fold and stuff . # ID: So that's a four at most . # PM: Probably a four at most . # PM: Possibly even a five . # ME: And lastly , did we put the fashion in electronics ? # PM: If your fashion is b is Carmen Miranda , you betcha . # ID: Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the L_C_D_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour , # ID: but it definitely is # UI: Be what we were told , and they'd say , definitely . # ME: Now we just gotta calculate . # ME: Six eight twelve sixteen . # ME: Seventeen divided by s # PM: Seven is Two point two point four ? # UI: Is that some long division ? # ME: Well I haven't done math in years . # ME: What two I dunno . # UI: Just , I'm sure there's a . # ME: Okay we'll say two point four two . # ME: How does that look ? # ID: I'm impressed . # ID: I can't do that without a calculator . # UI: No I can't do long # ME: It's been a while . # UI: very impressive . # PM: And what is the acceptable criteria ? # PM: Is there like a scale that we have to hit ? # ME: They just told me to pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it basically . # PM: Alright then . # ME: So that's that . # PM: Well , let's see . # PM: Now we get to do the budget numbers . # PM: You didn't know that you were gonna have a budget . # UI: You'd been going a long time dividing that . # UI: It's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on . # UI: Two point four two basically . # ME: we'll go with that . # PM: So I have here an # ID: Fifty percent , you're kidding . # ME: Not too shabby . # PM: We want a fifty percent profit on this . # PM: Oh you can't really see that very well . # UI: Charge about three hundred quid for it . # PM: Twelve and a half Euros is what supposed to cost us . # PM: Well let's see . # PM: The f the Wonder if I can make this What the Oh it won't let me do that . # PM: Alright so at top , I don't know if you guys can read that or not . # PM: I can't 'cause I don't have my glasses on , but so we've got the energy source . # PM: There's four , five , six categories . # PM: We have energy source , electronics , case . # PM: Then we have case material supplements , interface type , and then button supplements . # PM: Okay so first of all energy source , we picked battery . # PM: and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ? # PM: Probably some e either two or four . # ID: At four it's gonna be too heavy , so that that's not our problem . # ID: People can change it every month . # ID: They won't know until after they bought it . # PM: This is consumerism . # PM: Alright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip-on-print , regular chip-on-print , advanced chip-on-print , sample sensor , sample speaker . # UI: We're advanced chip are we ? # ID: That's the advanced chip-on-print , . # PM: we have one of those . # PM: 'Kay then the case is a Probably it's double curved . # ID: Double curved , yes . # PM: Case materials are # PM: I guess it's two , since one for the top , one for the bottom . # PM: Is that right or is it just one ? # ID: No that's just one . # PM: Maybe it's one because of the # ID: It's just one mo single mould , we can do that . # PM: I guess it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero , which is nice . # ID: Exactly , right . # PM: Special colour ? # ID: That's not a special colour . # ID: It's a specially ugly colour , but it's not special . # ME: Bright yellow . # PM: Interface type . We have pushbutton , scroll-wheel interface , integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton , and an L_C_D_ display . # PM: So we actually have the L_C_D_ display # PM: and then is it the integrated or is it # UI: I'd say the integrated . # ID: Yes unfortunately . # PM: Button supplement ? Special colour ? # PM: special form ? Special material . # ID: We could of course make the buttons wood . # ID: Say mahogany or so # ME: It'd look really lovely . # PM: They cost us all the same . # UI: remote control . # PM: Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged , we shouldn't be charged anything for the button supplements . # UI: that's getting a bit I'd ignore that . # ME: Leave it blank . # PM: We're gonna leave that one blank because we run on a L_C_D_ and scroll . # PM: So our total is fifteen point five . # PM: Which I believe is # ID: that's too much . # PM: by three Euros over . # ID: It's hard to believe . # ID: So we'll go for the hand dynamo huh ? # PM: So the only thing better than a banana-shaped remote is one that you shake . # UI: What if we completely took out the one single button we've got on . # UI: And just had a scroll wheel interface . # UI: And the L_C_D_ display . # UI: I suppose the L_C_D_ C_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though . # PM: 'cause the Well 'cause we have to have both right ? # ID: I mean let's face it , it also depends on the software on the on the television . # ID: You can have the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen . # ID: So s let's take away the # UI: you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even , if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the T_V_ itself . # PM: So we may not need the L_C_D_ display ? # UI: that is possible . # ID: Right . We may not need it . # PM: Well there we go . # PM: Twelve point five . # PM: So we just remove our # UI: Make it a bigger dial . # UI: Easier to use . # UI: Even easier to use then . # PM: Besides look at what the L_C_D_ does to our lovely remote . # PM: Back to the design room boys . # ID: So we can just take away a heck of a lot of the there you go . # ME: What's the blue part ? # UI: That was just # ID: Oh that's just # UI: we ran out of yellow . # ME: Oh that's the batteries . # UI: Even simpler . # ME: Looks more like a banana . # UI: For all those fruit lovers out there . # ID: One more criteria . # PM: Okay so the costs under twelve point five Euro . # PM: Was no . We redesigned it . Now it's yes . # PM: Project evaluation . # PM: project process , satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , new ideas found . # PM: I guess that Let's see here . # PM: I think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me . # PM: But I'd like to hear your thoughts . # ME: Trying to fill in some time there . # PM: h what did you think of our project process ? # UI: I think we did I think we did quite well . # ME: Good teamwork . # ID: Just half a day , you have a remote . # UI: Right from the start of the day . # UI: We sort of knew where we were going straight away I thought . # PM: we st we started off a little weak . # PM: Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning . # PM: But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing . # PM: room for creativity ? # PM: There was that . # PM: I think we tried a lotta different things and I think it was interesting as you guys brought up more information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things . # PM: you guys worked together well as a team . # PM: And the means ? # PM: Which was the whiteboard and the pens . # UI: We've used the whiteboard . # PM: I had some problem with the pen I think , but minus your p # ME: Minus your PowerPoint fiasco . # ID: Well that's not my fault . # ID: That's obviously the people I work for that work for me , # ID: they've just you know Heads are gonna roll , believe me . # PM: we have a list of employees that you would like fired . # PM: N new ideas found ? # PM: Yes for the remote . # PM: Maybe no not f for # UI: Technology used . # PM: Costs are within the budget . # PM: Project is evaluated . # PM: complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary . # PM: And I still have to do my minutes for the last meeting . # PM: so there will probably be another questionnaire coming up . # PM: And then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can , what goes on after that . # ME: We might have a while though . # PM: But that's the end of our meeting .
# UI: No I don't think so it has to be like that and you have to adjust the length . # UI: Okay , and then . # PM: we will wait for Anna , a few minutes . # ID: Yours is well # UI: I think you can put anywhere you want , actually . # ID: but the mic should not # UI: It's not a directional mic , anyway . # PM: I think it should work like this . # PM: So I will try to get my presentation running . # ID: Can't help you with that . # PM: It's no matter . # ID: Then press al # PM: On this normal # PM: Doesn't appear on the screen here . # ID: Right well Wow . Amazing . # PM: and you can put can clip it on your # PM: good morning , everyone . # PM: Welcome at the kick off meeting of our latest project . # PM: I hope you all have been updated about it . # PM: w we will try to structure this meeting with an a with an agenda as presented here . # PM: after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other . # PM: See what our roles are in this project . # PM: We have been provided with some w technical tools to communicate and to well , learn from each other's plans as I can say w we will also try to get acquainted to this tools they are also new to me I don't know whether you worked with them before . # PM: then we will come to the to the to the actual project plan . # PM: You all know I hope how it's about the new r remote control we are going to design . # PM: then we will discuss , well , how it should be and wh what our new product should look lite like . # PM: And well then after some twenty five minutes I hope we can end this meeting . # PM: basically this is about a new c remote control . # PM: When you design a new product you of you of course want it to be original . # PM: we want to be distinguished , People want to when they look at the shelf want to think , well that's the product I need . # PM: So it needs to be trendy . # PM: I mean trendy is what people want , so then I w they will buy our product . # PM: But then , it also should work user friendly and otherwise people uh well it will not be rated very well in consumer articles and like that . # PM: the general outline of new project will be we first go through a functional design phase . # PM: You all get certain task in this in this phase and then we will meet again and discuss this functional design . # PM: And the same holds for the ph two phases after this , the conceptual design and after that a more detailed design in which the final project should get its definite shape . # PM: Alright , but first we will do some tool training . # PM: In all in front of you see the notebooks and w n note blocks and we have here a white-board . # PM: And well it should work I've read it from my from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar . # PM: I didn't find out yet how it work , but maybe one of you did , so # ID: Under documents in the shared folder . # PM: Do we have to say something about that ? # PM: I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder . # ID: I guess we'll have a shared folder with documents that we can share . # PM: Yes well we will then find out ho how it works . # PM: this seems to me , yes , some computer program but I didn't find it yet . # PM: we'll come to that later . # PM: now we will try out the white-board we have here . # PM: I would suggest # ID: Each of us is going . # PM: we should try to t to draw on it and then well it should be smart some way . # PM: I I'm not really sure how this works , but # ID: shall I start ? # PM: a good idea Mael . # UI: you can start it you know . # ME: I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard , but they'll be recording what we write down . # UI: they will record through that . # UI: There's a sensor over there which is going to record the strokes that you make . # ME: But for us it's just like a normal whiteboard . # ID: But it's Actually , I think I cannot go with # PM: You you D doesn't it work ? # PM: Maybe someo Maybe maybe Anna , maybe you can start . # PM: Then he can maybe find out to get his cord right . # ME: I have to draw . # PM: Why don't you draw your favourite animal on th on the white-board . # ME: M my favourite animal . # ME: this is all tangled up here . # ME: That's better . # PM: We will try to guess what it is . # ME: I'm a very bad drawer . # ME: You're not gonna be able to guess from my drawing . # ME: I'm a bad drawer . # ME: They're ears , by the way . # ME: close though . # ME: Okay so like a pet animal . # PM: It's like a cat , so I guess it's a cat . # ME: not a cat though . # PM: What is this now ? # UI: you forget about it . # ID: You're on the knife . # UI: I think it's fine . # UI: I just don't want to carry it off . # UI: Man , this wires , We need a wireless microphone . # UI: Pro specially we should next project we should take l like that . # PM: that's the cat . # PM: but that's also kind of cat , isn't it ? # UI: the dog doesn't have a tail ? # ME: It's got a tail then . # PM: B bo both predators . # UI: I thought so . The dogs have a tail . # PM: d did you work out cord ? # ME: And you guessed cats without a tail . # ID: I think I will go without it , # UI: It'll still not extend , It's not up to that . # ME: Okay , there you go . # ME: what favourite characteristics . Dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun . # ME: This is why you're the designer . # ME: And I'm marketing . # PM: Yes . Yes , yes this is Yes definitely a horse . Yes . # PM: Oh very good . So I suppose it # UI: I think you can put that . # ME: A blue and black zebra . # PM: Can you can meet them in Africa , I think . # PM: Yes . Very good . So # ME: The very rare blue zebras . Yes . # UI: I'll tell to get it off my # ME: You got a lot of room here . # ME: You can probably reach . # UI: it's not for that . # PM: I hope you have some space in your the horse of Mael . # UI: So what should I draw ? # UI: He has already to do cat . # PM: This looks likes a cat who has been driven over . # ID: And we should sum up its favourite charas characteristics , # PM: Yes , the moustache . # PM: That's that's definitely a cat . # ID: And i Th They like to sleep , that's why you said you they are like this . # PM: It's quite , you know relaxed situation . # ID: She has the small legs . # PM: Th thank you , Matthew . # ID: Thank you , Matthew . # ME: It's a very big rat . Or a very small cat . # PM: Yes , this is certain some contribution to our project . # PM: Which animal has not been drawn yet . # PM: you've all drawn land animals , so why not draw an animal from the water . # ID: Okay , in the water . # ME: I don't know what that is . # ME: It's a bit It's a bit hard to guess . # ID: Put it colours . # ID: Maybe it would help us . # UI: The cat is going to eat the fish or the rat ? # ID: With different pen widths . # ME: it's a shark now . # UI: it's a baby shark , it looks to me , you know it's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish , no ? # ME: Now it's a swordfish . # PM: Why not . A swordfish . # ID: You have some in Australia , # ME: I've never seen one , no . # PM: I hope it still works . # ID: I dunno if we need to spend time on that , actually # UI: You should go for the next one it seems to me . # PM: this tool seemed to work . # PM: Let's continue to the real stuff . # PM: our project finance thing . # PM: when we are and when w you are going to design w we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product will be about twenty five Euros , so when designing a project I also look at you Mael , keep in mind uh People # PM: want to get the feeling this is a twenty five Euro project pr product . # ID: Per remote control , Per project . # PM: more interesting for our company of course , p profit aim , about fifty million Euro . # PM: we have to sell quite a lot of this things . # PM: we will try to get at a international market it will be I think mainly Europe and Northern America , # UI: , the sale man , four million . # PM: maybe some Asian countries . # PM: also important for you all is the product production cost must be maximal twelve Euro and fifty cents . # ID: So it's half of the selling price , if I am good in mathematics . # PM: Yes , of course . # PM: we still have to make a profit , # UI: They have to sell at least four million to make a profit # PM: You all have to be paid . # UI: we have to make we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit . Fifty mill # ID: you're g very good in mathematics . # ID: Four million . # PM: So well I think w when we are working on the international market , in principle it has enough customers when we have a good product we could meet this aim , I think . # PM: that about finance . # PM: And now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and well keep in mind this first point , it has to be original , it has to be trendy , it has to be user friendly . # PM: , maybe someone can mention some additional prerequisites for a good remote control . # UI: Of course it should have a on off button . # PM: Yes , well i it should have the expected functionality of a remote control . # UI: and it depends what application you are using it for . # UI: You might need # PM: We wer we were thinking television . # UI: We are targ targeting the television set . # UI: you need to record the channels . # UI: You need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way , # PM: Th th that's very handy I always miss it and on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number , especially when you have a lot of channels . # ID: And just before starting the detailed discussion , maybe we are the marketing guy ? Or # ME: I'm marketing . # ID: So you are the marketing . # ID: And you are in the u use user interface design . # ID: So just I wanted to be sure . # ID: And I I'm the industrial designer Because I don't know you very well , actually , but . # UI: I'm Matthew . You know . # ID: Happy to meet you . # PM: A and I'm Nanne . # UI: I thi think you know me , # ID: so Just on your web page but not face to face . # PM: Are there some other very important things to do well , to specify in this first phase of the project . # PM: the browse function , as you m mentioned . # UI: And , you'd need the usual ones , like the changing the volume , changing the channel and then you Today we have teletext and all those things . # UI: Tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that , so # ID: Like internet on the on T_V_ ? # UI: Now we are looking for television things or I_P_ . # UI: For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up . # ME: But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet . # UI: it's coming up , actually . The personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up . # PM: Mm , well I think w y you two should , I think , think this over w espec what , what functionality . # ID: Of course , and first before designing the func thinking about the functionalities , we need to know what are the user requirements . # ID: then if they need internet , then we would be able to p to propose something with uh T_V_ over I_P_ . # ME: But Ninety percent of the time , ninety nine percent of the time , people will be using the main functions , the volume , the different channels , we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use . # PM: Mm mm . Keep k keep in mind i it's a it's a twenty five Euro unit , so uh the very fancy stuff w we can leave that out , I think . # PM: twenty five Euro you expect a quite , well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control . # UI: in that case you can you always hook up with someone who is providing that and you know , you sell their product as well as your product with them , you know . # ME: So try and get T_V_ manufacturers to # ID: but w we want to design a new one . Mm . # UI: it's okay , I understand . # UI: So we need some numbering buttons , some teletext things and then # ID: the main is browsing . # PM: but ab about the spec the buttons , the buttons that will be on it . I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting . # PM: I would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting . # UI: we are alread mm . Mm . # PM: you know now the basic the basic things . # PM: just for the next meeting , well , you wor yes , work on a design , keep it general , I mean so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions . # PM: you will be working on technical function design , so And you and you and uh well , think about requirements , Does it need internet , or do we stay at basic television interface . # PM: I think we should now all go work uh at this and you will be informed via email and other kind of communication . # PM: next meeting will be in thirty minutes . # PM: K keep it in mind .
# PM: I see all everybody's here , And we can start meeting . # ME: What's the agenda for this meeting ? # PM: I will present here agenda with slides to you . # PM: as you can see here . # PM: first just to mention I will take notes of this meeting and I will try to work them out and give them to you . # PM: I've also made notes of the previous meeting and I was about to send them you but then I had to go to this meeting so you will get them too # ID: So y you are the secretary also . # PM: Then I hope you all have worked out some presentations about well you the task given to you in the previous meeting . # ID: Perfectly yeah of course uh-huh . # PM: W We will in a minute we will start with them . # PM: , we will see in which order we will handle them of . # PM: then I will bring in some new requirements I got from the account manager , I try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it . about the functions in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the # ID: You mean the social target group who we wants to target ? # PM: Yes I mean well yes w who are we going to well to sell this , # ID: Oh the customers , okay . # PM: the customers , indeed yes . # PM: Think that's important matter . # ME: That's the big question # PM: And then we will close this meeting and after this meeting we'll have a lunch . # PM: Anna can you c do you have a presentations ? # PM: You don't have presentation ? # PM: you want a table to # ME: I c I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything . # PM: Yes yes maybe you can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary . # ME: I've just been presented with some research we've done in a small focus group a hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control . # ME: probably can't email this to you , I've just got a web page with some data on it . # ME: basically it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls . # ME: seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . # ME: Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . # ME: Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . # ME: seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television . # ME: Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that . # PM: Do you Do you have this information on the web page you said ? # ME: I have an a web page yes . # PM: mayb maybe you can send an email to me later . about this . # ME: So basically there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control . # ME: , power and volume selection are only used a few times within this per hour . # ME: , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently . # ME: Teletext is used fourteen times in the hour , so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . # ME: An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room , so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users . # PM: Yes yes , I have that too . # ME: Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control , they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps . # ID: It's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's # ME: Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one . Yep . # ID: Okay too much time to learn . Okay . # ME: And thirty twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . # ME: I don't know how we'd go about combating that . # UI: . What do you mean there ? # ME: Respet Repetitive strain injury . # PM: They think that or do their doctor the doctor says ? # PM: But it's the opinion of the of the users huh ? # ME: That's what the report says . # ME: and then it's got a demographic breakdown # ID: Maybe y you cannot put this webpage online on the # ME: I should be able to actually , if I email it to you now . # UI: You can disconnect it there # PM: You can maybe just # ID: it's a webpage on the C_ it's a file # ID: O otherwise you . You can connect this one . # UI: Then you can connect this one or this one All to your computer . # ID: these are important numbers that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional # ME: I need to muck around with this . # ME: It's probably easier if you put it on yours and then I'll just email it to you . # ME: It's just a web link . # ID: these numbers have to be have to be taken into account for the both user interface and functional design . # ME: One thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , hang on a minute . # ID: Because if there are many numbers and we need to select to constraint our design based on what is more important . # ME: , one thing is interesting is talking about speech recognition in a remote control . # ID: Speech recognition in # ME: And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful . # PM: D do you have numbers o on that ? # ME: I'll just get this up . # ID: So that we don't Do we not need any button on the remote control # ME: potentially , # ID: it would be all based on speech . # ME: I think even for interesti # ID: Interesting idea . # ME: I think that would not work so well . # ME: You wanna have both options . # PM: it would it would be a solution for when your remote control is lost , I mean when it has speech recognition then i then it doesn't matter where it is , my well it's we should be in range , or maybe it can respond and produce sound , so say where it is . # PM: But the these are all quite fancy features I'm not sure whether we will we can make this for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents . # UI: it would be f No you can't . # ID: And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is , maybe you know ? # UI: Oh . Well , it depends you know like there is it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , one , two , twenty three , # ID: But it's quite noisy if there is the T_V_ shouting . # UI: It's it's going to be li # PM: that that's mm . # UI: it's not going to be s so easy but u usually it's going to be more of an isolated case # PM: Do you have some more important facts # UI: but it's but I don't know with twenty fi # PM: or can we go to the next presentation ? # ID: you had to summarise maybe the # ME: This is now talking about who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it , . # ME: Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , it goes down from there , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five , twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five . # PM: Decline with age , mm . # ME: it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , which we'll be talking about later I think . # PM: Yes . We will talk about it later . # ME: Did you get the email ? # ME: Just follow that link . # ME: It'll be in a different window , yep . # ID: Okay perfect . .. . # ME: that's the figure that I was just talking about there , with the different demographics . # ME: Another thing it's talking about there is the L_C_D_ screen but there's no figures apparently on that . # PM: maybe Mael c can you give uh your presentation ? # UI: Now you can move I think # PM: , y you can move , . # ID: I can move as far as Maybe I take your chair ? # PM: Yes . You can you can sa take my chair . # UI: It's a channel selection , a module , this and this function , go to the . # ID: I think as everybody knows I'm the Industrial Designer . # ID: And in this presentation this group presentation is gonna focus on the working design of the remote control . # ID: I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very technical background what is it because I think in the product it is important . # ID: So basically the basic function of a remote control is to send messages to another system that is fixed . # ID: an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually through a infrared bit and the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages , alright . # ID: my method for designing the work design first the main point is that I would wish to make a really functional product . # ID: I would prefer to have very functional capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work . # ID: for that as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing Expert Anna and w to we should agree on what are the technical functions for this remote control and I show you the working design . # ID: So basically here is a really large view of what we want . # ID: we want an on off button , it can be it's simple but it's important , and also the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after , the components I quickly draw here , is that in this part you have the remote control the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's my method is will be to my aim would be to design the and choose the chips and the infrared components to build the remote control of course we need energy sources and uh the receiver a receiver . # ID: This is very quick design , you stop me or interrupt me if you don't agree on it on that . # ID: what I have found and after a lot of work actually I draw this I draw for you this schema that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me # ME: You drew it a long time ago ? # ID: And that's it so I won't go into details about that # PM: overwhelming . # ID: but these are my preferences to use that kind of components . # PM: And and why do you want these kind of component ? # PM: I mean , are they cheap , or are they reliable ? # PM: What were your # ID: and th you have always a compromise with reliability and i if it's expensive , but this one was not this one also really reliable that's it for the working design , I hope you get clearer view on what a remote control is in terms of technical components # PM: Yes . It it it's more clear now I think . # UI: But is it can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma # ID: No no we will This is a preference but we can always change # PM: What I w what I was thinking about the schema about the sender and the receiver , can you can you get back to it ? # PM: the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not able to change it . # PM: So we must adapt to the to the receiver . # PM: I suppose there is a standard way of communicating to televisions . # ID: We will use infrared protocol using infrared and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists but we what we can do is uh adapting the chips inside to the best chips and infrared bubbles . # UI: it to du it's just you had to change the frequencies . # ID: The frequencies ? # UI: But you should be careful , # ID: in the chip you have it # UI: people are sometime becoming problem , like a guy has recently designed a remote uh which could switch off any other T_V_s , so basically through all the things . # ID: That can control o other things . # UI: So maybe we should think of # ID: Of course we should take that into account # ME: So if the b T_V_ in the next apartment's really loud , you can just turn it off . # UI: so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's T_V_ and you can just walk away You don't have to be near the T_V_ at all . # ME: I like that idea . # PM: I feel I think M Mael will consider this th these things . # PM: Maybe we can go to your presentation Matthew . # PM: I assume you were finished here . # UI: Okay . So I can take I think mine now there . # UI: Okay so I can take mine it's okay , mm so mm . # PM: I know where it is . # UI: It's on the desktop . # UI: Technical function . # UI: Well . So I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do , I think my last presented what is going inside , so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it . # UI: So well the approach is that basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set , as Mael has pointed , and it will be decoded by the T_V_ and usually we it is easier to have keys or buttons with which people can press and then changing a button will basically change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ a and basically it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver . # UI: as Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys , people are can have a speech recognition but this is s a question which will we have to see later . # UI: But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone , and it sends a message to the T_V_ . # UI: And so generally mm I don't have some figures there are two kinds of remote if you popularly in the household , actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on , off button and play , volume change and keys for the number and more than one digit option . # UI: And if you see for example righ right now uh even the one on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , Then there is this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option , it can without any , it's a very simple thing , which you can vouch . # UI: And then you have what's the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there but it then it has other options like stop and then you play the movie or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those these are the standard commonly found remote controls in the market . # UI: And then whi which is generally used by the people . # UI: And then personal preferences I would basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the f a T_V_ and the remote video remote control because some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together so that we could aim for the like in the f coming future that type of applications with # ME: How would that work ? # ME: you've got say maybe a V_C_R_ and a T_V_ which are separate , on my one at home I've got a V_C_R_ remote which then changes the channel on the V_C_R_ and doesn't do anything on the T_V_ , so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_ ? # ME: or does it know which one you want to use ? # UI: actually you could you could think of having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing yo you still can't in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option and you could play it or You can also think about having I in a few days you will be ha in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate sitting setup box and you have something like uh you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you and you can just you know when you come back you could just switch on that thing and watch a program . # UI: In that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those kind of functionalities . # ID: These are kind of next generation functionalities . # UI: It's the next generation thing , but it is going to come in couple of years . # PM: but I think it's i it's already there , # PM: I mean the hard disk recorders I I've seen them in the shop . # UI: it's going to record your things and you and you need basically the functionalities what you need in both uh video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing . # ME: That's fair enough . # ME: But I don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here . # UI: No no we are not making a universal remote , we are just looking at giving a scenario , I have a T_V_ and tomorrow I am going to have set up box which is going to sit there and it's going to do that job for me . # PM: W w we need to decide on in how far we go to in this . # PM: Mean , you can go pretty far I f I think with functions and possible future p prospects But it's good to keep in mind . # UI: Okay so that p ends my presentation . # UI: Well . So we can always discuss about it for example the presently the video market actually this demand , video over-demand or what we call it as , it's presently booming up actually like people are providing like things like uh movies , you can select actually you want to watch a movie and your p your provider gives a list of movies , and then you select those list . # UI: basically you go off , it downloads the movie , it gives for you and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your T_V_ . # UI: And thi this is going to come . # ID: Or even you don't need to download it , it's streamed online . # UI: it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time I want to watch the movie # PM: I have received some well points of thinking over of my account manager and I would like to share them with you . # PM: first thing is teletext is a well known feature of televisions but it's getting used less and less . # PM: That's that's especially because of the internet of course . # PM: So we should think about it . # PM: Do we include it , and do we give it a prominent place on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself . # PM: as a in any case it's not used , well very much , but it's it is still used . # PM: further yes we must think , do we stay to television only , the television as we as we all know it with broadcasting signals and you can't go back or do we uh go further as Matthew indicated by supporting uh recording devices ? # ME: D_V_D_s and V_C_R_s ? # PM: And and the hard disk recorders . # PM: , furthermore , w we need really need to interest y younger customers and then with younger customers I mean people below the age of forty , and our current customers are mainly forty plus # ID: Fourteen or for O # PM: that's to that's I mean there's a market but they will grow older and you'll al always need to have the future with younger people . # PM: therefore , younger people like trendy designs , so that's w we should make our R_C_ as trendy as possible but it should also be have a reliable image , so when it looks too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all . # UI: you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys , you know right now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like a keys separately , but suppose if you take the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys you press on the top , it takes one number , you press on the bottom it takes another number , and basically uh so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually so it is like i it is like # PM: Ma Maybe you can draw it on the on the board # ME: Mm . But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we're going after a younger market , # ME: that's the mm the new and the funky things , # ID: Because they are already used to that , you know , product . # PM: it's recognisable # ME: there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones , not too many pretty remote controls . # PM: And and they are skilled by using it . # UI: So for example Well Okay , it works . Fine . # UI: for example you have presently keys like one , two , three like this , actually , and uh four five six like that and you can have keys like this in form like keys like that # PM: Mael can you hand me over this ? # ME: How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ? # ME: 'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all # PM: I think fi five min # UI: Forty minutes ? # ME: and it's a very important issue . # UI: you can have keys like which are which are like so . # UI: too sorry , so we basically don't change the original order of them but then the keys are more spacious , they don't look so there is a very sligh thing , so if you press on the top it takes the one , it takes the three , four , sorry four here five and six , so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice for you don't have too many keys but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to # PM: I think now that the idea's clear . # PM: we should now try to decide on our target group . # ME: Which I think is quite tricky . # ME: , basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ? # PM: Of course they have already one . # PM: So our remote control has to be better . # ME: But it's not going to have more functionality , 'cause it's only a low market , it's a cheap-end remote control , we can't beat modern functionality , we might we'll be able to beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it but that's not a big seller , they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as well . # ME: So I'm not sure how we can get people to buy this thing . # PM: Mm . I well I think many people said in your in your research uh the appearance of the R_C_ is important when they are buying one # ME: But why are they buying one in the first place ? # PM: that will be about functionality # ME: Mm . But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote . # ME: I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote , otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things . # ME: In that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality . # PM: So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance # ME: we can't , with the price range . # ME: We We're not building a universal remote , we're not building a high end product . # PM: What do What do you think about What componen # ID: we have twelve point five Euros per R_ s R_C_ and I think with this now you know that chips are very cheaps and we can include it in our control some new features . # ME: If we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that which would drive the cost up a lot . # PM: I don't know . I don't know whether that's necessary . # PM: Is the L_C_D_ screen # ME: For universal remotes # ID: I don't think L_C_D_ is not necessary well , th for long term . # PM: I think thi this could be this could be a market because universal remote controls tend to be quite expensive . # ME: And quite complicated to use , # PM: S so we can try to go in between , and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as complicated # ME: Not as flexible maybe , # PM: but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal uh R_C_ # PM: because it has more it is in some kind universal . # ME: But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on . # PM: but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group . # PM: People yes . Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal control . # ME: I don't know really what the price range for remote controls is . # ME: Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , or are we kind of middle to bottom ? # PM: I think when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for less money . # PM: d Do you agree ? # UI: Well I it's fine with me like the price as long as it is not too expensive . # UI: and it d Our provin # ID: because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers the price of a chip is price of a chip is very cheap . # ID: I'm okay for designing a ne less a kind of universal R_C_ . # PM: You think it's possible for the twelve Euro fifty ? # PM: Okay . so then we decide on going to this more universal kind of control . # UI: that's what we needed basically . # UI: that's needed right now . # UI: And basically you can look to the standards of other # ID: that's needed , . # ID: And if we want to get the market , we really need that . # ME: I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , V_C_R_ and T_V_ . # ME: And just be able to s use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time . # UI: you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them . # ID: Is that okay for you ? # PM: given we are going for this uh universal type m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific user interface content # PM: and maybe you can look on what trends are in this in this type of market . # PM: anyone has a point to bring in or shall we # UI: I don't have anything right now . # UI: We can we'll go # ID: that's fine then . # UI: and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good for the # PM: we can have lunch now . # PM: Then th the next meeting will # UI: we meet in well what are our # PM: after lunch you have we have thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting . # PM: But you will be informed via the computer . # UI: So see you later . # ID: Okay perfect .
# ME: Right first time this time . # ME: It's not that complicated , but I get it wrong every time . # ID: Okay so we are just waiting for Matthew . # ME: For Matthew , yep . # PM: I suggest we start the meeting without Matthew he's obviously late for some reason . # PM: Today we will talk about conceptual design . # PM: I hope you both did some work concerning a conceptual design . # PM: this will be the agenda for the meeting . # PM: I will take some minutes again . # PM: we will have the presentations of y of you different team members , and then try to come to decisions about the concepts you have presented . # PM: and that will we have some forty minutes to complete this . # PM: who has the fir do you ha Anna do you have your presentation ready ? # ME: I have a presentation , I'm just making this # ID: I think the Matthew it is it's important that Matthew is here because it's really a team project with a team # PM: there is Matthew . # ID: and if someone is not here then we cannot but it's okay it's good . # ME: I'll just email you this file , my presentation . # PM: Do presentation ready ? # ME: I'm just emailing it to you . # PM: did you manage # UI: I sent you the slides , you didn't see them ? # PM: Oh yes I see him , good yes . # ME: Okay it should've gone through to you . # PM: Okay mm yes I have it . # ME: Okay so this is just a presentation on the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment . # ME: can I just put this on ? # ME: we have to work out a way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it . # ME: This is to do this I will not remove my microphone . # ME: We basically used some focus group surveys which I went through with you last time , the main results of that , and some research on the current design and fashion trends that are out there at the moment , and as part of this The important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really . # ME: The most important by far was the look and feel of it . # ME: It needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there . It needs to stand out . # ME: It needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment . # ME: Most people find remote controls boring at the moment , we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out . # ME: People will wanna buy it . # ME: That was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative has to have something else , apart from just the look of it . # ME: People have to then think about it and say got something there that I want . That's a really cool feature , and it has to make them wanna buy it again . # ME: Third on the list , and again innovative was twice as important as this last aspect , it has to be easy to use . # ME: So they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it . # ME: Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , fruit and vegetables . # ME: This is basically talking about just the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , eye-catching , really bold designs , and a spongy feel . # ME: I had a talk to the design people about this , but having a remote that's tactile , that feels different , that would be really cool . # ME: That would make it stand out . # ID: can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said ? # ID: about the feeling # ME: ma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing . Spongy is the current texture , but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all , so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something , that'll be something that sets it apart , rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment . # ME: as far as the design goes , the very most important aspect was the design , to the customers . # ME: going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we've got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables . # ME: Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , they've all got those a lot of them have the changeable covers , so they can choose what colour the outside is . # ME: That's one way of looking at it . # ME: Textured feel we just talked about . # ME: Maybe it's another way of doing that . # ME: So if it's part of the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture , a spongy one or a soft one or something like that . # ME: So they can choose it li as they want to maybe to fit in with their decor in their living room , or just what they like , their sports team or whatever . # ID: that's a very good idea , . # ME: still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks . # ME: Also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment . # ME: They're big selling items . # ME: People put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that , and we can start using some of their ideas . # ME: back to technological in innovation , not quite as important , but still a big issue . # ME: we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost , that's one thing we could look at . # ME: There are other aspects like L_C_D_ screens and speech recognition which weren't I don't think , in my personal opinion , gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them . # ME: I think we're better doing something basic like this which is very important and very will be a really cool feature to put in . # ME: And use . I had no real specific ideas for this , maybe we just , the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe , by themselves , # PM: maybe Matthew can give some more information on the # ME: and then th the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate . # ME: Yep and that's the presentation . # PM: Okay good , that's very clear . # ME: does anyone have any comments or ideas on that ? # PM: Maybe we yes well we maybe can decide later on the l the look and feel it was a good idea maybe to # ID: To let the people choose , you mean ? # PM: Yes the there are changeable covers , but on the other hand I don't know whether my superiors would be so glad with it because you have to introduce a complete uh new l line of supplies it would be very complicated organisational # ME: we're selling so many units of this . # ME: This is gonna be a mass marketed product , we can afford to have two or three different designs at least . # ID: a range of , a set of three , four different aspects . # ID: Sure that fits the # PM: and of course it will be a we get a if it works we can get after-sales I mean that would be very good I mean those covers could go for three , five Euro . # PM: That's a very good idea And then maybe we can go a th Matthew's presentation because # UI: then we could discuss later we can put all ideas together . # PM: Together indeed , # UI: It should be easier with that . # PM: because you ma might have some information on the easy to use , # PM: what you were already mentioning . # ID: And your part is very related to mine because when you suggest something then it has to be integrated inside . # UI: I'll go with that actually Okay so m so then the idea of having a remote is generally you have different keys and different structures , different forms , and they could be like buttons and they could be of a varying sizes if you want to basically emphasize a particular key more than the other , and maybe like you can have different colours for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button . # UI: So this is the general trend to ha the method they do . # UI: So what I have found was that currently the they are mostly that the T_V_ , V_C_R_ , music system operated ones actually , and they are very specific to each other , but there are some common keys for example if you want to follow the V_C_R_ and if you want to follow the g s some soundtrack on the w see they have the common thing actually you can have There is also a speech recognition to store channel information , names , You can basically if you have a multiple functionality , say T_V_ , V_C_R_ or something I say it to the T_V_ and the T_V_ , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information . # ME: I like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like B_B_C_ , rather than having to remember the number of it on the keypad . # ME: That's a good idea . # UI: so you can just because as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v exact channel numbers ex exactly , even if you arrange it by however you arrange it , you still have the problem to remember exactly which channel you want to # ME: Mm . I really like that idea . # ID: what functionalities do you suggest for that ? For facing this problem ? # UI: it it's like it limited one . # UI: In the present market I saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing , eighty word , which shouldn't be th that difficult to implement , like eighty to hundred word . # UI: Basically you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control , you want to st store your favourite channel . # ME: Maybe ten channels , at the most . # UI: some ten twelve channel information . # UI: You know you don't want to st store all the hundred channel information into that . # UI: And basically it depends like the remote with L_C_D_ display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie , and uh you are having a universal remote control and you want to you don't know really which functionality is now , so I am using the T_V_ so every time I use it , it could be like , for example I can use a simple toggle switch , and a display , so I press it so the display says , okay , I'm in T_V_ or D_V_D_ or whatever it is , instead of having three keys separately for four keys , # UI: to model the functionalities will increase actually , and for you and you might want you don't want separate keys for all of them . # UI: And well there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they are not allowed to browse certain channels which you can block them , and you can operate them . # UI: So these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present . # UI: I personally would look at things like having a u universal remote , is a good idea , instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having , with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition . # UI: I got a mail from the coffee machine interface unit that they have integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine , and so if you say hello coffee machine , it say hi Joe , or something like that , you know , and # ME: But a coffee machine , there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a it's a small vocabulary . # UI: you won't be using it , so it's a limited vocabulary mm thing , and very isolated word and it's it is interesting , and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys , on the display for the browsing which is again and maybe having something like a blinking thing , like it could indicate you're it could indicate what is cal like the whether you have enough battery in your in your remote , the blinking . # UI: At the same time , if it's a dark room , it can be used to locate the remote also # ID: And you want coming back to one point # ME: Two thirty five supposed to finish . # ID: y you want to let the user to programming the keys ? Some of them ? # UI: you can let them to do that . # ID: And isn't that too difficult for the we want w I don't know if we still want the R_C_ to be easy to use , that's the compromise . # UI: but the if you give it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put . # UI: Like for example I would like to store in certain way , so if you want to give the full freedom to the user or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with that constraint . # ME: I think you can do it both ways . # ME: You can have it so it's easy they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it , # ME: or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features . # PM: but I do maybe you can give a hand to us because I I'm not sure whether that we can implement that for twelve Euro and fifty cents . # PM: I'm sorry to have Every time I have to come down on this price again so this might be a little limiting for your creativity , but it's the real We have to consider it . # PM: do we think these ideas an and my sp speech recognition , I mean maybe it's possible for twelve Euro but then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the uh the furry case of the # ID: I would say that for programming keys , you said , it could be easily done within the package of twel twelve Euros , but for the A_S_R_ system , I'm not sure if it's feasible to have this # UI: We well we can still look at we can talk with the coffee unit and you can check how much how much they # ID: Exactly i if it's a low vocabulary it's already implemented , and w how much it's cost , maybe with a f cheap chip . # UI: Maybe we can come we can talk to them , and we can come with that , you know . # UI: And also well you can think of having since you have a you know something maybe if you added little bit of display , you might need the to che keep checking the battery , so you really need a some kind of indicator , so it could be a blinking option of L_E_D_ it could actually be used to detect also . # UI: If it's in a dark room you can basically detect it also . # ME: I like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark , so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them or if they if they light up or something . # UI: actually i if i it is like you know it tells you , it can be for two purposes , like if you have an L_C_D_ display and all those things it's not going to be the standard remote , which is having which need just six volt th sorry three volts of D_C_ . # UI: It may need more actually , so y you may need to check your battery usage and then you need that , some functionality to indicate the battery limit . # UI: And then if the battery limit is indicated , if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something # UI: and it can change the colour depending on your how much is the battery , that is good enough to even locate even if you want to . # ID: I don't know how if I have time to talk about the # UI: You you have time some more ? # PM: Yes yes you can you can still . We have time . # UI: Sure you can you know . # ID: what I'm gonna present here is very basic knowledge about the all the components that are inside a R_C_ a remote control , and how is it manufactured h what is the process , just to explain you . # ID: the method is ther there is a set of components in a in a remote control like , and what cost the components in themself do not cost a lot but the way to assemble everything costs obviously , and I will show you my preferences uh at the end . # ID: there are two different types of Two different ways of using the components for making a remote control . # ID: the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some transistors with an that aims at communicating uh the message and to send the message to the to the led that will transmit to the receiver . # ID: the other components and the circuit board buttons , infrared , led , etcetera , for the components you finding , just to say that the chip can detect when a key is pressed , and then it translate to the key , to a sequence , something like morse code , as you know , with a different sequence for each key , with the components we will use , we will have different messages , different sequences , and the chips sends that signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger electronic parts are assembled onto printed boards because it's easier to mass produce and assemble . # ID: I think for our design we want some b programmable you know V_ V_L_S_I_ or F_P_G_A_ high technology , and this is important , and also we'll use like in any high-tech devices a chip of fi fibreglass to them and connect them . # ID: my personal design we need to find a solution what is the material of the cover we want to use . # ID: If it's plastic or you said that you had some ideas like fruit , veg or # PM: m maybe m maybe we can give the case a very uh normal a v very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up . # PM: So like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in , for instance , a wooden case . # ME: Mm just have a # ID: like they do in with cars I think . inside the car # ME: Just the veneer on it , # ID: they also emailed me that they have available a bunch of different buttons , a scroll wheels , integrated push buttons s such as a computer mouse . And very cheap L_C_D_s , so liquid crystal displays , so I'm wondering , I think we might be able to integrate L_C_D_ into our R_C_ . # ID: And the final point okay is we have there are some compromise to do . # ID: we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip , but the scroll wheel and that kind of higher high-tech stuff needs more money which is a higher price range alright . # ID: And the display requires an advanced chip , which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip , but I think with twelve Euros and if it's uh made for mm four million items , then I think w we could be able to handle that . # ID: to sum up we need I just said that the components the list of components has to be listed and assembly is a an important process that has to be taken into account . # ID: And for the designing of the cove uh cover layout then it's better to maybe see that with the U_R_ exp U_R_I_ Expert so that we can it's really a team-working I cannot design something without your agreement , # UI: of course for example I wanted to know like if you want to have a fo if you want to have the L_C_D_ display over there , or if you want to store a programmes with a keys What kind of things you'll need inside your thin inside W wh what # ID: it's kind of simple pro progra programmable device , and we have to insert . # ID: I think we could insert one that could underlie several functions # UI: Okay so in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the card . # ID: Exactly , for customizing and . # UI: where they do all the wi with them actually . # UI: How f cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things . # PM: I think we should come to some decisions now a about this . # PM: I understand when we want a display we need a expensive chip , but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip , so can we use same chip , so with one expensive chip we can implement several complicated or advanced features . # ID: Exactly that's a very good idea , we could have one main chip that could handle , it's called F_P_G_A_ chip , that could handle both like scrolling wheels as well as L_C_D_ # PM: when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is possible in the in the given budget , maybe we should go for the more expensive chip , so all features which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip . # PM: Do you think that's feasible ? # UI: I don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five Euro you know . # PM: You th you think it's possible . # UI: Is it possible to fit in to that ? # ID: also thinking , I think both if we had a budget of twenty Euros , it will be okay , # ME: maybe we need specific costings then . # ME: Actually do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better . # ID: that's an excellent idea . # PM: wh when you make a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price . # PM: That w that would be a very good idea . # ID: because right now I don't have price in head but for next meeting I'm sure be able to do that . # UI: that's something which I wanted to ask you also , like what will be the each individually the cost of it . # UI: For example if f if you want to put wood I wouldn't suggest for wood 'cause it's I think it's m much easier to use a plastic or a rubber rather than wood . # ID: I agree on that . # UI: It will be much ch much expensive th though it's the most natural thing , # PM: but I can I think I think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition , and then people can fancy it up with more expensive materials which come with a with another price . # UI: we can give a preference to them , but it is but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is it's much better with that rather than going for # PM: Do do you agree ? # ID: but i it's a detailed yeah plastic versus wood , and we need maybe to centre our description on the really the what buttons what functionality we want to offer to the user , and maybe with graphs or I don't know User Interface Designer you could maybe help us on that . # PM: I think for next meeting we c you two can present a real design . so drawing it on the board . # PM: And then we now sh only have to t to decide the general function . # PM: Let let's say next meeting w you produce two designs , one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price . # PM: furthermore we go for the for the basic plastic case which can be later fancied up with addit additional , how do you call them , these like mobile telephones you can put a cover over it . # PM: But that can be done later . # PM: We now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control . # UI: We can give them smooth keys , you know . # UI: Smooth keys with bigger s So that you know The the problem most of the time we've seen , the keys is that it's small , and every time we have to be very but if i the if we if we go to a different ways of designing those keys , then you can merge them together # ME: is there any of these that you're looking at particularly or is this just ideas ? # UI: you can actually , for example , if you see , they are they are they are quite small over here , and now you can , for example , as I was if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people . # UI: At the same time , it is m more like it would be more interesting for people who are having this R_S_I_ and all problem . # PM: Yes yes bi big keys is good thing I think . # UI: big keys may better for them actually and # ID: I agree , and not too m too many keys of course . # ME: Mm well one I've had before , a r remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom so the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , and then you can slide the cover back to get to the more advanced keys . # PM: Mm w but then you have still have when you don't use it you have such a an extent of your remote control which you don't use . # PM: So maybe it's possible , I don't know whether you can indicate this , that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are buttons you don't use that much . # ME: I've seen that before too . # ME: Anoth another like b it flips up and then you've got another layer of buttons underneath . # UI: so it's something like this , the model here s you can put the keys # ME: But I've seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as well . # ID: That's what you mean ? # PM: Yes I th that's what I mean so I mean something like a book . # ME: I like this one . I like the shape of this one . # ME: Can we have can we think about maybe having a non-recta non non-rectangular one , so with not just the straight little box # ID: I like also this one . # ME: that's a maybe curved or something . # ID: the point is w maybe we need to also to make a decision on how big we want to be and how many buttons like n we should dec decide numbers or # ME: Is this for the next meeting though ? # UI: We should make a # ME: I think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting . # UI: that next meeting we should be # PM: Ju just make two designs , # UI: that would depend upon us actually . # PM: and the we can decide between th those designs . # PM: I think that would be a good idea . # PM: anyone any questions for now ? # UI: No no . I don't have . # ME: is this is there anything else I need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting ? # PM: I come to that uh # UI: Maybe it would be interesting if you could look for the cost inventories of other devices , if you're using speech recognition or something like that . # PM: Yes well m maybe , I don't know whether that's possible , maybe you can start evaluating their work somehow . # ME: is this me designing a way to evaluate it Thinking about how to set up test groups and things ? # PM: I don't know whether that's possible in the given time but a as far as possible . # PM: you two will be together w working on a o on two prototypes # PM: and further instructions will be will be sent to you by email . # ID: Two or three prototypes ? # UI: One for like cost and the one with like higher-end # UI: so that then we can be easily comparing them or you know find a compromise between both of them , # ID: and find maybe a compromise . # UI: that's how it is . # PM: let's call this to an end . # UI: we are done for now .
# ME: Did you get my email with the slides ? # ID: I guess I have to change the pen otherwise . Will be completely different . # ME: Maybe they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . # ME: Might be seat floor rather than person . # ID: And do you think it's . # ME: Jo's making faces at me . # PM: Matthew is late again . # PM: Probably an important man . # PM: So well it is important for him to be here . # ID: So what can you ? # PM: You did work together didn't you ? # ID: we will , so I will be able to summarize our meeting , but still I think it would be in very important if the as main designer . I think we can put on the here . # ID: basically w we designed the two items . # ID: can we have a phone , # PM: Yes , maybe we should phone him . # ID: it's really w well designed . # ME: Mm , object tracking . # PM: when he is not here we will just we just have to continue . # PM: just for record I will take notes again . # PM: And well first thing I was uh I got an email from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the twelve Euro and fifty cents . # PM: when you stay in it's good , when you don't stay in you have to redesign . # PM: There is no negotiation possible in this matter . # PM: So we have to consider that . # PM: maybe Anna , you can have your presentation . # ME: we can't no we can't do evaluation 'til we have a design . # PM: Matthew . Nice you are here . # PM: ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your designs . # ID: I will start by the basic one that fits into eight Euros actually , right , seven eight Euros , and well first for both they have a special shape , maybe the designer can explain better than me , but it's like a surf board . # ID: And you are supposed to surf to browse to surf T_V_ , maybe the web , and it's kind of interesting shape because unconsciously people want to s to surf when they see this stuff . # ID: And also it's not too far from a mobile . # ID: So people are used to that kind of shape , Don't take care too much about the colour because w we don't take # UI: Now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now . # ID: here would be basically the infrared uh led L_A_ L_E_D_ , the on-off button , in red . # ID: Here would be the volume . On the on the left , okay , so easy to turn on t and off . # ID: this is a very cheap version so there are maybe you can carry on Matthew . # UI: Also so you have uh browsing the channels , actually so you can go up and down the channels , if you have a video or something you can forward , back . # ID: How can you change from V_C_R_ to T_V_ , by the way ? # UI: no , this is a single this is a model with just the T_V_ one . # UI: this is a standard T_V_ one , we are not talking about that . # UI: and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits . # UI: The extra two are for having or giving an option for having more than one channel . # UI: And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that . Actually . # ME: Okay so it's t a very basic remote then , it's only # UI: It's a very basic minimal thing which you can which is which is also available in the market , actually that's what it that it i and would cost us to build it about eight Euros . # ID: Seven , eight , ei eight Euros . # PM: Exce except for the for the special shape , the surfing board , it has a quite a conventional layout of buttons . # UI: this one model # ME: I like the volume control , that's good . # UI: Th this is a magic one but I know we don't want to talk about that , you know like i it is a very futuristic , it's like it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future , it can come . # ME: So it doesn't actually have buttons . # UI: So that then what we look t # ME: Did you wanna see ? # PM: you can carry on , # UI: This is a model , # PM: I just look how it feels all . # PM: Yes it really feels like a mobile phone . # PM: I really want to talk to it . # ME: It won't talk back . # PM: but continue with your # UI: so well then the this is the a more a little smooth and it gives a lot of functionality , in this way , so all we have th you see there are only six keys , but don't worry they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here . # UI: And so they have more space actually and it's easy to use this and you have this is a standard infrared eye , and then you have a power button , which l volume , what you have , and then other than that you have channel up and down and f slow pause or s slow lo # UI: s pause or stop , and then you can you have a L_C_D_ display , here and y this is a functional thing which can change it's a toggle switch which could change the function say , y you press it # PM: From D_V_D_ player to television or something . # ID: Exactly . To audio and to video on demand . # UI: . I really can change it , Instead of having many switches , y # PM: and then you get feedback via the L_C_D_ # UI: The L_C_D_ can display what is that on that , and well you can have a integrated microphone over here , # ID: This is the orange button , the microphone . # UI: or in the button th here , so which can basically you want to do a speech recognition and that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the on your on your display . # UI: And here is a small L_E_D_ which is like blinking one , which tells you like are you running out of the battery , and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier okay . And well then we have a cover basically , basically you don't need much of the time this , when you need you can use it , and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing to this cover # ID: Crazy dis designer , # UI: Design enter . # PM: but i in there when this is closed , will it also cover up the L_C_D_ screen ? # UI: It's basically to do that . # PM: But but the L_C_D_ screen I mean is a very well an eye-attracting feature which shouldn't be shouldn't be # UI: Actually when you are watching the T_V_ , when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here , # ID: Oh actually well . # PM: That th that's true . # UI: you know , you want to and this gives a protection to the L_C_D_ actually , giving a cover to that actually . Gives a protection because when it falls down or something it is it is it gives a protec # PM: Yes . Yes , more robust . # UI: it's more robust that way . # UI: And you have very good chances # ID: It's low weight . You have to see yeah the components we put inside is very low weight . # ID: So the cost is actually a bit more , it's sixteen Francs . # UI: Sixteen Euros . # ID: Sixteen Euros # ME: So it's well outside the budget then . # ID: Then it's out of budget . # ID: But the main point we talk about that with our manufacturer . # ID: And they say basically that the S_R_ system would be something like three Francs per item # ME: That's on top of the sixteen , or is it part of that ? # ID: No no , part of that , . # ME: So that takes it down to thirteen Euros without the speech recognition . # UI: if you we can have if you have new more ideas we can add new more some more keys if you want to you know # ID: I think th we should stick with a number of keys because if we add too much then it's too # UI: it should not be cluttering up everything . # ME: What's this one on the side ? # UI: that's for the it's kind of a L_E_D_ for indicating your battery # ID: Locati . Location . # UI: and as well as it's like a blinking one you know you can keep it aside . # ME: I like the shape of them , I do like the size and the shape . # PM: Be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible , maybe Anna you can give our give us your # ME: And maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products , both of these two . # PM: Yes . Evalua evaluation and also the evaluation criteria , so what is important to look at . # ME: Basically this is what we've talked about already , from the marketing point of view . # ME: We just wanna make sure that we've taken into account # PM: just do it quickly if we al already . # ME: it's just a shortlist of criteria on the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product . # ME: we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that , so just average the score of those items , These are the things we identified as being important . # ME: the three things were look and feel , innovation and ease of use , were the three important components appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic . # ME: And then goin following the company motto , following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well . # ME: So well do you wanna go through and put through those on the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them ? # PM: why not why not discuss it now , # ME: just go through onto the whiteboard I guess . # ME: Not sure how this is gonna come out . # ME: the first one was really very far below budget , would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it ? # ME: 'Cause if we're only going to make it for eight Euros then we have a # PM: Mm , well my personal view is w when this one is eight Euros we must think how can we improve it . # PM: And then I mean w you must just see it we can still spend this four and a half Euro and to r because th the selling price is already prite fik uh quite fixed on twenty five Euros so we just have to offer as much as well value for the for the customer he can have for twenty five Euro . # ID: Functionality . # ME: Okay so look and feel , innovation # UI: And now it easy to use . # ME: you following the idea of using the removable covers on these ? # ME: Is that part of both of them or ? # PM: w we can still discuss that . # PM: and together with evaluating this we might come with new ideas I mean adding things or removing of options because they are too expensive , I've received a framework which we can do this . # PM: I mean did you have this Excel sheet ? # PM: No okay , this is these are the latest prices of our production uh production unit for several components , so we can see whether the price is within the twelve Euro fifty cents . # PM: maybe we can start with this , calling this one . # PM: Th th this is the first design . # ME: And the other one's green . # ME: Okay , so look and feel ? # ME: Where one is I've broken the pen again . # PM: there is another pen . # ME: w one's bad and seven's the best . # ME: one's true and seven's false . # ME: One's the best . # ME: So on a scale of one to seven ? # PM: Look and feel . # PM: you already feel that pretty much I think . # PM: In i in my opinion purely feel is very good , is very good in your hand , so I would consider two or may maybe even one for feel . # PM: But that's just half , we should also consider look , and then i it looks quite conventional . # PM: Don't you agree ? # ME: On the scale u it's between functional and fancy basically we're looking at , # PM: Ma ma maybe say five It's my opinion , but I don't know what # UI: I will give it maybe we have anyways the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say you know . # UI: though the look is fine but still I will give four in that case # PM: Now we th then we settle on four . # PM: Can you maybe fix the other # ID: If you press like this not like this then you # ME: that's the ink's dried . # UI: C can you get the batteries ? # UI: the battery has fallen down , # ME: Battery's low , isn't it the ink ? # ME: that's the that one ? # ME: battery there . # UI: No no it's not that , it's how to close a battery . # UI: Now it should be . # ME: I think it's lost a battery . # PM: Mm , try it , just try it . # ME: It would still write # PM: Oh it will not # ME: but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors . # UI: Is there another battery there ? # ME: You got a second ? # ME: we won't be able to tell . # ME: Is that working ? # ME: Did it come out ? # ME: Because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working , it's just a normal whiteboard marker but it wouldn't be picked up on the actual whiteboard . # ME: And the other one ? # ME: I think it's slightly better , it's hard to tell from just the plasticine , # PM: When we want to include I I'm doubting about this component . # PM: It it breaks in your # UI: actually this is this is not going to protrude actually , it it's n i it is jus # ID: It's not a button it's a led , # UI: It's a led actually which 'll be covering in a curve # ID: Ac actually it should be embedded . # PM: Mm , yes I see , mm okay . # UI: It's will be embedded there so it won't be really you know protruding or something . # ID: you can push it again , you can push it . # ME: The other thing is , is the left hand one protruding ? # ME: 'Cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand , maybe it won't work so well . # UI: No you it not protruding actually , it will go in better into that # ME: I'd say two or three for that one , personally . # ME: Probably more towards three than two . # PM: I think the look is better but the feel is worse . # PM: So so I would also say this is four . # PM: But w do you what do you think ? # UI: it's fine I think . # UI: My just that the feel is that you right now you don't see the feel because right for example if you press it quite inside now like this , now it's embedded one . # UI: This is how embedded one will # PM: it basically is the same shape . # UI: It's a bas basically the same thing actually . # UI: You will be Except that in this c # ID: And the L_C_D_ makes it better . # UI: And you might have a slight thing for to forward and # ID: So I will say two . # ME: it's d it's definitely more fancier than that one . # ID: I would say two , three . # UI: looking like # ME: The first one , not really muc # ID: Basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market , # UI: No but except for the design of the surf . # ID: The surf design . # ME: What features are we actually including ? # UI: You should be rea # ME: Are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it ? # ME: There's nothing like that ? # UI: I think it's more of the feel . # ME: But th is there any there's no actual innovation in that at all , it's just a straight-out remote control . # PM: The only innova innovation is the shape . # UI: Say about that . # ME: there's no this look and feel thing , though that's not a technological innovation . # ME: So I'd be up for seven for innovation . # ID: And the And the second one is really state of the art , in terms of innovation . # ID: And with many more functionalities , and can open and close the bottom part . # PM: A and the L_C_D_ screen is That's that's well it's quite innovative . # ID: And all the scrolling buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this . # ID: could put it at one or two I would say . Personally . # ME: So what is it , what are the innovations with this ? # ME: Got the L_C_D_ screen . # ID: automatic speech recognition . # ME: Is that in this one though ? # ME: Is this 'cause this is the Th th there were different options we discussed then , we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget . # PM: We just diske discuss it as you designed it and then we will try to get it in the budget . # ME: So the cost for these were what was the cost for the first one ? Eight Euros ? # ID: actually we have to check again . # ME: And this one was sixteen Euros . # UI: Sixteen Euros . # ME: Innovation for this one is two ? One ? # UI: It's a two , I would say two . # ID: W un to be one what would do we nee actually , I don't see # ID: one would be without buttons , . # ME: Mm . Well the speech recognition is a very good innovation I believe it , # ID: So maybe we can put one . # PM: This this is it w with the speech recognition ? # ID: It's using speech recognition , . # PM: Gi given that it works , # PM: then it's I think one . # ID: the first one is really standard , so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it , # UI: He is used to it act They are used to it actually . # ME: So that's maybe a two for ease of use . # UI: Here there may # ID: , the other one is quite easy , tho though . # UI: , though it has more functionality I think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually . It shouldn't be diffi # ME: So maybe a three or a four . # UI: actually in fact I think it will be # ID: One me we hope maybe sometimes people get scared with the number of buttons . # ID: And there is a I would say three . Or maybe four . # ME: Consensus ? Three or four ? # UI: we have reduced the keys actually you see . # PM: Three , I would . Three . # UI: Three is fine with me . # ID: because it's n it's not like a big one with one hundred buttons or so , # UI: actually the user has to put some effort to do use that actually , it's not so easy , like this one the normal . # PM: but then when he is used to it , i it is quite easy . # UI: Is quite easy . # PM: So so I think th three is good . # UI: Initially there is a lot of effort , . # PM: What's the next ? # ME: how well it goes to the target demographic . # ME: we're d we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds ? # PM: Twe twenty to forty , yes that's # ID: This one would be for grandmothers . # UI: this would I would I would give this model to the old people actually . # ID: grandmothers , # ME: So sh completely changed our demographic there , it's not part of the funky young thing . # PM: exce except for the surfing shape . I mean that's something which has an appeal on this group I think , # ME: If it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then I can imagine it being applying to the demographic That's it's still Ye # PM: Mm w we after this we can consider for instance , making this more attractive to the demographic # ME: 'Cause we have got room , we've got some budget there to add a few things to it , that's right . # PM: But as it is now , I w would say mm , six , something . # ID: because it's so important it's i it was written that it really so important , the look and taking care of its it targets , the right range of people , # UI: I think but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap , actually . # ME: But it's going to be cheap whatever though , it was set with i we've got a set price . # UI: And people can still decide to use the cheaper one instead of a # ID: But for us it's we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five Euros . # ME: There's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few Euros on that one rather than another one . # PM: Ju just think , twenty five Euros , I mean it's not going to be cheaper . # UI: So in that case well it's fine then . # ME: and the demokraphi demographic of the second one ? # UI: And the demographics of # ME: It's got the got the toys in it , it's got the L_C_D_ screen # PM: tha that's I think it's better , because of the L_C_D_ screen which is really an appeal on the on the on the on the and on the # ID: And if you want to target if we wish to sell four millions of this , I think for this audience we need absolutely the L_C_D_ screen . # PM: the L_C_D_ screen attracts , # ME: I think especially if we're gonna n have an L_C_D_ screen on a low range product then that's good . # PM: Because it Mm , ma maybe that's something to consider , yes , # ME: I'd probably go with three again for that one . # UI: I think it's it has more market actually . # ID: Or even Even one and two . Or two . # UI: Y , you know Because tomorrow this will be more appealing because you can add lot of sophistication on that . # UI: Because then you have it d you have lot of things which you can include # ME: And especially I guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well , # UI: for the people to # ME: and that makes it more appealing , it's more of a new fun toy . # UI: We have to practically test it . # UI: The field test will tell you how good . # PM: the final point , trends . # ME: And following the trends . # ME: the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel . # ME: as it is , not really doing either of them . # ID: Spongy , that means that it goes in the water . # ME: the spongy could be part of the feel of the buttons as well , I know some have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons not exactly spongy but I'm thinking one of the Nokias that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons it's got just a one bit on it and so you can that feels kinda spongy . # ID: But this one includes this feature , right ? Spongy buttons . # ME: So it's sort of , . # UI: We we , it's the way they are going to be , actually . # ID: the maybe in the colour we can make it fruit and veggie . # ME: But that's if you're using the covers . # PM: And the then we can al # ME: Or is it just one # PM: We can we can consider uh is it possible do you think , to make a cover for s such a phone ? # ME: they make it for mobiles , it can't be that much more complicated . # UI: But why do you want to cover that actually ? # UI: In that w in the mod # PM: just with the with the flexible plastic # ME: So you got the option of having different colours or different textures . # ID: This is possible . # PM: I th I th I think # UI: y are you sure ? # UI: I think it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone , . # PM: O o or just two things which can be put on each other . # ID: exactly like Nokia phones . # PM: Yes , exactly like it . # PM: Maybe we can but we have to decide it , we can put the fancy f look of vegetables for instance , to these covers and s now try to invest in the in the features . # ME: I think the if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in electronics , it lets people have the latest fashion even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out , you'll still be able to put a new cover on it and then it'll still be in fashion . # ID: 'Cause sometimes look at this computer , th this laptop , it's all black , and it's quite conventional , and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here . # ID: So maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one , very standard one , that meets the requirements of th such people that want really standard things . # ME: And then you have the option of having the different colours , different covers . # PM: So so that would make the trends equal , so we really have don't have , # ME: Mm . There's n 'Cause that's the that's the feature that could be included in either of them . # ME: Although it is more with the spongy buttons on the on the other one . # ID: so a point better for the for the number two . # ME: Two and three , or one and two ? # PM: Say , say one and two . One and two . # PM: this one has spongy but buttons ? # ID: , the blue one spongy . # PM: Mm , I see , yes okay . Good . # ME: Okay so the average of that is three six nine divided by five , so five mm nine by five , one point s eight ? # PM: Three , six , seven . # UI: One point six , one point One point eight . # ME: This one , eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one , divided by five is four point two # UI: Four point four point two . # ME: But we still got a very different price for those two so they're not really comparable yet anyway . # PM: We we must try to get them closer . # ID: , it's right , that's right . # PM: Both in i or we just have to choose . And adapt . # PM: Because , when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap . # ME: it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out . # ME: That'll basically take us down to the budget . # PM: did y did you work with the same prices that I have here ? # ID: I give I just give a call with the manufacturer and I explained them and they told me this could be possible for sixteen Fr Euros . # ID: unfortunately we didn't see this chip , Matthew , so maybe we have to recap with this one . # UI: Maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this , . # PM: Well yes , well re reconsider it . # PM: let's try to model this phone in this sheet , what kind of energy source we didn't speak about that . # PM: It's a it's a normal battery , or # UI: it migh It it'll need more than a conventional one , it won't be just maybe you might use a A_A_ battery actually . # UI: What do you say , Mael ? # ID: For this one it's a normal battery . # PM: Yes . Just so one battery . 'Kay . # PM: Electronics . # PM: given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip . # ID: sample speaker , . # PM: or sample sensor , yes . # ID: Sample , this one . # PM: Yes , this one . Okay . # UI: Curved . Double curved # PM: Double curve . # ME: it's gonna be more than just the biggest case , definitely . # ID: which one are we talking to ? # UI: Are you talking about this or that ? # ME: Either of them . # PM: yes , we are talking about , but they have the same shape , # ME: Mm . They're both going to be not basic cases . # PM: but , actually bu th this would be double curves ? # PM: , plastic would be the material . # ME: The basic one , yep . # ID: Is it zero Franc ? # UI: A special colour ? # PM: special colour , now we leave it to the covers . # ME: now we're either going button or L_C_D_s , L_C_D_ display . # ID: It's okay . Just say L_C_D_ . # ME: Is that price per unit , or for the whole thing ? # PM: now this is per unit , this number of components . # ME: So it would need twelve buttons . # UI: we might need a scroll wheel , right , for that ? # ID: but for this one it's twelve Euro . # UI: No , for that one also . # ID: There are twelve ? # PM: one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , # UI: that's a scroll . # PM: Yes . Twelve I believe . # PM: So this comes to eighteen . # ME: And that's without any special button supplements . # UI: one scroll wheel you might need . # ME: we'd have a special colour , special form and special material on all of them . # ME: They're not just standard buttons . # PM: I think but th do you agree th that thi # ID: Wait a minute , it's not it's not double curved , it's single curved , Because it's there is no like . # ME: But I thought it would be curved on two it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well , that's what I thought . # PM: I'm no I'm no I'm not sh sure . # PM: Yes I kno undes I understand what you mean , yes . # ID: you know this curve like this so , it's w there is only is there is nothing like y you know in the other stuff there are # ME: You talking about concave curves ? # ID: So I think we can put # ME: You think a single curved ? # ID: the single curved in the sixteen . # ID: That makes seventeen . # ID: And what are just The bt buttons , we have twelve buttons , are you sure ? # ME: We have more , we've got those the scroll wheel on the side # ID: I had a bad estimation . # UI: Bad estimate , # PM: we have we haven't talk about a , but that's no a is very exp inexpensive I believe but it is not in the list . # ME: We've got a scroll wheel for the volume don't we , or is it some other thing that's not on there . # PM: is this a scroll wheel or is this a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides so for higher and lower ? # ME: we've only got five minutes left guys so we need to wrap it up pretty fast . # ID: Yes , a kind of scroll wheel . # ME: this is even more than the than the cost you gave , the sixteen Euros . # ID: so based on that , where is the es okay sample speaker # UI: That is the sample sensor and sample speaker . # UI: We just need that actually . We need one . # PM: We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip , but then we can't have the speech recognition , yes ? Yes ? # PM: w when we w a this would this would be cutting the speech recognition . # ID: But the but if you have the near the L_C_D_ you can choose select between you know like uni universal between audio , T_V_ and V_C_R_ , and this needs a needs a advanced chip . # ID: Right , Matthew ? # ID: Or regular chip ? # UI: I think it's going to be y # ID: I think regular , today we you can do that with regular chip . # UI: it's th with the regular chip , . # PM: Say say it's regular , regular chip , # PM: and we still on fifteen , # ID: And what about the number of buttons my Matthew ? # PM: Yes but that maybe we can just say # ID: When you look at this w , this u item , # PM: Ca l we are just when we just want to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to fit in twelve fifty . # PM: So is it possible ? # ME: But that's seven basic buttons right , seven buttons without any adds-on , without special colours or form or material . # UI: That'll be then we have to ask the user to press it several times . # ID: You cannot make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really low , # ME: the L_C_D_ display is three Francs , sorry three Euros , by itself . # ID: And we don't want to change that We we really want a L_C_D_ other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market . # PM: Otherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal thing like this . # ME: twelve Euro fifty , we got two off of the battery , # ME: we can't do anything about that , so ten fifty , if we want an L_C_D_ dispra display , that's seven fifty , so we've got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons . And the chip . # ME: the chip's up there already . # ME: So we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget , there's no doubt about that . # ID: So wha what each of us think about the because it's measure point the L_C_D_ , Do you think it's important ? # UI: Or we could even replace them by buttons actually . # ID: Because sometimes whe when you watch the T_V_ in fact , you have a big display and maybe you don't need one more in your hands ? # ID: I dunno , I'm just asking . # UI: A actually it depends , it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it , for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , or and you'll have L_C_D_ display which is that is going to bring the cost by two Euros at least . # ME: I think , unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display . # UI: Okay so we can get rid of it # UI: and then add a couple of buttons . # ID: But , do we want that ? # ID: On the market point of view , . What do you think , L_C_D_ is a major feature , or ? # ME: For the price , it's gonna be what we can afford , and it's looking like we can't afford the L_C_D_ display , there's no way we can get it in there . # PM: I think we have to come to a decision now , just I think we what we just do i is vote about the L_C_D_ display # ID: You assume , you want a democratic voyt vote , # PM: One man one vote . # PM: S so who thinks the L_C_D_ disply display should be i should be in it ? # ME: I th I'd like t it to be in but I can't see it happening . I can't see it fitting in . # ME: Bu y you're a power voter veto anyway as Project Manager . # UI: but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that . # ME: we have to make a decision now , that's it . # PM: having an L_C_D_ s display is just uh have very limited amount of buttons . # PM: Is that acceptable ? # PM: Ca can I have can the functions be implement in an You've you agree . # PM: So hav having seven buttons , instead of twelve . # PM: So that wou would be cutting suh say about these buttons . # ID: Because one show me that actually we could in fact we move these three buttons and have three possibilities for each of the three here . Here one , at the middle , and at the bottom . # ME: Mm . I think then we we're really losing ease of use . # UI: That will create another problem . For the people to use it . # UI: It's not going to be easy . Doing that . # PM: I think we should we should cut the L_C_D_ screen . That that's my opinion . # UI: it's okay , you cut the L_C_D_ screen and introduce two more buttons . # ME: Okay . So L_C_D_'s out , is speech rec out now ? # ID: The speech recognition is out . Because of the budget , . # PM: where , L_C_ w we now we can just # ME: are we basically back to the original one now , back to the first version ? # ME: Which turns out to be on budget exactly , pretty much . With these new costings . # ME: just look at forget that one and look at that one now . # PM: Yes . Yes . I th I th I think w we just go for this one and that now twelve Euros is the is the price , # ME: Okay . Well that's # PM: My m my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected . # ID: Actually , we will not need the really expert designers because the amount , . # ME: w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment . # PM: Then we the same .
# UI: How do you wear this thing ? # UI: Not too many cables and stuff . # PM: Is recorded ? Okay ? # PM: Okay so welcome everyone . # PM: So we are here for the kickoff meeting of the process of designing a new remote control . # PM: So I will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff , then we will see what will be our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . # PM: And then we will discuss if we have few ideas and we will end by dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process . # UI: Just one thing . # UI: , you said twenty-five minutes , but I have something else to do , so gotta have another meeting soon , so maybe you could hurry up a bit It's true . # UI: I have another meeting so if you could # PM: You have another meeting soon ? # PM: So you have to be quick . # UI: for the lawnmower project . # PM: So the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly . # PM: So the design step will be divided in three main points . # PM: First it will be the functional design . # PM: Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design . # PM: So the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil . # PM: And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different trend in user interface and stuff like that . # PM: And then the desired devi design will consist in specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've made in the second point . # PM: So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to each of us to draw your favourite animal on the white board . # UI: What an original idea . # PM: Do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us ? # PM: Okay that's good . # UI: Can I give you the # UI: But I don't have to say anything . When I'm drawing the orangutan . # PM: If you want to react about this wonderful drawing I'll let you comment . # UI: It's an abstract drawing of an orangutan . # PM: Okay it's an abstract drawing . # PM: I think it's nice and original . # ID: You should write y the name I think . # UI: I don't have a red colour . # UI: Usually orangutans have red hair so this is a very important but I don't have red pen , so # PM: You want to draw something Christine ? # ME: You have to imagine a little bit . # PM: Of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost . # UI: Wha what is this strange beast ? # ME: Is it beautiful ? # UI: Is it a monster ? # UI: I thought these things did not exist . # ME: Yes yes is it like that . # PM: Okay it's your cat . # UI: Does have a name ? # ME: The name is Caramel . # UI: Caramel . Ah-ha . # PM: Olivier , do you want to # ID: And you I think I'm too short for the cables . # PM: Okay I go , but next time you'll do something I'm sure . # PM: I'm a bit short on cable . # UI: Next time I concentrate . # PM: Okay . So what could I draw ? # PM: Maybe I can draw like a very simplified cow . # PM: I don't know if it looks like a cow # UI: He looks like a bong . # ID: Quite squarey . # PM: I dunno it looks more like a donkey in fact I would say . # UI: I think we will be finished this # PM: Okay so I hope that it helps you in the process of designing a remote control . # UI: Is it for putting a for logos , no . # PM: So Here the financial objective of our project . # PM: That is to say to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of fifty million Euros . # UI: I is there a matter for a new remote control ? # PM: if it's trendy , original I d fulfil the user needs . # UI: Is it a single device remote control or is it a multi-device remote control ? # PM: We have to discuss that point . # UI: this is not defined at all ? # PM: you can suggest points like this . # PM: So what so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple . # PM: So what's what are your ideas about that ? # PM: Maybe I can have the your opinion from the marketing side ? # UI: Well do we sell other stuff ? # UI: if we bundle the remote control with something to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us . # PM: Okay , so if it selled by its own i it would rather be for multiple device . # PM: So maybe it should be for multiple devices . # PM: And do you have any ideas of design ideas or any uh technical requirement we should fulfil ? # ID: I think we shouldn't have too many b for my part . I think # UI: No , I couldn I cannot fi think of any requirements right now . # ID: If we don't have so many buttons could be nice . # PM: Few buttons . Okay . # PM: And do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ? # PM: Might be a good idea . # PM: And do you have any idea of the trend the trend in domain , what it shouldn't it should look like , or things like that ? # ID: Something which is not squarey maybe , not a box . # PM: With rou okay . # PM: Like for okay . # UI: Something like that , least fits in your hand . # UI: The basic requirement . # PM: So . Fit in your hand , . # PM: And also it have , i it may be it may be important for the remote control to be To , to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall . # PM: Water-proof as well . # ID: And I think we should have a device # PM: Maybe it is original because you can use it in your in your bath whereas the others can't . # PM: Maybe water-proof would be very original . # PM: Havin having a water-proof remote control so that the people can use it in their bath . # PM: That could be # UI: B it seems so , but if you don't have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of f # PM: but , it is still something you have to buy and that is not maybe very # UI: And , and that's one of the that's one of the shock I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it . # UI: That's people they actually do it themselves . # PM: But maybe we can bulk it with already this plastic thing and the waterproof stuff as well . # UI: I it will look a bulky in that case . # PM: Maybe we can sell all that together , so plastic protection and a waterproof box as well . # PM: That might be good track to follow . # UI: Like as an optional thing . # PM: Optional or selled with it ? # ID: And I think we should have something , most of the time I lose my remote control . # ID: We should have s special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping . # PM: Maybe we can have But we don't design the T_V_ . # PM: Maybe we can have something you whistle and the remote control beep . # PM: So we can have a whistle remote control ? # PM: I don't know , whistle-able ? # ID: Whistle tracking . # PM: Whistle tracking . # PM: Whistle tracking remote control . # PM: That's a good idea , that's very original and that's can improve . # UI: That's that's quite cool , but of course we you don't normally need any audio recording stuff on your remote control right ? # UI: So i it's just going to add t to the cost . # PM: but s still we have to mm we have to have an advantage over our competitors . # PM: I think this is a good advantage . # UI: I think I like the idea , but I'm not sure about the what you , # PM: . We have to ask # UI: who is giving who's giving who's giving our budget . Who's # PM: We have to ask the quest of that's design to the Industrial Designer . # PM: Okay so try to find that for next meeting . # PM: Okay . So next meeting is in thirty minutes or so . Don't pani . # PM: So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed . # PM: So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user . # PM: And also I will ask the Market Expert to try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is absolutely needed in a remote control for the user . # PM: And then I will just ask you to think about that and look at your mail because you will receive some good advice soon . # PM: Thank you I think that's all for this point . # UI: , so we come back in five minutes ? # PM: Anyway you will receive some messages . # PM: Okay , but I don't know if it is still correctly We'll see .
# PM: Okay everyone's ready . # PM: So we are here for functional design . # PM: So we are here for the functional design meeting mm so first I will show the agenda so we will I will take notes during this meeting so I will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards so then each of you will lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . # PM: Then I will present you some new project requirements I received from the management board . # PM: Then we will take the decision on the remote control needed functions and then I will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . # PM: Of the of the process . # PM: So who want to start the presentation of what they did ? # ID: F do you want to start ? # PM: You can start . # UI: Cable , camera . # PM: You have PowerPoint ? # UI: Should be in my in their folder # UI: at three I think . # PM: We have a technical problem . # UI: Do we think w s in the in the wrong folder maybe ? # UI: It is possible . # UI: It was somewhere in something like this . # UI: I don't remember the name actually must be something like messenger AMI or something . # ID: What do you have in short cut ? # ID: Participant two . # UI: maybe messenger AMI . # UI: No . There is nothing . # PM: There's no We have a technical problem . # UI: Let's go and check . # UI: I'll go and check . # ID: Otherwise , could you just describe by hand ? # ID: With the whiteboard ? # PM: If you remember but that's # UI: Basically what we want here is a remote control So the question well first of all what to control . # UI: So most people want to have a remote for their hi-fi and T_V_ and stuff like that . # UI: And but other people want th also remotes for controlling and toys like robotic pets and little robots and stuff and other people also want to have remotes for controlling whole house . # UI: so there's a project I think called X_ house or something like that does that , you can integrate your remote with computers stuff . # UI: there is one that is one thing . # UI: The other is the finder feature by whistling or whatever . # UI: if you have the finder feature then you can also have at the same time as and general voice commands if you want . # UI: So I think it should be a package in that case . # UI: so the user interface will consist of two parts . # UI: One is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part . # UI: and th the buttons part would be a set of buttons for choosing devices , a set of buttons for special navigation in space , a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access . # ID: What do you mean by linear access then ? # UI: Like a video tape goes forward , backwards , fast and stuff . # PM: Okay so special navigation , linear access , random access and there's a fourth one no ? # PM: So the better now for special navigation ? # UI: For special navigation for example you might have a T_V_ in the menu and you going to change ? # PM: Then linear access then random access . # UI: and also parameter changing . # PM: parameter okay . # UI: So if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that or maybe we could have everything generic but there are a lot of remotes on the market right now and basically this is most of the almost everybody has this stuff . # PM: and voice command did you # UI: Voice command w we could specify anything . # UI: We could assign any button a command to any button , if we have enough processing power , I guess so . # PM: So that's that close your investigations ? # PM: Maybe we can have a look at the user requirements with # ME: I dunno if you can open the # PM: I dunno if I can open it . # PM: Maybe you can s # PM: Messenger no ? # PM: In which folder ? # UI: Where did you put it ? # PM: Short-cut to AMI shared folder ? # PM: Maybe you can send it to me by email . # PM: Just to participant one . # PM: I will try to show it to everyone , that would be more comfortable . # ME: It's participant one ? # PM: this is this email . # UI: I'm designing the user interface . # PM: So maybe I can switch slides when you whenever you ask , that will be more convenient . # PM: So okay , functional requirements . # ME: Okay so you can you can go . # ME: Okay so in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects and the subjects also filled a questionnaire And here I have the results so you can see that seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly so we have to find something to make them more nice , more kind . # ME: Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy . # ME: Eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look it's not good . # PM: We can just keep doing that ? # ME: So it's not in theory but I can I can say . # ME: Fifty f seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot . # ME: So mm we have to have a remote control very out for that . # ME: the buttons have are to be uh like you say resist resisting to shocks . # ME: and fifty per cents of users say they only use ten per cents of but of the buttons in the in the remote control . # ME: So all the buttons we have to put are have to have a use a real use and not only or # PM: so fewer buttons maybe would be good ? # ME: F not many buttons , and uh u useable buttons . # UI: But what kind of remote controls did you look at ? # UI: What kind of task was it ? # ME: most for most is T_V_ . # PM: but in fact we it seems that we are going to make a T_V_ remote control according to new requirements I received from the management bo I will present them in the following . # ME: 'Kay you can go so . # ME: So there are other frustrations expressed by users , so they said they lost often the remote control in the room so they want to have a way to # ME: lot of the time they it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . # ME: So they want something s really very simple and easy to use . # ME: And remote controls are bad for # PM: What is her other side ? # UI: Other side , yo wa your wrist # UI: It i can become painful you can have tendonditis . # PM: I did not knew that . # UI: If you also up on a computer in a strange position . # PM: so you we have to make it more ergonomic . # UI: Have to say ha . # PM: It's your job got a message from Microsoft . # ME: Okay before that I have some thing to say before We know that the user use a lot their remote control to change channel . # ME: and to change volume selection of the and not a lot for setting for setting the channels and thing things like that . # ME: So it's better to put uh something very easy to set and # PM: This function should be very accessible . # ME: Very accessible yes . # PM: This is the main function okay . # ME: So then we asked some questions to them and we asked this question if they prefer an L_C_D_ screen or on their remultific function remotes control and if they mm pay more for speech recognition in remote control and you can go we have here the results of # UI: The first question . # ME: of the questions . # ME: So you know that for the younger it's very important # PM: To have L_C_D_ and voice . # ME: to have the and speech recognition . # ME: And and the others is not so important but we know that uh people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch a lot T_V_ and who wh can use a lot this . # ME: So maybe we can have a speech recognition in . # PM: maybe this is important . # PM: Moreover th maybe those like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment and so we can we have to take care of that point of view I think # ME: Okay and if there is th the conclusion now . # ME: So as we say before , I think a remote control lightening in the dark it's a good thing . # ME: not to many mud buttons like we said before , e easy to use a way to find it easily in the room and uh resistant to shock and to An I s no , . # PM: Okay these are the user requi # ME: I dunno if you see something else important or # ID: I'm just thinking of some thing . # ID: We want to have a no , I don't know if this is a good idea . # ID: We want to have a general remote control for everything . # PM: We w it seems that we no want to have a T_V_ remote control . # PM: From the management board I receive an email . # PM: Cos it would be costly and also it would take more time to develop to have a general generic remote control . # UI: I it's not true I think . # UI: The the second claim that you put . # PM: That it would be too long to develop . # UI: I think that should be the same . # PM: Because I received that email from management board and they seems to tell that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should focus on T_V_ more where it seems that the market is more important . # PM: So maybe it's a good decision . # PM: What's your opinion ? # UI: I have I've no idea I mean I should know a bit more about how fast we can design it . # ID: Finish tonight . # ID: But basically maybe I can continue with my presentation , it would be al you but I think we have some technical problem or so . # ID: So I'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control . # PM: Maybe you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do # ID: Do I have Now I have enough cables . # UI: you feel a bit like a dog with this stuff . # ID: Okay so I'm just going to describe in fact for a remote control this is quite easy . # ID: We just have I'm going # ID: I'm just going to describe . # ID: Basically we have a battery a power supply here . # ID: After that we just have user interface . # ID: Let's say that something like that , which could be a L_C_D_ let's say or an array of push button , something like that . # ID: Push button or a L_C_D_ . # ID: After that we feed that into an electronic chip . # ID: So I say U_C_ and I feed that to L_E_D_ which is infrared which is a an infrared component . # ID: And so what we for myself this for us this is quite easy . # PM: U_C_ is the central unit ? # ID: Y it's a it's this just a chip which does all the numerical # PM: Computation . # ID: numerical computation according to your display . # ID: And so for us this is quite easy . # ID: We just need to take to define what we want to do when the user interface wants something and after that we just do the coding to s and send that to the not the to the television . # ID: So for us this is quite easy . # PM: Okay so this is quite easy . # PM: There is not that much constraints . # ID: we just have to define the processing power that we need especially if we want to do some speech recognition , in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple # UI: This will think this will take more time to develop also . # ID: of course of course . # ID: but for a standard one this is really easy . # ID: It's a question of one month and so on s # PM: To have a you s you speak about with voi voice control ? # PM: Standard button one . # ID: standard remote control takes maybe one month to do that . # UI: So the only time problem is the sp voice recognition . # PM: So do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now ? # ID: I would say about eight months to have the first results . # PM: Okay so i it's a bit long . # PM: One month for the standard one with button . # PM: Even if we have a L_C_D_ display ? # ID: I mean that this is really standard devices now . # ID: For speech recognition . # PM: so we can take this into account . # PM: So who think it would be good to go for like speech recognition ? # UI: But we don't have time to market . # ID: And also how much I think # UI: I think we should contact management . # ID: during the kickoff meeting you say that we shouldn't we shouldn't go up to twelve point five Euro per unit so how many units should we sell to have a # PM: Well each unit is sell twenty five Euros . # UI: How muc how much do you get how much do you if you buy one million units h no , one hundred thousand units . # UI: We're gonna need chips right . # UI: How much will it cost for one hundred thousand ? # ID: Usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip . # PM: Because we are # UI: So you have any idea for a powerful one that has good enough for do speech recognition . # PM: It seems that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting . # UI: Four million . # PM: Maybe we can we can look at the new requirement I receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have . # ID: I just had a question do you want to continue with your presenta ? # PM: I will continue . # PM: Well ask your question if you want . # ID: you say that I don't remember by heart but thirty per cent of the tested people say that's it's quite difficult to use the remote control . # ID: Do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason ? # ID: maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that . # ME: Would j w I think they say that it's difficult to learn how to use it but i when you know how to use it , it's okay . # PM: It's not intuitive first . # ID: But maybe and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want ? # ID: You say that I want , I have six button # UI: Mh-hmm . A a lot of people are if you have the L_C_D_ screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them # PM: But , but also it seems that # UI: but it will be hard to configure I mean imagine i so it's really something for the expert user . # UI: I mean there are markets and markets . # UI: I think the young people are th are Christine here said you have a So for our young people it will be cool , they can be able to use it . # UI: Th maybe their parents will not but they will configure it . # UI: I don't know if there is study about that . # PM: Maybe it would be more complex to configure it to be simple than creating a simple product . # UI: And there are another thing is that if we make something that's simple and easy to use that's bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else . # UI: Otherwise , if it's different then of course everybody has somebody has to learn to use it first . # PM: But also we see that most people find it find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons . # PM: So we may just make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons and maybe also some lightning stuff too because most people find also hard to find the remote control . # PM: Losed lose it etcetera . # PM: These these are these two points are the main frustrations so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to find when lost it will add a serious competitive advantage without making something too complex and too long to develop . # PM: So but le let us see first the new requirement . # PM: So we don't have to so this is in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that # UI: But teletext is just one button . # PM: but then you have to you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and stuff . # UI: You you just write the write the numbers . # UI: So will you add with the channel keys , right ? # PM: So anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's not used any more by users , they prefer to s # UI: I'm sure that it don't like but I don't see just one button . # PM: If i one button is still one more button . # PM: if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors . # PM: Well anyway I have this point . # PM: We can discuss . # PM: Also so as I told before it would be better if it's only for the T_V_ because we want to be quick on the market . # PM: And then also we have to make very uh clear that this remote control is part of our products and show our corporate logo and colours on the on the design as well so that they identify it as one of our product . # PM: So this is the key point . # PM: So before finishing we can define what would be the characteristic of the o th of the control of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera . # PM: do you so from the Marketing Expert I think a key aspect is the easy to use aspect , it should be very simple and most button are never used only ten per cent of the button are used often so I think we have to do something very simple and I think we all agree on that point , # UI: Well if it is going to be just a T_V_ remote control it is going to be very simple . # PM: So the key point here is simple . # PM: So few buttons , channel , volume control and what el what function do you see in addition to that ? # UI: Well if it's going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control , there is no other function that I can see really . # PM: Maybe switch T_V_ on and off # UI: no you want to keep television on so that the advertising can revenue can come back to us . # UI: Or something . # PM: Volume , maybe a mute button , and then on off button . # PM: And that's all ? # ID: I know that som you say that many people are doing plenty of a lot of zapping . # ID: I know tha I discovered that when I did a quick look , they do now som they do something which is quite nice now , # ID: you have a button , you press it , and this is the previous channel which has come back . # PM: Maybe we can include that also . Previous previous channel button . # PM: So we have like channel button , the previous channel button , the volume button , plus a mute button , and just the traditional on off button . # UI: And and of course the channel changing buttons . # PM: I talk about that , ? # UI: How should they how should we implement that ? # UI: Because could be numerical only or could be also incremental . # PM: Incremental definitely because zapping you switch them . # ID: Let's say that we can do something like that . # ID: This is incremental , but once you press it for a long time , you go five by five . # ID: To go fa to go faster . # UI: Mm . It's an interesting idea , that if you press it for a long time it does something else , in general . # UI: So if you have your ten buttons for the for the numeric the numerical buttons and you have instead of having just one memory you have if you press them for a long time No . Doesn't work does it . # PM: Maybe we should have also a digit button # UI: Maybe we should have a complete keyboard and just type console commands . # UI: Change channel to eight . # PM: Maybe we have also to have digits or only incremental . # PM: I dunno bec because if you have the # UI: Well if it's useful like if you want to change between three channels for example then you h you cannot you cannot work with just memory being incremental . # PM: Because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one . # PM: So I think we need also digits . # PM: Maybe we can make very obvious the channel and volume button and smaller button down there with the digits . # UI: when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time # ID: Or we can do something like that . # ID: We can design the remote control to have access . # ID: You know some remote control have protection and so you y # UI: Hey I just thought this thing there is a I mean you know there is are some with a wheel like this . # UI: Instead of having the up down buttons for you can have the wheel . # ID: a kind of joystick . # PM: Maybe we can have a wheel for incremental . # PM: So have a wheel for incremental , have the digits on the lower side that can be closed so as you say protected , and I think this is the basi # UI: On the lower side I think it you have to turn it . # PM: And do we do we have a # ID: Or a or a ball , not a wheel but a ball , and you say to # PM: No , a wheel is better . # PM: I would say the wheel is better . # UI: Because of that # PM: What is the expert of # UI: The channels change one by one . # UI: So you have to the user has to like to should feel the discrete sense a bit . # PM: That's a good idea . # PM: Well also we have to decide so it should be lightening in the dark I think because most people lost their remote control . # ID: 'S quite it's quite easy we do that w with back light on the on the wheel . # UI: Even if i L_E_D_ or a if it's the L_C_D_ feature # ID: A blue a blue L_E_D_ and we sell that . # PM: and do we put an L_C_D_ display ? # PM: Because it was important for young customers if you remember . # UI: I think it's only put on if cou have multi function . # UI: If you do not multi function then there is no p point in having L_C_D_ . # UI: Just increase the cost . # UI: The user does not have an advantage really . # PM: And so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process # UI: Well if it's going to delay but it will be cool . # UI: Because a user could say C_N_N_ for example and it would go C_N_N_ . Mm . # PM: That would be cool . # PM: But eight months is really long Maybe we can just # PM: So I will I will so I we will move to next meeting so in after the lunch break here are the individual action you are required to do but you will be recalled to the actions by email I think but you can take notes if you if you want but well the instruction will be sent . # PM: thank you for your suggestion and I will make a summary of that meeting that I will put in the shared folder you can't see and then you will you will be able to see what has been has been said on this meeting and what has been decided . # PM: maybe for next meeting send me your presentation before by email so that we can see them altogether . # PM: That would be easier . # UI: What is the folder that you put yours in ? # UI: And did it did work ? # PM: No it did not work . # PM: She send it to me by email . # ME: I dunno , I dunno it . # PM: So maybe this is better , to send it by email . # UI: what is your email ? # PM: it's in the first email so I'm participant one at AMI # UI: At participant one . Okay . # PM: where is that , it's here . # PM: Participant one at AMI . # PM: So see you after lunch break . # UI: Well during lunch break actually . # ME: 'Kay thank you . # UI: So next time we should have a fight . # UI: How about management or something . # UI: Who happens to be your friend .
# PM: So we are here for the concept design meeting . # PM: So , we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . # PM: I will take notes during this meeting so that you can look at my folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . # PM: So each of you will show us the various investigation they've done during previous hours . # PM: We'll then t take decision in concert and then uh we will define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . # PM: So , last time we decided to have a simple interface . # PM: We also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button . # PM: Channel digit buttons should be protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple . # PM: We have also button for volume , and to switch on off the T_V_ . # PM: We have also the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features . # PM: So now we will have three presentations . # PM: So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer , the specification of the U_I_ by or U_I_ # UI: Abdul al-Hasred is my name . # PM: And the last point is trend watching by Market Expert . # PM: So maybe we can start with industrial design . # PM: So this is the presentation . # PM: Maybe I can switch slide on your request . # ID: I only v have three slides , so . # ID: I just look at the mm just this . On some web pages to find some documentation and I think a remote control is , as I s mentioned previously , you just have a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a wheel control . # ID: So uh I was looking basically for that chip , which is very standard , and I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button . # ID: we can change directly . # ID: In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control . # ID: The push button are usually extremely cheap , but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive . # ID: And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if we could combine something with the push button . # ID: a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a push button . # PM: But is it a significant price on the whole remote control ? # PM: Because we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control . # PM: So will this with including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be lower than twelve Euros to produce ? # ID: But I don't think that we should We should talk about the design of the box also which needs some money . # UI: Also have to say Did you receive the email about the voice recognition ? # PM: You received something # ID: I haven't chec # UI: You we an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed . # UI: It says that ri right now they just use it to record answers to particular questions . # UI: But I guess it could be # PM: And could it be adapted ? # UI: I guess it's possible . # UI: I mean instead of recording the answers you can just record something simpler like a command . # PM: Okay and there can recognize some commands and stuff ? # UI: you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , so if they already have it as a chip then we could use it . # PM: Okay maybe we can just listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news . # ID: but I think it's I haven't written my personal references . # ID: the I just want to mention the problem of the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , and if we could reduce that . # ID: We we have already some good things with um with the backlight of the push button . # UI: I have a question about that actually . # UI: , what is the purpose of the light ? # ID: Just to make something which is slightly more design that a squarey box with a rubber # PM: You can easily find the button in the dark or so ? # UI: But in th in the dark but is going to be always turned on , the light ? # PM: It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think , # UI: But if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it . # UI: You can see the buttons better , of course . # UI: But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement . # ID: As soon as you thought to move the remote control you have the light . # UI: but you need another sensor for that , right ? # UI: no it's too expensive . # ID: I don't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but the bill starts to be # UI: but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , # ID: First of all I was thinking to have a continuous light and you w when t you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device # PM: But it can be battery consuming , no ? # PM: To have the light always on ? # PM: Well we will discuss that after maybe the other presentations . # UI: So my one , it should be in the shared folder . # UI: It was last time I saw it . # UI: just move to the next slide . # UI: So basically want very simple , right ? # UI: That's the major idea , as simple as possible . # UI: So I just look at some current designs on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . # UI: And let's look at two of them because th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . # UI: And in our case we just reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler . # PM: And also does it fit well in hand ? # PM: Because it was th your wrist problem with the usage . # UI: Well this these remotes are quite big , so go to the next page , We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle . # UI: So , from the bottom or whatever is there , the numbers and then the top , until the ten also , this middle part , and on the left one is exactly the same . # UI: So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , These are the basic thing . # PM: So it's only the central part . # UI: So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two . # PM: With a maybe a more ergonomic design on the bottom part . # UI: if you have , for example I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . # UI: It could be on the right side , for example . # UI: Because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have . # UI: And I think that the plastic cover is not very good idea because you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things . # UI: you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way . # PM: Will be down or # UI: So that they're separate a bit , and it's easy to press the other the big buttons , but , it's not that difficult to press the channel buttons either . # UI: , I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user . # UI: Alright , you won't . # UI: Usually what I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with , like buttons for t tuning the channels and stuff like that . # UI: That you want to protect a bit . # UI: And I think it's reasonable . # UI: So , I don't think , this is just the wheel . # UI: We could use the some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want . # UI: so we could just basically use one just wheel and user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case . # PM: Maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors . # PM: Because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple . # PM: So maybe it's worse to have more expense on that's that aspect . # UI: I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that . # PM: So we can move to the Is there any question ? # PM: For designer of user interface ? # PM: or we can move to the next part , maybe , and discuss afterwards ? # ME: So now the recent investigation we have done fo of the remote control . # ME: So , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel . # ME: And the second aspect is that the remote control should be technological innovative . # ME: And the third most important aspect is to is that the co remote control should be easy to use . # ME: So , are things we are we have speak about before . # ME: And so you can go And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends , fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures . # ME: So , maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form something like that , or # ID: I support an apple . # ME: And the mm the material is expected to be spongy . # ME: I don't know which material can be spongy , and if you # PM: This is good also for # UI: Well , wou I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing , it would work , right ? # PM: I think it is good also f to have a spongy material , . # UI: You can throw it to the television . # PM: , because it's robust . # UI: that's a cool one . # UI: We could say that if you throw it , you have a sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off . # UI: When it d takes a shock . # ID: I know that they do that for alarm clock also . # ME: An and this you can you can say that . # ME: You ca you can go before # ME: , before , yes . And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel , after is technological innovative , and after the easy to use . # PM: I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has . # ME: that's why that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible . # PM: I think it's it makes it both easy and both innos innovative . # ME: Innovative . Mm . # PM: So I think it's a good aspect and it should be kept . # UI: How do we make it look cool is the question . # PM: We have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable . # PM: Maybe a colour that remember some fruit , things like that . # UI: Well the obvious thing is a banana , I guess . # ME: I thought about a pear , for example . # ME: You know the pear , is like that and it's easy to have in hand # PM: and it's ergonomic as well . # UI: The banana is also ergonomic . # PM: Maybe pear or something like that . # ME: Or a fruit like that . # PM: We can discuss that . # PM: D Is is there anything you want to add ? # UI: Is there any fruit that is spongy ? # PM: I don't think so . # PM: I think we can have like a pear is good , fit well , or banana as you told . # PM: Something like that . # ID: And for maybe look and feel , what about a piece of ice , with blue L_E_D_ inside ? # PM: But that's not in the trend . # UI: You can make it # PM: The trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits . # UI: It's not hard , the metal . # PM: I think p spongy is good because it will be robust as well . # PM: I think we can keep the wheel because it's easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher , and we also have to find a , so , a fruit like pear or banana wit any others idea you have . # PM: What kind of fr fruit would you like to control your T_V_ with ? # ID: Banana I think , it's a nice idea . # PM: Banana is also yellow so you can't lost your remote control then . # ID: Because You y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that , # UI: Two of the button , # ID: but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , and here you have a push button to # ME: But you don't have # PM: I think it's a good idea , . # UI: so you can just have just have this curve , and you move your hand here to press the buttons and then you move on the other side . # UI: So you can have it on two sides and it'll be cool , # PM: I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then . # PM: Maybe we can keep the banana . # PM: And it will be very easy to find . # ID: And everybody knows what is a banana . # UI: You can put also vibrator inside . # ID: If you if you start with fancy fruits and fra s and tha # UI: You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company . # PM: it's really a good point . # UI: I hope the students of management die , but anyway . # UI: Now who are recording this meeting ? # PM: I think it One second . # PM: So we have to take some decision on this aspect . # PM: So , so for component , we have to think about those aspects , # ID: So we will just use a standard battery ? # ID: And the chip we chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use . # ID: what do you mean by case ? # PM: I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape . # ID: I mean for me if we use a spongy banana case , doesn't matter . # ID: I just want to have so something to prin to fix my components onto that box , and that's it . # UI: The only th Y that can be in inside th in the structure . # UI: But the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be # UI: I mean if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to I mean if it's spongy then it's going to move , So , it's going to be bend a lot . # ID: Oh no I think it's possible . # UI: So if we try to push the buttons , it # PM: No the button would be # UI: You think it's possible ? # PM: In fact it should be something odd shaped , with a spongy cover . # ID: . This is like the # PM: odd shape with spongy cover . # PM: And standard battery okay , a chip imprint , there's no specific problem . # PM: So we agree to put the wheel # ID: Wheel on the top . # ID: Button , where do we want some buttons ? # UI: usually hold 'Kay , we want it to be good also for the left-hand users , # PM: So it have to it has to be symmetrical . # UI: Sa let's say that th o It has to be basically you can only take two sides , one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is also the thumb . # UI: Or you could use this one , but I don't know if it's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel . # PM: maybe the thumb is more comfortable . # UI: This for the wheel and then this for the buttons ? # PM: I think it's okay for both right and left . Mm . # UI: Should have the two sides . # UI: So if the left , we have # PM: I think you can turn it this way also . # PM: You can do both with both hands . # UI: Wheel buttons . # PM: I think it's okay . # UI: , the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side . # UI: So you cannot see them . # PM: Well , you will get used to it . # PM: And moreover , th the button ar are lighted so you immediately identify the right side , because you have light on buttons . # UI: So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be but if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side . # PM: you I think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty . # PM: I think for lefty it's okay . # PM: I can do this movement , and for righty as well . # PM: I think this doesn't change that much . # PM: for interface we said also that we have this banana shape with button on the s on the side . # PM: and a wheel on the top . # PM: So the colour is yellow . # PM: I think it's we defined everything according to what we should what the decision we should take , . # PM: So maybe we can we can work on those aspects until next meeting . # PM: So have the final look and feel design according to the decision . # PM: And have the user interface design and then evaluate the prodyuc the product . # PM: That is to say , check if it fit the requirement given by the users , but according to your presentation it seems to be okay . # PM: It seems to be fancy , innovative , and easy to use . # PM: to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer work together . # PM: That would be better , I think . # PM: you will receive further instruction by emails , as usual . # PM: do you need to add anything ? # PM: You feel okay ? # PM: You feel free to express what you want to say ? # PM: You don't feel too constrained ? # PM: You don't feel free to answer this ? # UI: Maybe you can make
# PM: Je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype . # PM: It really looks like a banana . # UI: It is a banana . # PM: It is a banana . # UI: It is the essence of bananas . # UI: I would be confused with this thing . # UI: How is everyone ? # PM: So we are here for the detailed design meeting . # PM: we will I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . # PM: Then I've I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you a summary then as usual . # PM: We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by our two colleagues that make good work . # PM: And then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . # PM: Then we will evaluate the product . # PM: And end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . # PM: let's start with the cost aspect I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say to have a standard battery , to have a yellow banana shaped case with a rubber material around it to feel spongy , # UI: Like a banana . # PM: and also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera . # PM: And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros . # PM: which is good , because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros . # PM: for the financial aspect it's okay , we can we can continue with this product as if , and we are now going to see the project evaluation with our marketing expert . # ME: you can have my project in # PM: You have a presentation ? # PM: Participant four , yes . # ME: We can go through . # ME: I made an evaluation and the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about during the previous meetings . # ME: So you can go through okay so we have six points . # ME: we talked about before . # ME: we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , easy to find in a room , and robust , I have a scale of seven points . # ME: Okay . So I go through all the all the points here , and according to what you think about the this project you can mm make a one point , two point or seven point . # ME: And after we ha we have an average , and we see . # ME: fancy look and feel , what do you think ? # PM: Maybe you can presen # ME: between o one and seven . # PM: Maybe hold it . # PM: So I think it's very nice . # PM: What do you think ? # UI: I give it a I give it a five . # PM: it's between one and seven ? # PM: Seven is the highest ? # PM: I will give a six . # ID: I will give a five . # UI: Do you vote Christine ? # UI: Do you also vote ? # ME: I just want to see something # PM: Maybe we all have to agree on a common # UI: we can very easily . # ME: I think and need to as well . # ME: I don't know if you we ha we have to put one f If it's better or # PM: we can choose what we want . # PM: let's say that seven is the best . # ME: Or maybe we can say s seven is the best mm . # PM: do note the grade we have five , six for me , And what what's your choice ? # PM: How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ? # ME: s you can how much what ? # PM: How much would you don't answer to this questionnaire ? # ME: I mm I dunno mm , I think six , it's a good # UI: So it will have five point five average . # PM: Five point five average . # ME: Okay . So after , the technological aspect ? # PM: Okay , techne technological aspect . # ME: we said we have a new technological thing with a wheel . # PM: , we have the wheel . # PM: We also have the rubber material , which make it like new also . # PM: I think I would give a five . # ID: A four also , because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation . # ID: The rubber is a four . I # UI: are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not ? Huh ? # PM: what's your grade ? # PM: So we have four , four f and five ? # ME: We can put four ? # PM: , four . Four , let's put four . # UI: For twenty five . # ME: Everyone is okay or four poin # ME: Very easy to use . Do you think it's easy to use ? # UI: I give a seven , I think . # PM: I would give a I would give a seven as well . # PM: It's very easy to use . # ME: Mm , six for me also . # ME: Six point five . # PM: six point five . # ID: Six six point five . # ME: Is it fashion ? # PM: its f its fruit shape . # PM: I would say seven . # PM: And is very nice design . # ME: it's fashion , because it's a fruit , # UI: we can we can put a seven here . # ME: and we say that the # ME: easy to find in a room ? # ID: I lost my banana . # PM: I think you can't miss it . # UI: I think it's cool . # UI: I think we can put a six here . # ME: We have the lightning , # ME: The lighting . # PM: we don't sesh especially have the lightning # UI: So you'll make the material transparent so that it lights up completely , # PM: I think it's very easy to I would say seven . # PM: It's hard to miss it . # ME: Is it is it robust ? # PM: it's rubber , made of rubber , # ID: it's ru it's rubber . # PM: I think it's m it's more rubber than other remote control . # UI: the only problem there might be which know , i if it's very sensitive , they will , I don't know # PM: But it is it is surrounded by rubber material . # PM: So maybe we can put a six . # ME: Everybody is okay , six . # ID: Six or five . Five # PM: We have to sum up everything . # ME: Thirteen , twenty , twenty six point five , seven , thirty two , thirty six . # ME: That's that's okay ? # ME: if we say that seven it's the better , # ME: and when s six sit six are good it's a good p product , I think . # PM: Okay , so six is a # UI: So will become eight soon ? # PM: So it's a good evaluation , I think . # PM: It's very promising . # UI: it's a bit biased . # ME: We have a good price # PM: So this prototype is quite nice . # UI: Because I saw some phones that were banana shaped , wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house , quite big also , and they were selling something like a hundred Euros , two hundred Euros . # UI: Just a just a phone , wireless . # PM: So having this at twenty five Euros is quite attractive , I think . # ID: But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare . # UI: it's much more complex , # PM: I think , we can summarise . # PM: we have seen the prototype . # PM: It's very nice according to the work of our two designer . # PM: The the financial aspect were okay . # PM: We we have the cost below our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit . # PM: The the evaluation give satisfying result as well . # PM: So I think we can move to the last part of the meeting . # PM: the cost is in the budget , the evaluation is okay , so I th I think we can now open champagne and make a huge party . # ID: Start to eat banana . # PM: I don't know if it's provided by the meeting staff . # PM: Okay so congratulation . # PM: Nice product . # UI: Congratulations to the team . # UI: very well , we worked together fantastically . # PM: I think it was a good collaboration . # UI: what does the management say ? # UI: What does the management say ? # PM: I think we will have much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well . # PM: All it depends on who watch this meeting . # PM: Okay , so good guys , so see you for next successful project .
# PM: we are here to talk about functional design . # PM: Now hopefully we've all got a better idea from than we did f leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . # PM: So here's an agenda . # PM: you should know that I'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as I was struggling to our last time and that'll be easier for me now because I'm not actually giving the whole presentation . # PM: the additional points are just the stuff that we sent and that I forwarded on from upper management having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful . # PM: now you can all give your presentations . # PM: We can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions . # PM: Right , forty minutes for this meeting , so a bit more time than the last one . # PM: Here's the additional points I just wanted to put those in there to see if you guys had any comments on them . # PM: did you all receive that email ? # PM: So does anyone have any overall # ME: Well what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be having no teletext , people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we're not we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now . # ME: So that's , from a marketing perspective I see I see a lack . # ME: And so we have to go , I think , in the other direction . # ME: What are we gonna have that makes this thing better than # PM: Well tha that first point could also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated , some sort remote control that can work with the Internet there is the opportunity that's presented , I guess . # ME: Right . No , I agree with you . # ME: So what I'm talking about is I see that one side we're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side which is , what are we gonna be targeting our market that identifies our product as better than because it doesn't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta . # ME: So that's that was my reactions . # PM: but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television . # PM: So we're quite fixed . # PM: So we're really probably , in terms of marketing , are looking for that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product . # ID: bu but we we're designing only the remote , we not design the T_V_ . # ID: So we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any T_V_ that we people use our remote with . # ID: So it's kind of a stupid decision . # ME: I think we take with you . # PM: But there's also the potential for mark there's a market here for our lost teletext . # PM: For example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement wants it as cheap as possible . # PM: Twenty-five Euros is the selling price , we really have to innovate here I guess . # ME: That's what I'm that's what I'm talking about is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product 'cause somebody , some people are gonna be hap unhappy 'cause it took they can't ac access their teletext . # ME: 'Cause we're talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are teletext . # ME: So so it's not that I'm criticizing the product at all . # ME: It's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ? # ME: What are we bringing in to take the place of this , and we have to d in my opinion we have to double up . # ME: If we lose one we need to bring two or three . # PM: I think that the last point is probably quite straightforward . # PM: Obviously the w it has to be branded . # ID: So then the double R_ will be our # PM: On the product . # PM: Can you handle that black and yellow ? # UI: I think one of # ID: I tho I tho I thou I think Rol Ro Rolls-Royce might mind , but don't worry . # UI: I think w , one of the things that we should also keep in mind when we're doing this I mean our company's slogan is we put the fashion in electronics , right . # UI: So I think our kind of our target here is to have some kind of very like sleek nice look remote and we want it to be functional as well , but I think one of the main selling points is that we don't want it to be clunky like this thing here . # UI: You know we don't wanna a big clunker . # UI: We want something that looks nice and it's fashionable and so # ME: So you have this ? # PM: So we have three presentations , and I think we'll go in order of participant number here . # PM: So we can have a look at the working design first from participant two . # PM: Mm it's enough . But click it on off ? # UI: so you all know me , I'm the Industrial Designer . # UI: And we've some basic components that our remote is gonna need , just basically every remote'll need 'em . # UI: We need some kinda of power d power source . # UI: we have to decide on our user interface , which is his department , but the in user interface is also a major component . # UI: we need a programmable digital signal processor to take the input from the user and translate that into electronic signal , which we pass to the infra-red L_E_D_ , which you aim at the television which and it receives that signal . # UI: You need a on-off switch I don't know how that got in there . # UI: And we also need to have the if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of T_V_s . # UI: So we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so that'll require some memory as well . # UI: so here's just a basic layout of how the remote would work . # UI: You ha the v the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there , and you can see that we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing , and then passes that signal on to the infra-red L_E_D_ and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor . # UI: So those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything else is pretty much open to move around . # ME: Now is would this be considered just a standard # UI: I think any des # ME: This is not this is not cutting edge technology we're talking here . # ME: We're talking about existing technology . # ME: Nothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries . # UI: this is just this is just a basic layout of ev of all the components that w are gonna be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote . # UI: We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition , I mean that I mean that you can kinda say would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip . # PM: Do we have an idea of costs of different components ? # UI: well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip and the th it could als basically the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as well . # UI: the L_E_D_ and the transistors and everything else are you know they're pretty cheap . # UI: So depending on what we want our functionality to be , the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap . # UI: depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h you know how much power . # PM: Do we have any ballpark figures for that yet ? No . # UI: I don't have any figures right now . # UI: We we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that . # UI: but and I think a significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and you know the b the buttons and things like that , I think . # UI: That's all I have really . # PM: And we have participant three , which I believe is Pedro . # PM: I can give you that to click on . # PM: And you wanna get # ID: When we're fighting over it's also more lot more fun . # PM: View a slide show , that's what you wanna do , ? # PM: Just go up to view . # ID: This doesn't work . # ID: So function design . # ID: you guys know me , Pedro , and what I found is we want to do fashion and I think , honestly , we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design . # ID: basically a case will cost the same if it looks good or bad so we ma we have to make it look good . # ID: something cute and small . # ID: The big chunky remotes are died in the eighties . # ID: So we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at . # ID: And although mo most people will buy s televisions and everything for that have loads of loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people won't get too mad of actually having to go the to the s to the television to , for instance , tune in their the stations . # ID: There's no need to have that in the remote . # ID: as for what I would recommend for the interface design , and I will change the colours on the on the logo , but we should go for the user-oriented device , so simple controls and good ergonomics . # ID: and although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that , I guess , but we should go for the # PM: But I t I think what the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it . # PM: So I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include , it really should be in there . # PM: Because otherwise we're just going to I mean even if it's necessary or not , if you if you're given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without when it really if it i if it isn't more expensive for us to k make because as far as I understand it , it can be operated with the same set of buttons , ? # PM: So it should be in there . # UI: Right as far as i it's just the cost of an extra button . # UI: I mean software-wise there's really no difference . # ME: I have maybe a silly question . # ME: I in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be the it's gonna be out-moded teletext . # ME: I don't understand how those two things are connected . # ME: How does how does computers and teletext h how why is one eliminating the need of the other ? # ME: I don't understand that . # PM: Well maybe what we're getting into here is the idea of Internet through the T_V_ for example . # PM: So that might play on what we can do . # ID: the they're basically aiming at saying that you would use you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for uh the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that # UI: to find out what you're watching even if there's commercials you know . # ID: and now and now you can c look it over Internet . # ID: But I still think teletext is way more convenient until we have the same commodities . # UI: I think I ha I agree . # ME: I just I don't see the cross-over between computers and television . # ME: I mean I do see the cross-over in some sense , # ID: , but it's not happen yet . # ME: but with the remote is used for television , okay . # PM: Well you have digital T_V_ still already . # ME: So so if we make the cross-over and we're gonna view television on computers then we're then we're losing the necessity of the remote . S # UI: Unless you have a # PM: Well there is a for example on digital T_V_ systems you have you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts , and you can you can view through a catalogue for example . # PM: A a family member of mine has got a system where you just you can , and there's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live T_V_ and things like that . # PM: They're just features from the Internet from computers are coming into the T_V_ sort of under the covers , but you still use it through a teletext . # PM: So now the things to think here are that there's gonna be more functionality , potentially that we can handle . # ID: but we don't we're not aiming a command for that . # ID: That's the thing . # ID: And all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and # UI: I think a lot of that's proprietary anyways . # UI: You're not gonna be able to , you , like command a TiVo with our remote . I don't think . # PM: But still there there's an opportunity . # PM: If if it's , for example , a trainable one then we're just simply having like an up , down , left , right , an okay button or something like that might do as well in future proofing it . # ID: but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one , so Well I dunno . # ID: One way the other teletext was there but I guess we can remove it or , you know , make two separate interface designs . # UI: I think if it's possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that . # UI: Just you know # ME: I don't I don't see the logic . # ME: don't see the logic in elimination of teletext , I just I # PM: , and neither do I in fact . # ME: but I'm not a tech-mind either . # ME: I just don't see the cross-over between computers and 'Cause we are designing something for a television , okay . # PM: I'll communicate that back to those guys there a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated w there's no l logic in not having it in there anyway i if it doesn't affect the price . # UI: Right it's just not # PM: but I think what they're pushing us towards here is in terms of thinking of ways to future-proof our system for future systems that have something else other than teletext maybe . # ME: We are selling it to an existing market . # ID: but we're not putting some there's no putting anything in the place of teletext . # ID: That's the problem . # ME: and , and we're also marketing a product . It's what I'm seeing is a is a mid-range cost product . # ME: So so w we can't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing because all of a sudden we are gonna have cost overruns . # ME: So if we drop if we are gonna choose to drop teletext , again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable ? # PM: So if we're keeping it basic we're loo what we're looking to sell it basically is it's just being very easy to use , looking exceptionally good , that sort of thing . # PM: 'Cause we really don't have anything else there , do we ? # ME: I don't I don't see it , and to me if I'm gonna market a product for b for beauty for design I'm gonna I'm gonna try to market it at a much higher price . # ME: I need to make it special with a high price tag . # ME: I don't want to make it economically g competitive . # ME: I want I want to market it as exclusive . # ME: So I would market this product it at eighty-nine Euros and come up with some really beautiful exterior design or something th but I don't think we have that flexibility . # PM: But i if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic , then twenty-five Euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden stan standard T_V_ so the place remote the then the place we're going to justify that cost is through design through making it a sleek elegant high-priced basic remote . # PM: Does that make sense , huh ? # ME: No I no I understand what you say , but what I'm what I'm , okay we probably need to move along , # PM: we probably should . # ME: but my concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product , # PM: We we're doing alright for time . # ME: and if I'm coming in with a with twenty-five Euros , which is mid-market price , then what am I going to give these people for this ? # ME: So that's just my question , but we can keep talking . # PM: Sorry that kinda cut into you there . # ID: just I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands . # ID: as for , you know , the case design maybe I'll come up with more concrete ideas . # ID: Right now it's just the idea of simplicity and slickness , cute and small # UI: I'm just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there , how many people how many people actually use every feature that ar you know i like these trainable remotes and things like that , where , you know , it's just so confusing to do to use all these functions . # UI: Where I think the largest portion of the market is just gonna you know they lost their T_V_ remote , they need another one that'll work with their T_V_ . # UI: They want something that looks nice , that isn't gonna break when they drop it , that you know that maybe it's ergonomic , it feels good in your hand , something like that . # UI: I think that's gonna be where you're gonna find the biggest , you know , market share . # PM: So we are looking for something that looks good and just works , rather than looking for any special features . # UI: I think the more bells and whistles we add , it's just gonna cut into our into our profits . # UI: Because I think as we as we add costs for things like for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that , I think you know what percentage of the of the of the market is actually gonna use that ? # UI: Maybe five percent , you know , # PM: But we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing presentation about this . # PM: Be a good idea . # PM: sorry , I didn't mean to cut in . # PM: I'm not the boss . # ME: Oh P Pedro , I just want to say quickly I would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles , eh . # ME: You know sell things come to my mind is uh something that's voice-activated . # ME: I know we're getting into some , I hope , some big money on this thing , but # PM: I think that's probably a question more for this guy here , . # ME: Is that for over here ? # UI: Well it's kinda both of us . # ME: Okay , alright . # UI: Us us user interface . # ME: 'Cause and I think of voice-activated I think of how many times I've lost my remote and I can't find it . # ME: So some way that I can I can find my remote by clapping my hands or something # UI: I was thinking about that . # UI: Then your lights would go off , though . # ME: and so But this 's just something . # ME: I'm trying to find some bells and whistles 'cause when they talk about tel taking out teletext , it's like , what are we gonna put in ? # ME: What makes this thing attractive ? # ME: And it's only for televisions . # ME: So we everyth our competition out there has got these multiple adaptors where they can use 'em for their V_C_R_s , their D_V_D_s , their televisions and we're coming out with one remote for television only . # ME: And so to me we have to make this a really special product I don't s I really have to say I don't see the market niche for this product . # ME: At this price I don't see it yet . # ME: I'm I go along with this , because this is what we're given to try to market , but I don't see the market niche for this product without some really sort of something really special to identify it as unique in the market . # ID: But we th that should be design . # ID: That should be the design basically . # ID: I think technology we'd we we're not in the price range to do it . # ID: We don't have the money to do it towards t f technology so we should we should aim at design . # ME: Have to do you have to do it in the box ? # ME: Okay well , so that's up to you then to make this box in something that's absolutely extraordinary . # ME: Maybe make it in the form of a gun . # ME: We can sell it in United States . # PM: I have a question for you . # PM: Does any of the features that Pedro's spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure functionality ? # PM: In terms of making it work or the cost of that or # UI: I think all these things are pretty standard . # UI: I think we'll be okay . # PM: Onto participant four . # ME: Well you know for marketing f marketing for me is and how do I go here ? # UI: Mm you can just click . # ME: Is that right ? # UI: you just get off that . # UI: You just click anywhere . # ME: , what for me is it I d I don't know what I'm marketing right now , okay , 'til you spoke and when I wrote this , I don't know what I'm marketing . # ME: I just know that I was identified as a we identified ourselves as a as a developer , as a manufacturer , and as a as a distributor t to other wholesalers . # ME: And so the th the twenty-five Euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price . # ME: That's what we decided here . # ME: so what I did is I decided that this needs to be a product in a in a sense can market itself . # ME: So what we've identified here as our main marketing stratagem is in design . # ME: We're making the most beautiful attractive whatever we decide it is . # ME: So that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left . # ME: so I would like to have a product that we can sell easily . # ME: So I say inspiration , so having something beauty , something attractive , something that in a sense will sell itself . # ME: innovation I think fits into what we're talking about here with design . # ME: cutting edge technology , I don't think we're gonna have that , these were ideas I was putting together , unless we come up with some New Age product a as far as the casing is concerned . # ME: I wanna make this thing something that I can identify as special in some way , so maybe we can have some I talked about environmentally sensitive , maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home . # ME: These are just thoughts . # ME: I wanted to talk about who we are as a as a corporation , that we're new , we're aggressive , we're competitive , we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line . # ME: So to me it's about selling d our identity our corporate identity along with the product . # ME: what I found is that the projected costs are competitive . # ME: we're kind of in the middle of the market , but what I'm seeing is that the market is ready for I identified new technology , but again , because what I see is budget restrictions and limitations , I don't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing . # ME: If if we could have a technological something # UI: I have an idea . # UI: And it's kind of along the s lines of environmentally sensitive , and it may even fit into ergonomics , and even kind of address the issue of losing the remote , what we were saying it's a common issue . # UI: what we can do is , well you know that batteries throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy . Right ? # UI: And s for some people Well maybe not a solar remote but instead what about if we had like a power cradle ? # UI: Like a cradle that is there to hold the remote when you're not using it , so you'll always know where the remote is 'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote , and we can , instead of having instead of having , you know , replaceable batteries we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote . # UI: You never have to get go through the go through all these different batteries . # UI: And also you can I think it's a good opportunity for the user design or for not just for the user design , but also for the just for the look and feel of the remote as a whole . # UI: You know you could have some kind of neat little , you know , a sexy design for d a cradle and the remote itself . # ME: Blah , I like it . # ME: I like the idea , but we're talking about in cost is gonna probably double . # UI: It w it would increase the cost . # ME: But boy , we can sell this thing , because there's no batteries , it's environmentally sensitive , i we can identify it as a safer product in some form . # UI: And you could page the remote if you lose it . # UI: Maybe there's a button on the cradle . # ME: Yep , that's right . # PM: Now the question is can we make this for less than twelve-fifty per ? # ME: But the cost i No no . No no , we have t we have to change the end cost . # PM: We we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because Can we dl can we do that without changing it twelve-fifty per product , if we basically can sell more based on this ? # ME: There's I mean I don't see it anyway . # ME: that's gonna be up to these guys . # ME: I my reaction is no , but # UI: what I can do is I can d look into ho well Pedro and I can look into how much this might increase our costs and you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is gonna have on our on our final numbers . # PM: we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that's gonna be # ME: Well , see I see I I'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product . # ME: You know , let's sell this wholesale for fifty Euros , sixty Euros . # ME: Let's make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , high-tech design , ergonomics , all of this . # ME: Just make this thing , the Rolls Royce of remote controls . # ME: Every home's got to have it . # ME: If you don't have one , hey what kind of remote do you have ? # ME: Oh you've got one of those , oh fantastic , I want one of those too . # ME: I just don't have enough money right now . # UI: I just don't know about that , because in order to do that in order to price it at that kind of level I think we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being able to operate , you know , the D_V_D_ player and , you know , the stereo system and all that . # UI: Which is a pretty basic function that w we've opted out of . # UI: And additionally we're m maybe not supporting teletext # PM: I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext . # UI: But I do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have . # ME: one thing I don't understand is h they've given us this package , okay . # ME: Now in my opinion we need to give them a package back , okay . # ME: They say they say okay here you go . # ME: They gave us a fundament a foundation of what they want , and w it's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate . # ME: I don't think it's our place to create their product for them , maybe it is . # ME: I don't know what kind of role we have in this in the corporate ladder , but to me it's like , okay , you have got your here's our ideas , okay . # ME: And then let them look at those ideas and they say , well , we can we can raise the price twenty percent , you know we like this idea , this idea no , but to me it's about a choice , do we follow their directives or do we make presentations back and then and then discuss ? # ME: beca I do not I do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing f handing us right now . # UI: I have to disagree though . # UI: I think our market niche is basically people who need who have lost their remote or who've broken their remote and don't wanna send back to the manufacturer , they just wanna run out to the store and get a remote , and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote . # UI: It does what they need . # UI: These aren't I think that it # PM: And and th to get to back to another point , sorry uh for cutting in but , I th I think it's important to remember that this remote has to work with multiple T_V_s , 'cause it's selling on its own . # PM: It's not going to be specifically for Hitachi T_V_s or whatever . # ME: No I understand that . # PM: So technologically , if I understand it , T_V_s T_V_ remote's working exactly the same way as video remotes and D_V_D_ remotes . # PM: All you need to do is train them to the individual one , all you need to do is know the f like some four-digit code . # PM: So saying that it works with all T_V_s is equivalent to saying that it'll work with D_V_D_s and other things . # ME: they've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions . # ID: y you wouldn't # ME: They've identified this product limita # PM: We have done this . # ME: That's why I say I don't I don't see the market niche for this . # ID: The interface will be different . # ME: If we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for D_V_D_s , V_C_R_s and everything , then I can see the market niche , but we we're only identified as going for televisions without teletext . # ME: And it's like whoa we ha in my opinion we have to go with something that's extremely exclusive to make this thing marketable , # ME: because who wants just a television remote ? # UI: We he well here's my thing about that . # UI: If you're in the market for this ultimate remote , you're not gonna go for just a television remote . # UI: If it can't control if it can't control your D_V_D_ player and a al if y if you can't get that all-in-one ultimate remote , that just you can throw all your other remotes away . I'm not gonna buy a d seventy-five Euro remote . # ME: I have a tendency to agree with you . # PM: So we really can't chase that . # ME: That's why I say I quest I q I question the marketability of the product . # ME: I really question where we create the demand . # UI: So I think what we # PM: We're really looking for something basic . # UI: So that's what I'm saying # PM: The the one thing that you said really struck a chord with me here in that we're carrying the corporate identity with the product , but we're actually looking for a large profit at the same time where I'd be inclined to go back to upper-level management and say like let's just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here . # PM: We're selling more than just the product . # PM: We're trying to get mind-share about Real Reaction to the people who are gonna buy consumer electronics . # PM: We want people to eventually say , oh that's Real Reaction that's a good m make . It's reliable . # PM: And and we're gonna make it we're gonna win mind-share by either being a fantastic product or for it working , it just being good , reasonable-priced , and solid . # PM: So if we can make if we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking I think that's in itself an extremely big thing . # UI: I think that's big . # ME: W okay if you if you drop the cost , now if you make if you make go to the other side of the cost scale , and you make it less expensive , then all of a sudden now we're going into an a new market area . # ME: So we can say low-cost uh good design , beautiful , wa-da-da-da-da-da . # PM: We only have a few minutes left . # ME: But what I'm saying is right now we're middle market . # PM: Is twenty-five Euros a mid-market price for a remote ? # ME: for multi for a multi-function remote , that's a mid-market price . # ME: In a discount right now you can buy 'em on sale sometimes for about eighteen , nineteen Euro , and that's for the multi-functions , D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , catch-alls . # ME: And and they have 'em in a little box in the middle , and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls . # ME: So to me , to market this a t only a television remote control we have to change consciousness . # ME: We have to have something that will change people's thinking to identify this as advantageous , and I don't know what that is . # ME: It's gotta be low-cost or high-cost with special design features . # PM: Well I'd be inclined to say , if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost , then that's the way we really should play it . # PM: If we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twenty-five and make a low profit-margin on it , but we're really doing that to sell the brand . # PM: Yep we have five minutes left . # PM: rather th to sell for Real Reactions . # PM: And I can communicate this to the more senior mm people within the company here to get a reaction . # UI: What about the idea that I had with the cradle ? # UI: How do you feel about that ? # PM: Well how does everybody feel ? # UI: Or how does everybody feel ? # ME: I mean I well we g we're talking about the other end now . # UI: but I that's the thing I don't think it's necessarily the other end . # ME: I like the idea , but we have t we have to find out # PM: The other the o the problem with that in my mind I just think off-hand as a as a consumer , would I wanna buy that ? # PM: And I think maybe not because I've got a remote and I'll take it to different chairs , I'll take it to different I w I don't wanna go over somewhere and put it down . # PM: It i if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair , and that implies that there's only one T_V_ user . # PM: So it's very good for some people but it's not a like # UI: Well it lasts it would last for several hours on its own power , but when you're done with it you put it back in the cradle . # PM: But it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent . # PM: You have to l sort of remember . # PM: You have to d shift down the side of the couch to find it and put it back and I d I d I d I think it in my mind it doesn't seem like something that oh I'd really want because of that fact . # PM: But I don't know , that's just my opinion . # ME: Well , I think again it's it we have a cost issue here . # ME: You know if we're gonna go in this direction , to me we're going to the other side of the cost range . # ME: Are we gonna make this selling the cost as a high high-tech environmentally sensitive whatever , or are we gonna go to the lower side of the range ? # ME: Again I don't see our market niche in the middle for our product yet . # ME: I don't see it yet . # PM: So what do we think maybe we should Pedro , do you have any opinion on it ? # ID: we should keep it simple , mm medium-low cost mar cost area and make it look good . # ME: W a question I have in a 'cause I think I agree with you on , we gotta make it a box . # ME: The box is gonna sell it I think , the outside , the casing . # PM: Really need to wrap up now . # ME: Can can we have multiple designs ? # ME: Have a modern , have a traditional , have a you know , and so instead of them all looking the same , people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from . # ME: I don't know what that creates cost , or # UI: Well the problem with that is we may end up with a whole bunch of inventory of a of a poor design you know . So # ME: Yep one over another . # ME: , okay , I hear that . # ID: , complicated but # UI: but what we could do is some kind of well I mean we need to , I mean , have a few designs to look at and then come up with something that I think we all agree is , you know , the best fit . # UI: I think w what's really important is it has to look good , it has to feel it has to feel good in your hand , it has to be durable , it has to a and I think it's really important that it doesn't look cheap . # UI: I think I think we have to make sure people look at it an and feel like it its like a quality remote . Even though the cost may be low . # ME: What ab what ab what about a remote that's that doesn't maybe look like a remote ? # ME: Just just okay 'cause I mean we all know what a remote looks like on the outside . # ME: They're selling these things everywhere . # ME: Maybe that could be part of our design exclusivity , is we make a remote that doesn't even look like a remote it opens like a telephone . # UI: Or what if it looks like a pen ? # ME: Doesn't matter , . # ME: I'm just jus I talking about some something to make this thing unique . # ME: That's the thing , I'm gonna keep thumping on . # ME: I'll sell whatever you guys design . # ME: I don't have a problem selling a product , that's not the issue . # ME: I give you ideas , you guys create the product . # ME: Once you have the finished product I'll find a way to sell it . # ME: Don't worry about it . # ME: I just give you these things now , because these are my thoughts and feelings . # UI: just to touch on m my point one last time that I had brought up . # UI: I really un unless you guys are die-hard against the fact that it's possible like it reduces the usability of the remote b and the fact that you can't lose it on your own , I think it still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle . # UI: Because I really think i in a certain sense it almost like for me I would want to have that just , because I know at the end of when I'm done watching T_V_ that when I'm done , oh I better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs . # UI: Maybe th that's just some people that like that . # PM: I mean there's al there's also remote controls I remember that worked , this hasn't been done in a while I think , but th as a as a watch . # UI: A lot of people As a watch ? # PM: there is remote control watches , but I think they're a sorta eighties thing , so it might not be easy to market in it but the technologies came along and it might be cheaper to make now . # ID: they are not simple . # PM: Those things may have been inexpensive for all I know . # ME: One thing I just thought about when you were saying that , is that the p our target market is gonna be someone who has lost or broken # UI: That's what I was saying . # ME: We gotta stop ? # ME: Who's lost or broken their remote . # ME: So how many remotes do they wanna buy ? # ME: Can we p can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one ? # ME: And so with this kind of system or locator or something , to think about , how have people been losing or breaking their remote ? # ME: How does this happen ? # PM: The last remote you'll ever buy . # UI: And also presumably they've # ME: And and then and then design the product , maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy . # PM: Well if we're going down that then we can we don't need to go the # PM: it strikes me that the locator feature might actually be quite expensive to make . # PM: Whereas actually just putting it in a power cradle might not be too expensive at all because that's just done with mobile phones you can just n we have said we have actually similar products that we can take from and potentially cut costs there . # UI: The locator'll definitely be more expensive . # PM: need to look into whether we can do that but I think we have some m mobile phone-based products checking quickly our Internet . # PM: We really need to finish up here . But # ME: we can make it in the shape of a coffee pot . # PM: we have the power-adaptor products . # PM: We sell power-adaptor products . # PM: So for example there's nothing stopping us using that technology . # ME: It's just it's that I think it's telling us to stop our meeting . # ME: So we have the c we probably have on-line in our in our system , we have the ability to create this , we're talking about . # ME: A charging system . # PM: without it being too In fact we can cut costs through using the manufacturing that's already gonna be in place here . # ME: If if we can create this we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics . # UI: I think one of the things that we can put right on the box is , never buy another battery . # UI: You know , something like that . # PM: 'Kay . Thanks guys . # ME: No that's not what I want , I want Oh look it here .
# PM: Afternoon guys . # ME: Rock and roll . # ME: So do we need to re-train Mike on how to put his mic on ? # ME: Okay , can he get it all by himself this time ? # PM: I dunno , I'm feeling like a big boy . # ID: Probably not , 'cause he's 'S been listening to too much . # ID: He's getting retarded . Yay . # ME: I believe I can fly . # UI: Alright well we got some exciting stuff for you guys . # ME: Just what I needed was something exciting . # ME: Remember , I'm an old man . # PM: 'Kay , ready to go ? # PM: 'Kay so we've got our conceptual design meeting . # ID: Apparently I'm old as well . # PM: Hopefully we've all got exciting ideas now . # ME: Thirty's really young , eh ? # PM: k exciting ideas . # PM: 'Kay so here's our agenda our agenda . # PM: I'm gonna open . # PM: I'm gonna talk for a bit about what we're gonna do . # PM: I'm gonna take some notes . # PM: We're gonna all do a presentation , and then hopefully we're gonna make some decisions now . # PM: Well when I say hopefully , we have to . So # PM: I'm gonna let you guys talk before we make decisions . # PM: And does anyone really want to go first ? # UI: I guess I'll go first . # UI: Component , I think . # PM: Components design . # ID: Presented by name . # PM: Your name is name ? # ME: Jose he man is . # UI: My name is name . # ID: My name is Inigo Montoya . # ID: You killed my father . # UI: I did this in a bit of a rush . # ID: Prepare to die . # UI: So so here's a look inside your really old-looking remote control . # UI: you've got a printed a printed circuit board here , and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes that activate # PM: We've all broke a remote control ri s . # UI: we've all broken a remote control . # UI: So you've also got you've got your chip here , your batteries here , and some sorta electronics . # ME: I just love you tech guys , huh . # ID: there's a thingy and a dingy and # PM: You press this and it does th # UI: so you've got here's a transistor , and this amplifies your signal , you've got the L_E_D_ here on the end of the uh on the end of the printed circuit board . # UI: you've got a couple diodes here for I don't know who and whatnot . # PM: I dunno who and whatnot . # UI: So we've got a i in this in this drawing he in this example here , this is a eighteen pin chip I dunno . # UI: it's two double A_ batteries . # UI: This is pretty standard remote . # UI: So here are options for our power sources . # UI: You can use a basic battery , which we've already discussed , th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that . # ID: I wanna change that . # UI: I don't know if that's really # ME: I gotta I gotta flashlight , and # UI: I don't know we got some qu crazy guys down there in that department so You shake it . # ME: but it's interesting 'cause you shake it like this . # UI: So that's the next bullet is the kinetic provision of energy , # ME: And that's on the camera . # UI: so it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it . # UI: we've got solar cells , which I don't think is a very good idea because you could not use your remote at night which doesn't make a lot of sense . # UI: And finally we've got our cradle o our power cradle idea . # PM: Okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here ? # UI: M battery versus cradle I think is . # ID: I like the kinetic . # PM: So we have battery versus cradle # ME: I g I figured you would . Yes . # UI: It could be fun . # PM: It's actually a novel thing because you could sell it a as a novelty , just to be actually serious for a minute here , you could # UI: Well it is it is more I mean it is more eco-friendly than the than the cradle 'cause you're still using power off the grid with the cradle . So our case design . # UI: We have choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do . # UI: Our material choices are a plastic latex ty or plastic , a rubber latex type thing , wood , or titanium . # UI: If we go with titanium we're gonna be limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it's tough to shape the titanium , and # PM: Wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche , wouldn't it . # UI: I think wood i # UI: I can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote , it's just anti-technology really , you know . # ME: to me in a marketing sense it's not it's not relative . # ME: We can we can o we can accentuate whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it . # UI: And what we may be able to do , and I think this might be the best option is to combine some a couple of these . # UI: my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell , to make it to mak like a thick plastic inner shell and a t kind of a to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable , and also maybe i I think it feels a little better than the plastic . # PM: 'Kay . Do you get a good grip on the rubber ? # ME: And if you make it from that super rubber , when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand . # ME: You don't even need to lean down to get it . # UI: The advantages of working with plastic and rubber is w we we'll have a lot more options just in terms of shape because you can extrude plastic in basically any shape you want . # UI: So and then we can cover you know the breakable bits with rubber so But basically these are curved and double-curved I believe that the tech department , in their in their message to me , that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom . # UI: I have no idea exactly what they're talking about , but that's what they told me , uncurved , flat , curved , or double-curved . # UI: I would guess this like this pen would be kinda like a double-curved , where it's curved on m multiple axes , right ? # UI: I think curved means just curved in one axis and double-curved is curved in two axes or surfaces . I have no idea . # PM: I think it might mean something like that sorta shape because a double curve rather than a # ME: that's what I see . # UI: Oh okay oh like a wave , okay . # ME: that's what I see also . # UI: Alright that makes sense okay . # UI: okay , with the interface we have the following options , we can u we can use push buttons , we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button , and L_C_D_ display , or multiple scrolling wheels . # UI: so these are all options that the user interface guy can has at his disposal to put together a user interface . # UI: For electronics , we have these very technical descriptions here . # UI: A simple chip , which is the least expensive , but I have no numbers to give you , a regular chip , which is like the medium porridge the medium expense # PM: D do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip ? # UI: the difference is , with a simple chip a simple chip will operate oh why doesn't this scroll up ? # UI: Previous previous , okay . # UI: A simple chip is required to operate push buttons . # UI: an advanced chip is required to operate the L_C_D_ display , and it didn't say specifically , but I have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels . # PM: that makes sense . # PM: So presentation from I guess design would go best . Next . # UI: That's the end of my presentation . # PM: Technical functions or interface concept ? # ID: Oh interface concept . # ID: Very long presentation . # PM: Yes , but it has your name on it . # ID: Well that doesn't bo bode well for it for it tats as well . # ID: somehow that thing's too big , but our manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition . # ID: They say they could put it to work but we don't think so . # ID: It it you'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and # UI: If the T_V_ is working , That's just I mean it'll if somebody says up in the middle of a television show , it's gonna change the channel . # ID: and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore , and I think that's one of the things we wanna keep . # PM: But what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize ? # PM: So if you pressed it and went , up ? # ID: That kinda would r d # UI: Well then why don't you just press the up button ? # ID: That would kind of lose it . # PM: But if it's just one thing with a button that you can just go # UI: Even still there's gonna be interf th there's there still will be interference from the T_V_ . # UI: It might not be it might not be completely confusing , but I think you'll still y it's still I don't think it's practical at all . # UI: I think it's a bad idea frankly . # ID: so taking that away , our the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable # PM: You guys know your stuff . # ID: it's the ones that would al would allow us to market our product as being you know less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it or you know mistreat misuses as it happens to remote controls . # ID: as for the point that we making about losing it . # ID: Well , we wanna small r remote control one side because we want it to be cool and designed , but apparently market shows that bigger s bigger remotes get less lost , # UI: That I would believe . # ID: But I think we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that . Somehow . # ID: so the what I would propose is something more or less in the direction of what is to yo the right of that slide but without with a l a less complicated design , so the numbers , the volume control , and channel control , and teletext access . # ID: the volume and channel control can just become those the four button array as in if it was a round dial . # ID: And if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext . # PM: So we're suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume ? # UI: That's not a scroll wheel . # ID: i it's just four buttons that are on a cross , # ID: so that you ba basically can control all of the important tasks from that alone . # UI: Instead of play , stop , rewind , and fast forward there , that's up , down , louder , and quieter . # ID: so I think we w we go for something mid-sized , so something looks good and is not too prone to get lost . # PM: So on to Y functional requirements or trend watching ? # UI: Trend watching has a later date there . # ME: Trend watching I guess . # ME: Trend watching I believe . # PM: forty six nineteen fifty seven . Yep . # ME: See what it looks like . # ME: It's been so long . # ME: Well I don't know what to say . # ME: When I s when I see the when I see the product I don't wanna buy it . # ME: I see so many of 'em out there . # ME: There's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there . # UI: Are you talking about the picture ? # UI: That's not our that's not our b design , that's just a that's just something he a graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like . # ME: Okay 'cause right now I don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we don't have a product to market yet . # ME: And from talking to Mike is that we have we have we can market a more expensive product now . # ME: That's what I understand so , # PM: Upper management said yes . # PM: e excuse that , that's a bit of spam . # ME: And and so I'm a I'm a little bit stuck right now in that what w what is it that I'm gonna market ? # ME: without special or increased marketable features I don't believe the product has a consumer demand . # ME: I like the idea of the scroll there are so many people making these products at this price right now . # ME: What are we gonna do to make this one special and unique ? # UI: What's special and unique about a scroll ? # ME: it's I just see it as different . # ME: I don't say it's specially mm I don't say it's special . # ME: I say that it's different I what I'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different . # ME: I give me a lower price , give me a higher price , give me some new technology , don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it's f at the same price . # ME: I need something to market about this thing . # ME: We're we're a new firm . # PM: I'd say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though , the then we have that as well , # ME: What i if when we have # PM: but wi with a similar # ME: when we when we have something like the cradle or something give that's as a marketing standard I need something to market , to make this product unique . # UI: Well right I think the two big th points that we have so far are the having the cradle and also having the actual design of the case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior , having it look really nice and also be really durable . # ME: Just remember when I made up this report I didn't have the information that we're discussing here . # ME: And and so when we have a cradle , when we have some kind of design , so what I'm saying is , from my perspective , I don't have a product to market right now . # ME: my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost , either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology . # ME: That's that is the next step , there's technology and then there is technology , which we're moving into the next phase . # ME: And so we're gonna have some new technology to enhance the marketability . # ME: again I'm not sold on the product because we don't have a product in my opinion yet . # ME: So I need a product . # UI: Well let's get a product then . # ME: I need a product to market . # ME: And I just whatever product you guys put together , we'll find a way to market it . # ME: Tha that I'm not concerned with . # ME: If you if you give me if you give me a cut-out of what everybody else has then I need to I need to find a lower cost . # PM: So our big questions here really are cradle or not cradle ? # PM: Do we go basic or do we go for features ? # PM: d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first ? # UI: Well my question is what would the scroll wheel do ? # UI: Function-wise , what does that do that # PM: Oh but that was in your presentation so wh what would you imagine it doing ? # UI: Well it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do . # ME: now what I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons . # ME: So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique . # ME: If it creates something more complex or more expensive , then I don't know if that makes it a marketing necessity . # ME: But again , from a marketing perspective I want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we're co it's a very competitive market . # PM: What I understand about scroll wheels is they're quite expensive to make . # UI: Th they are gonna be more expensive , but on the other hand , I mean , it I mean it is an alternative if you think that's gonna sell some you know if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe it's worth it to do it , but I mean I would just use if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down . # UI: I don't think volume or do you think volume would be # ID: I'll bet first in volume maybe . I dunno . # UI: No we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but # PM: Well I d I like the idea of basically focusing the my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the case the dock to put it in to charge it . # PM: We can target like environmentally friendly ideas , that sorta things . # PM: It s i m makes it easy to market , it's easy to differentiate the product , so . # ME: I think it's that's right . # PM: And if we keep the rest in a format that is durable because th the whole product's gonna need to be more durable th thus because you're not going to be ditching it as often . # PM: It's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle . # PM: So if we can market it in terms of that and well # ME: I think we got some exclusivity in that , you know , we got something that nobody else has right now , and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it's own demand from it's uniqueness . # PM: So our big decision then is like how do we do like we have to decide on the details and we have to decide on well n not exactly the details , but d do we have What type of casing ? # PM: I personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber . # UI: I'm thinking something like kinda almost like these pens , you know , where there's you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside . # PM: Just a very thin sorta sheet for a grip , sorta thing or for # UI: Well no ma maybe a bit more then th is on here but ju just as a kind of an inspiration , these pens I think are kind of # PM: So then if we d do we want to do anything more basic with the more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for buttons , or do we want if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go L_C_D_ ? # PM: Do we want to give do we want to have anything else on it ? # UI: Or from my perspective I think L_C_D_ is a mistake because this is a universal remote and all you're doing I mean it's you're not gonna get any information back from the television , so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last and there's just not a lot of information , you know , there . # UI: It receives no information . # UI: So I don't see any reason for having an L_C_D_ 'cause it's an increased cost . # UI: Unless you can think of something interesting to do with it . # ME: right now there's right now there's nothing coming out of the T_V_ to receive , so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the a cable box or something there's no s I don't see the , I don't see the necessity of an L_C_D_ either . # PM: Okay so the question is now I guess we need t to decide on well y you guys basically have to now go and figure out the details of this thing . # PM: So , what we need to know in terms of marketing and project management are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this ? # PM: What what overall things have we not decided on ? # UI: Well we have to I think for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be . # UI: There's the scroll wheel , in or out ? # UI: What do you guys like in the user interface ? # PM: I think maybe in terms of marketing , is that gonna make enough of a difference to justify the cost ? # ME: Again . Well I think it's the more uniqueness you can bring to the product , the easier it is , I believe , for me to market . # ME: again the push-buttons I see are everywhere . # ME: And so we can go with the same thing , but we're gonna be com competing in a in a broader market than if we go with something unique . # ME: You know the other thing I thought about was you know , do we go to something like this ? # ME: Make a remote that doesn't look like a remote . # ME: It's just another it's just a an idea , and I don't know # UI: Well I dunno about like the flip-phone idea , because I think , as far as durability th it's not a big well maybe when it's closed . # ME: I mean what I see one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is , when you got children , their stuff gets inside the circuitry , they get dirty , they get messy with drinks and stuff . # ME: And what I keep throwing out there I just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different . # ME: But you guys are the ones that have to c ultimately create the product within cost . # PM: and I guess th the question th that you're being asked right now is whether is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a as a very different product , or do we really need the scroll wheel as well ? # PM: Because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost . # ME: I think you gotta g get into cost effectiveness . # ME: I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator , I think those are two very strong features , if that's something that can be integrated without a bunch of extra cost . # UI: The locator's gonna require a radio transmitter , which will # PM: That's gonna n is that gonna need a better chip as well ? # UI: we're probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip , s I would imagine . # ID: No it's just different . # UI: But we I we will need a receiver , an antenna . # ME: So it's just I think that's # UI: It should be a really simple signal though so # ME: I know personally that would be a very attractive feature , is to have a have a button I can push to find my remote control . # PM: And it's presumably gonna need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep . # PM: But I guess a little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap , it's not gonna need q quality , is it ? It's # UI: Oh yeah . It'll be really cheap . # ME: Or maybe you can like have a smell-o-rama , you know you push a button and it s puts out a stink . # PM: Makes your living room more fresh as you watch . # PM: Okay we're doing well for time here . # PM: we've got about another ten minutes . # UI: So the scroll wheel , in or out ? # PM: Mm pr my personal preference is out . # PM: I don't think the cost is justified for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that , and I don't s think it's obvious and natural how it would be used . # ID: I think we have like and it's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing , 'cause it's it breaks down easier . # UI: For me I think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad . # UI: I don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be , but I think he does have a point , i it might push somebody over the edge when they're looking at our at our remote versus something else , when they see this one has a scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels . # UI: I think it might be kinda neat to be able to do it like that . # PM: But then that surely d depends a little on the T_V_ because some T_V_s are quite slow at changing channels from like so if you've got a scroll wheel and you s you have to scroll it really slowly just so that you're actually keeping in pace with the T_V_'s ability to change channels . # PM: Or do you have to go through and you wait for it ? # PM: You scroll it a bunch of times and you wait for it to # UI: Well I think wh what it would be is like the m like this , where it's maybe you know a digital wheel , right , where it's where it's quantized into you know certain # PM: That's where you # UI: That was that was my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be . # PM: I see I see what you're talking about now . Okay . # UI: It's just it's basically it it's just a f look and feel thing . # UI: It has the same exact functionality as two buttons . # ME: I think there's you know that there are so many people today that are that are surfing are television surfers , and I see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing . # PM: if you're just sitting there going # ME: Instead of going button-to-bu you just j you'd j . # PM: That's kinda cool actually . # ME: I really I really think that's a really cool thing for surfing . # UI: Now just so you know though you did bring up a point which is very valid , is a lot of T_V_s won't re the T_V_s won't respond exactly the same . # UI: Some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching , so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it'll be like flip , flip , flip . # ME: Well there's ano # PM: Well not n necessarily . # PM: You could basically make it so that it'll I mean it's just gonna be sending a signal to the T_V_ the T_V_'s ge so if you send about five flip channels , if you did that it's gonna flip once . # PM: If you do that . # UI: it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want , # PM: Other than click . # UI: but I think once people get used to it I do like the idea of the scroll wheel though . # PM: And if we're marketing it as a high niche product , then we're gonna be selling it to people who are buying good T_V_s as well , presumably . # ME: I think so . I think so . # ME: Now the only thing I on the interface side of it , is that I see the dilemma . # ME: But if we have the option of scrolling at any particular speed , or the option of jumping direct , okay . # ME: So I can go presuming I have , on my television , something that tells me what channel I'm on , I can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two . # ME: I know what because it's on the television . # ME: The television tells me what channel it's on when I change it . # ME: So I don't know that really that's gonna be a d problem , 'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button . Okay ? # ME: So ca can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system ? # ME: You understand what I'm saying ? # UI: I think I know what you might be getting at , or # PM: Oh I see so if maybe if we had an L_C_D_ up the top that just did a number on it , right ? # PM: And then it that basically # ME: we could read it from the television . # UI: Well , what about this what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favourite channels , # PM: Well that's quite cool . # PM: You'd need a display on the th the thing . # UI: It'll tell you when you flip the channel on the T_V_ . # ME: the television can tell you . # PM: Oh yeah no I see what you're talking about . # PM: that's kinda cool . # PM: How would you program it though ? # UI: Well you just it's one extra button . # UI: You say programme start , and then type in 'cause you still have the typing you know you'll still have the keypad where you can type 'em in manually . # UI: So programme start , zero , one , enter , zero , five , enter , thirty eight , enter , programme end . # PM: and that just basically flips between it and it'll go it sends out zero , five , and then thirty six , and then zero , one again . # PM: that's kinda cool . # ME: And again we have another great marketing tool . # ME: We have about three we have three or four things here . # PM: That's not gonna be too expensive because that's gonna be you're gonna be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really . # PM: You could basically come up with a partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply . # ME: I dunno and an maybe we maybe even have this as in-house technology . # ME: This may be something that's available through our own through our own services . # PM: Might be , but tha that's not gonna be such a costly feature . # PM: The problem we're gonna have is making it robust . # PM: Making it last . # UI: Oh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes , between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one , up two . # ME: Or we go directional up we go we go this we go this we go this way for one , we go this way for the other . # PM: So if there's a button for each type . # UI: because you wanna be able to go up and down through the channels . # PM: people are gonna have their favourite sorta , whether they do that or whether they # ME: Okay , okay , well then you just have , you have a diff you have a mode switch . # PM: the mode switch . # UI: I think we'll need a we'll need a mode switch , but then if we have a mode switch we're gonna need some kinda indicator # PM: Just the lights behind the buttons . # UI: to which , an L_E_ an L_E_D_ # PM: You could have back-lit buttons maybe . # PM: Would that work ? # PM: Is that okay we have five minutes . # PM: So right details th that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel . # PM: We want a mode indicator . # PM: We want back-lit buttons . # PM: And if we're making back-lit buttons period , do we want that just for the mode indicator or maybe to indicate what button you're pressing at the time , so that you know if it's actually pressed or not . # PM: I've seen some remotes do that . # UI: Just so you know I think I mean it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the mid-market range . # UI: It seems we're kind of approaching a higher-end range . # PM: I think we are . # UI: I wanna make sure everybody's okay with that . # ME: Well you had acknowledged that we have more money for this . # PM: well we don't have it's not that we have more money , # ME: Didn't you say so ? # PM: we can push up the price . # ME: That's what I mean . # ME: We can increase the cost . # ME: So I don't know I don't know whether having # UI: I just wanna make sure everybody's on board with it . So # PM: So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to , though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components . # PM: But I'd say what sorta price are we looking to be able to sell something like that , and what sorta price can we make it for ? # ME: Well I think th I think the design and technology has to come back and say , okay to create this product we see it's gonna cost us this much for this volume , because we do have a volume target of fifty million profit . # PM: I think that's where we really should be more flexible than anything else because as we said in the last meeting , our management is really looking for us to push our brand . # PM: We're entering a new market here , so I think the profit expectation for this one product is maybe not as important as being able to # ME: Okay I'm okay with that . # ME: I guess what I just want to me the next step is for these guys to come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached , and then we have to take this to the next level . # PM: But th what's our ballpark as to what we'd be able to sell something like this for ? # UI: Let's let's try and think now , how much would you pay for # ME: We have to find cost . # UI: with all these features how much would you pay if you went to the store , and you were in the market f to replace your T_V_ remote , how much would you pay for that ? # PM: But you've gotta think who our target market is because I I'm not our target market . # UI: I'm just asking you . # PM: I'm a student , but on the other hand I would think , mm with my Project Manager salary , I would think I could probably afford this # UI: Then you could probably afford this . # PM: would I buy it ? # PM: If I had a cool new T_V_ and this was r looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel , which I think's a really cool idea , that would sell me on it a little . # PM: Then maybe you know . I do I don't think I'd go over a hundred Euro certainly , that would be way too much , # PM: but the I would be happy paying over forty for it , I guess , but not much # UI: I would say thirty five to forty . # ME: , I was gonna say thirty five to fifty . # PM: Thirty five to fifty Euros is our sales bracket okay . # PM: So the question is what we ca we make it for . # ME: Because one of th one of the things we're marketing about this product is that this is the last one you will ever need to buy for your television . # ME: It's one of the marketing features in this . # PM: That's why the scroll needs to be really robust . # ID: Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber , robust , with scroll wheel , with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff , favourite channels , and with a cradle , and the locator . # UI: With a cradle , radio transmitters , and back-lit buttons . # UI: And it's gonna look sexy . # UI: It might look like clay . # ID: Okay so you can market pe depending on that ? # ME: Bas th that's easy . # ME: That's that's not a , it's a . # ME: 'Cause we have about six , six , seven features in that alone . # ME: Under the title of uniquenesses . # PM: The next meeting starts in thirty minutes , although does it ? # PM: It starts at three twenty one , the next meeting . # PM: So we've got more than a thirty minutes . # PM: we've got more like fifty . # ME: Well I have three twenty one is the next meeting ? # PM: The the ne next meeting is three twenty one . # ME: That's that's almost fifty minutes . # PM: they've changed the times from the presentations . # ME: You guys can You guys you guys can create a All kinds of things . # UI: We'll let you know when we're done , if we can go earlier . # PM: Okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and Okay are there any other questions with regards to what this thing's gonna do , look like , how it's gonna work that need to be addressed before we really look at this in a lot of detail ? # UI: I don't think so . # UI: If we have any questions we'll just email you I guess . # ID: I think it pretty much everything's covered . # PM: Okay . This one was quite easy . # ID: Coulda been worse . # PM: Always the optimist . # PM: 'Kay thanks guys . # ME: I don't have any emails . This means I can go home . # ME: Oh , we all leave .
# UI: Put on your mic . # ID: So you forgot how this works again ? # ME: Maybe . Maybe maybe . # PM: Okay so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , And here's the agenda for this meeting . # PM: I'm just gonna open , say a few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . # PM: You guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product that I can see some demonstrations of over there . # PM: And then we're gonna evaluate it . # PM: Then we're gonna talk about finance , and I've got a lovely Excel spreadsheet that I knocked up in the last five minutes for this . # ID: you knocked it up ? # PM: And we're gonna evaluate the product and close . # PM: Got forty minutes to do this in . # PM: We should be fine . # PM: Let's try and keep this one on schedule . # PM: Your thing is in where is it ? # ID: The end product thingy . # UI: Pedro can have it . # UI: I'll help talk . # ID: so what we ended up with . # ID: Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and the research department , which is us , is fifteen point eight Euros , someone forgot the units there # ID: , unit price unit production price cost thing . # ID: we implemented the basic functions , which is just T_V_ functions plus the locator , which was one of the marketing things , cradle , scroll wheel for the channels , and we implemented the f the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll . # PM: Zapping your favourite channels , eh ? # UI: Scrolling through your favourites list . # ID: Zapping you know zapping . # PM: 'kay okay , that's favourites . # ID: Maybe it's just a Portuguese thing . # ID: And that was the result . # PM: I like the logo on there as well . # UI: It's very prominent . # PM: It is very prominent . # PM: So this is the # UI: here I'll give you the so this is the cradle unit , and this is the actual remote itself . # UI: so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this green little scrolly guy here , and then the volume controls are here and here . # UI: you've got the keypad which is the numbers f from zero to nine and then ten . # UI: This is the power button . # UI: we have our we have the enter button and what was the other button here ? # UI: This is the teletext . # ID: Start s the start to # UI: The programme button , # UI: the programme button . # UI: So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your the type of television you wanna use . # UI: So the plastic is the white area of this of the model here , and the red area is like a rubber covering . # PM: It's pretty cool . # UI: So you can see that when it lays like this or like this and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it's pretty hard to actually damage it # PM: Is that could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ? # UI: that might be a possible a mi possible problem , but if you drop it # PM: Oh well I guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it . # UI: and it depends on if it's sliding , but I think it's pretty ergonomic . # UI: You can feel it . # PM: Mm . Feels good . # PM: I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well . # UI: Well this is clay . # PM: it's kinda cool . # PM: You have to reach a little bit don't you . # UI: the power button is a bit of a reach , but I think we might scale down the final model a bit . # PM: that wouldn't make sense . # UI: These this is a bit larger than it would be , but # PM: It's cool . I'm impressed . # ID: Don't have no one to handle that . # PM: And hold it so # PM: wh what's the marketing perspective ? # ME: oh that's oh I like it . # ME: I mean you guys gave me more than I was asking for , so I'm happy because we've got some really marketable features in this . # ME: I think it's good . # ME: Good good job . # UI: Mm Pedro can demonstrate the paging ability . # ID: So you ha you have like the base station with the little button for the where's my remote . # ID: The locator function . # ME: It's great . That's great . It's a great feature . # PM: Mm it's impressing . # ID: Wicked isn't it ? # PM: So let me get it , if I press this button # PM: I see . That's pretty cool . # UI: beep be shut up . # ME: So you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town # PM: I plan to do that as well . # UI: okay . no tha that's alri # PM: So the two blue are those for the it to charge off of in ? # UI: Exactly that's exactly what those are for . # UI: And there's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it , is you could beep we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger # PM: it's the right shape isn't it ? # UI: it it's it kinda feels like there should be something there , but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there . # UI: And we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so # PM: But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the problem of it landing and scrolling , 'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides . # UI: So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit , # ME: , I can see that . # PM: But it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that , hasn't it ? # PM: So is that the final colour scheme as well or ? # UI: Oh no this is just what we had to work with at the time . # UI: So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people . # PM: The scroll wheels , a problem with them not being sort of I don't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore . # ME: Well I mean of course , I mean My my s my suggestion is we're gonna go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions . # ME: You know some blend of silvers and blacks . # PM: Okay enough of that . # PM: Well i it's cool guys . # PM: 'Kay so are we done with the this presentation ? # ME: So you're not gonna find my folder up there I gotta do mine up at the board . # PM: Have you ? Okay . # PM: Can I not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now ? # ME: No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I cou I couldn't create it . # ME: I couldn't create it in the PowerPoint , and I think I've got this really strange cable . # ME: So what I had , basically going from the PowerPoint format , is that yeah I like this a lot . # ME: Is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room ? # ME: So what we had is we had the method . # ME: That's not how you spell method , is it ? # ME: So this doesn't go so fast this way . # ME: And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh . # ME: And to me with this product we got we got basically three things to market . # ME: We've got the features , we have the characteristics , and we have the I don't know what we would call the other part what we call you know the corp corporate Help me . # ME: The the corporation stands behind the product , okay . # ME: So the features I think we got the scroll , we've got the locator , we've got the durability , we've got the dependability , # ME: we've got you know the features that make this a unique product . # ME: the characteristics I talk about , we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive . # ME: and the corporation , we're talking about we're a new we're a new company . # ME: We're wanting to make a name for ourself . # ME: We're wanting you to find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price . # ME: One thing I would want to see is can we can we get a lifetime guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee , which means that this product , for the for the life of the life use , if it should have a technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ? # ME: That was something I would be interested in . # ME: without going into great details , we have a we have a product , it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , I believe , to make it marketable I believe at a cost of thirty five to fifty Euros . # ME: We're gonna be competitive , and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche . # PM: would you a argue that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ? # ME: That that would be that would be I think a decision best made by corporate for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , I th I think that we can go after this and go after more of the exclusivity sense than the mass market sense . # ME: But I'm sh I'm sure open to market this in either direction . # ME: But you guys came up with a great product , and at that cost I think it there's nobody else that's putting this combination of ingredients together . # ME: The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only . # ME: that's the only that's the only drawback I see to this . # ME: But with all of these other features I think people c one thing I'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice . # ME: There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my but I like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back . # PM: And we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway , aren't we ? # PM: Th there's no fundamentally different technology to do that . # ME: Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can this unit be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ? # ME: You know like a sim card in a in a in a telephone . # ME: You know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after # ID: W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but # ME: but you follow what I'm s I'm s # ID: we could get another version of it that actually works . # ME: 'cause if we can make this unit upgradable then we're but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything , but that's that was just an idea I had . # ME: to me the only additions # PM: , the plus there's the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , you know what they do , it's very simple , and it just works . # PM: Mm there's a risk of that . # ME: But anyway that's # PM: Okay so we can talk about finance now . # PM: So I have a little spreadsheet for us I was wondering , you when you talked about the fifteen point eight Euros , I was wondering how you came up with that figure ? # UI: Well , that was just our technical team added up the production costs of the individual units . # PM: so I have bit of a spreadsheet here for this . # ID: Very co very colf colourful . # PM: I've made a f few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros , equivalent to solar cells , which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already . # PM: and I'm assuming that the locator beacon , the you know the # PM: Can be made for it sounded different that time can be made for a similar price to an L_C_ display , # PM: do you think that's fair coming from a m the manufacturing ? # UI: I do think we that we don't need the events chip on print , we only need the regular chip on print , so there may have been a m miscalculation in there . # PM: So we're down to sixteen point four , . # UI: And we and we have a single-curved # PM: Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved ? # PM: We're not entirely sure what single-curve versus double-cur # ME: We've got a we've got a curve and a droop . # ME: I don't know whether that . # UI: It's single-curved , # PM: I'm convinced . # PM: But we save one Euro that way , ? # PM: So we come bring it down to Fifteen point four . # UI: See it's a little bit more than f single-curved . # UI: So it's fifteen point eight , that's where we came up with it . # PM: Do don't speak so it's in here , in that w do we have any we have special form don't we ? # UI: What do you know . # PM: But the we haven't talked about any special colour though I don't th # UI: Oh it's a that's not very special , it's pretty # PM: if we're going for greys and silvers then I don't think we're O okay so we're Push-button , scroll wheel , we're basically we have th # PM: is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll ? # UI: That's a scroll . # PM: Just a scroll ? # PM: It's not one of the scrolls where , for example , with this one you could push it down to be a button ? # UI: no we just use it as a scroll . # PM: then we have fifteen point eight Euros . # UI: It was a pretty accurate estimate I would say . # ID: We're wicked . Awesome . # PM: Okay so we're on to the # UI: S 's kind of s frighteningly accurate . # PM: We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation , where we have a look at the criterias th that Paul the criterion criteria that Paul has given us , and we can use that to tell How's it going ? # PM: Anyone got any thoughts ? # PM: How how have we done today ? # UI: I think we did pretty well . # PM: I think we did pretty well too . # PM: That looks pretty spectacular . # ME: No , I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable product and concept . # PM: Any other chang thoughts ? # PM: Okay so th what about room for creativity ? # UI: Sh I think there was plenty of room . # PM: I think we ended up being quite creative there . # UI: We got a couple innovative i Couple innovative ideas . # ME: well we kinda broke we kinda at least adjusted every criteria they gave us because we d we still have the teletext capability in this thing right , we raised the price of it , we've added two t new technology to it . # ME: So you know you know if this thing flies then we've adjusted or broken every idea they gave us . # PM: Not every idea necessarily , # PM: it's still a remote control . # PM: but we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess , but the # ME: But I like I mean when I say we have we had I believe we have room for creativity 'cause w this is we did it . # PM: 'Kay leadership , what do we report back to the bosses ? # PM: No th I think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing . # ID: It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was # UI: There was a lot of synergy . # ME: Yes synergistic . # PM: Teamwork , What did we think of the meeting room , I guess is an important thing here . # UI: These cables suck . # PM: , this falls off and the white board worked really well without any pro # ID: And that's D you must have very long shirts . # ID: That's way far down lapel mic . # PM: Wha okay , oh , alright . # ID: That's almost a crotch mi cr # PM: That's it's down , it's quite close . # ME: You know you know what they're gonna have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting you know th # PM: Keep it , keep it calm . # PM: Oh dear . No more pizza for me . # ID: Oh dear oh dear . # PM: So the pen came in alright and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works . # ID: 'Cause this is you were using it o upside down . # UI: That's our boss . # PM: Nah , I'm not convinced of that at all . # PM: I've been wor I've been wondering about that all day , but see these look like they're that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around , # ID: Use them like that . # UI: Pedro's right . # PM: but it feels more comfortable , wh what you call upside-down . # UI: Pedro's right . # PM: okay so that data might be slightly invalid . # PM: What new ideas have we found ? # ME: New ideas f for the product or for the environment or # PM: Well let's do both then . # ME: what are we ta # PM: for the product ? # UI: Well we had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle , and the r remote call feature . # PM: we came up with quite a bit . # ID: Bunch of new ideas . # PM: And for the meeting room , Has anyone got any more # ID: comfortable headsets would be nice . # PM: less sore on the ears . # ME: Well I mean clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a nice solution to all these cables , but I'm sure that there's some justification for these things that I don't know about . # ME: And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon . # ME: It's not been it's not been cooperating so well , but I don't think that's the that's avoidable . # ID: Coulda been worse . # PM: Okay so Are the costs within the budget ? # PM: Oh hang on it really that's something we that the costs were under twelve fifty Euros . # PM: No requirements are changed . # PM: We're still under twenty Euros to build , so we're good . # PM: And the costs within the budget ? # PM: Not the original budget , but they are now . # PM: Is the project evaluated ? # PM: Mm I think so , then celebration as it says . # ID: Free coke provided at the cafeteria . # PM: Oh I don't know how that got there . # ID: Who wrote that one ? # ME: So we need to close this meeting , bravo . Congratulations . # UI: Good job guys . # ME: S I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on so let's close this and come back and 'kay . # PM: , I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on too .
# PM: Suppose I have to do my presentation . Eh # ID: It's Ada Longmund ? # PM: I'll present myself , I'm Ada Longmund , and as you may know it , I'm the pr project manager . # PM: we will have to speak about m the project . # PM: Our project is to create a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . # PM: the project method is the following . # PM: if we're the functional design , you have to do any individual work and also work with meetings talking with each other . # PM: it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design . # PM: The tool training is to try out the white board , # ID: Maybe someone ha we have to this whiteboard , # PM: Maybe you can draw your favourite animal and make a list of its favourite characteristics . # PM: I don't know if we have to do it now , maybe later . # UI: I think you can do it . # PM: the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros . # UI: Twenty five Euros ? # PM: I think it's quite good price , . # ID: I it's reasonable , s quite . Twenty five . # ME: It's reasonable , I think , . # PM: it will be a an international remote control , as we want to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes . # PM: as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your with the remote control . # PM: just maybe be imaginative with remote const con controls , try to create something new and people would like to buy . # PM: And and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes , you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know I suppose you know what you have to do . # PM: you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications . # ME: Those things just refer to each of each of us , I think . AMI # ID: I_D_ is for the Industrial Design , And U_I_D_ , it's for the User Interface Designer , # ME: and Marketing Expert , it's me . # PM: I will manage all the group . # ID: you will be the manager # ME: You can manage all this , . # PM: you have questions ? # PM: you all know what the parts of the work you have to do . # ME: you , the Industrial Designer . # UI: I'm user interf I'm user interface design . # ID: I am the Industrial Design , # ID: I am the Industrial Designer so . # UI: Okay . So what's the difference between user interface design d industrial design ? # ME: I mean , you have to know . , you have to know it . # ID: It's difficult . # ME: It's your job , so I hope you know what it is . # ID: You know very soon . # PM: I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it . # UI: so I make u user interface . # UI: You you de you implement the core functions in the # PM: And i maybe you will transform it . # ID: I think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so # ID: And the industrial design , it is how the object will look like . # UI: Maybe I think uh i industrial design's , it's the function design . # UI: I design the user f user interface , you design the function . # PM: Maybe , it is the outside and the inside . # ID: But I was thinking that he's a user 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be , you know . # ID: But I don't know . # ID: I'm the industrial designer . # ME: Not the other one . # ID: Okay . So and the marketing expert will # ME: I'm just go I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have and then thi this would I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer . # PM: And when designing y the remote control just remember that it has to be a kind of international product . # PM: So you don't have to do something really specific , as everybody will have to use it , it's sor the same as keyboards . # PM: You know , you have Qwerty , Azerty , French and U_K_ keyboard , so really the remote control to be international . # PM: And not too expensive . # PM: As we want to maximise the benefit . # UI: And easy to use . # ME: And you have to keep it under twelve Euros and f fifty , so . # PM: you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty Euros . # ME: That's the problem . # PM: And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now . # ID: There was a step about drawing something in the in the board , I don't know . # ME: maybe should go and draw an animal . # ID: Are we supposed to do right now ? # UI: you try . Try first . # ID: Oh right it's from the left to the ri It's # PM: you think we have to do it now ? # ID: I d I was thinking but I n I'm not sure now . # UI: You can draw something which is very simple . # PM: You want me to draw something ? # PM: Product manager # UI: maybe we should bring Kemy here . # UI: Kemy is really good at drawing . # ID: I think everybody should do it , It's not matter So . # UI: You're going to draw ? # ME: it's the same as mine . # ID: It's a It's a cat . # ID: It is not a fat cat . # ME: It's the fat cat , okay . # UI: Can you draw rabbit ? # ME: That's difficult . # ID: you have to draw a rat if you want a rat . # PM: No . A mouse is not too difficult . # PM: Mouse is okay . # ME: Just go , you the closest to the whiteboard . # ID: right , but in grow , it's everybody has to grow # UI: Oh . Okay , The only thing I can draw is like this . # PM: You love the eyes . # ID: What are you I don no idea , so # PM: , that was the eyes . # ME: Bugs Bunny one . # ID: It's not so bad # UI: The only thing I can draw , because it's very simple . # ME: This was my favourite one , # ID: So you don't have a # ID: That's a that's a fish ? # ID: let's try to draw something . # PM: You forgot the chips . # ME: doesn't look so fine . # ID: Have to be really careful . # PM: Fish and chips . # ME: it's your turn . # UI: No problem , no problem . # ID: what can I draw some more ? # ID: it's a se it's my priority this one . # ID: It's a really crazy dog Transfer . It's a dog in a village . # ID: what are you sug going to do now ? # ME: I think it's done . # PM: Just have to present project , # UI: we have break . # PM: discuss a little bit about it . # ME: we have twenty five minutes for the meeting . # PM: if you have questions . # ME: Know what time is it ? # PM: You know your job ? # PM: you know your job ? # ID: We have an idea . # PM: You know your job ? # ID: I have an idea of my job .
# PM: I will open our functional design meeting . # PM: I will play role of the secretary . As also Program Ma Manager . # PM: we will have the three presentations from the In Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and # ID: Industrial Design . # ME: Marketing Expert . # PM: What's your talk ? # PM: Marketing Experts . # PM: And after that we will have the new product requirements , the decision on the remote control functions , and we will close the meetings after . # PM: I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer . # PM: , so you're participant two ? # ID: Three three , it's three # PM: I'm participant one . # PM: Okay , never mind . # PM: did you save your presentation ? # PM: Isn't that technical functions ? # ID: So you didn't save it maybe . # ME: it's David Jordan . Course . # PM: Name's Jordan . # ID: David Jordan ? . # PM: so I'll I let David Jordan do his presentation . # ME: this one doesn't want to be moved , I think . # ID: Too great for email then . # UI: The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our remote T_V_ control . # UI: I will focus on user interface design . # UI: so move to the next slide . # UI: As we know our remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture . # UI: There's a lot of functions . # UI: Over , I think over s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control . # UI: So how can we design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ? # UI: , let's move to next slide . # UI: so we want to design elegant , easy to use inter interface . # UI: A very good example is Google . # UI: As we know Google it's a very successful because his powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface . # UI: move to next s slide . # UI: So my job is to design a Google T_V_ controller which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface . # UI: That's the end of the talk the end of the presentation . # PM: So you propose to have the remote control which will be powerful . # UI: With sophisticated functions , # UI: but with very powerful . # PM: many functions and very easy to use . # ME: I dunno , it's maybe difficult to have both , # ID: To merge the two system huh . # ME: I mean the one on the right doesn't look so simple # PM: You mean this one ? # PM: you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , I suppose . # UI: But if we have very good user interface # UI: it take less time for user to learn how to use it . # ID: you maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are or almost the same , so the sign . # PM: you mean for the pic pictograms or things like that ? # ID: For example , I dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same . # ME: Oh it should okay , . # ME: The user should know . # ID: So you have to The sh the user there for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that # PM: such as maybe the Go on , go back # ID: but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright . # ME: that's gonna be the trick . # ID: That's your job # UI: It's not the easiest I've got to . # PM: you will propose us something which is so powerful and easy to use . # UI: Powerful and easy to use . # ME: So that's the point . # UI: , that's the point . # PM: next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things . # ID: Participant two . # ID: The rationale must be design , or # PM: Baba is the Industrial Designer . Okay . # ID: we can move to the next slide . # ID: As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know to give an industrial design of the remote control . # ID: So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_ . # ID: this one is leather bu based I propose a nifra infrared base you know , so for me I think that it is better it's bet it's better to control T_V_ so you know , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know For the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to # PM: So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ? # ID: I think it's cheaper than laser , so . # PM: Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ? # PM: Twelve , nearly thirteen , # ME: What the cost is ? # ME: Twelve , twelve a half . # ID: I think for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have uh Let's see . # ID: You can move to the next slide , so . # ID: So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here and the bulb it will be somewhere inside . # ME: That might just So . # ID: You can go to the next slide . # ID: I have some kind of pictures you know , You have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff you know and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so . # ID: This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device . # ID: But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and . # ID: and the next slide , it is the last one it's So it's I think it should be wire wireless re remote con Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know because you f the b the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . # ID: Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless . # ID: Okay , so if you have some question I didn't answer ? # ME: What's the average price of this technology then ? # ID: the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so . # ID: Or at least you know , the # UI: So what , the wireless remote control ? # UI: There's a wire with remote control ? # ID: It's so bres you have to decide how you will you know , put some energy inside , you can think about wireless or you know it's a question that we can raise , so . # ID: We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire . # ID: We can have both also . # PM: So you think that a cable between the remote control and the T_V_ won't be a good idea . # PM: maybe it will be cheaper I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu # ME: But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a # UI: Wireless remote control . # ME: I don't think well , I don't think he would , # ID: but some pa I always want to have you know , # ME: but in a sense # ID: sometime I want to have wire because you know . # PM: but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? # PM: I'm just asking you . # PM: Do you think it will be cheaper ? # ID: , I don't think it will be too much . # PM: Could you answer please ? # ID: Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's I think that you know you can always you know I think wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical , so . # PM: but I think the wireless problem is more the David Jordan's problem . # PM: I think it's more your problem . # PM: Mayb maybe you have just to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not . # ID: but , it should be an agreement , you know , because even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the g Graphical User Designer , but you know . # ID: If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the money you have , if you want to use , so it can be good to have a wireless , it is a question . # PM: just think of the usability . # UI: Design a wireless remote control . # PM: Just think of the problem . # PM: If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ? # PM: I think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television , # ME: that's actually one of the point , This you will see in my presentation then . # PM: So I will let you to do your presentation , so . # ME: Which is participant four . # ME: So just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else . # ME: We've made a study , so could you go to next slide . # ME: Sorry for the functional recurrence . # ME: So that's the standard method for marketing , We had one hundred subjects , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , and see what was okay or not for them . # ME: So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . # ME: actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls ugly , so that's # PM: You mean the loo the look , the outside ? # ID: The look , how it look like . # ME: , the look is bad for them it's your job , David , maybe . # ME: Then eighty percent of users would spend more money actually if the remote controls were not so ugly . # ME: So this is where we could have , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more . # ME: it's interesting information , I think . # ME: And then , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . # ME: we should change this as well . # ME: And users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . # ME: And , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . # ME: And this is one of the main point for me . # ME: But I'll come back to it later . # ME: Could you go next slide ? # ME: , so as you said , remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . # ME: this is from the experiments we've done , so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think . # ME: it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . # ME: And remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users . # ME: R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same doing the same movement several times , then you get injured . # ME: those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . # ME: so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . # ME: If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our concurrent , And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of functions , but less buttons , # ME: this would definitely be a good way of selling more . # PM: And just to have an idea , do you think you as the User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ? # UI: , I think possible . # UI: Because we can We can mix several function in one button . # UI: So lets you then you have less buttons . # PM: but do you think it will be easy to use ? # UI: But I'm not sure # PM: Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know . # ME: remember the user is not happy to read the # UI: you can have a switch menu , so you can # PM: but it has to be intuitive . # UI: for example , I think so . # UI: Like for example you can you can category the function i into several classes . # UI: Then for you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it tend to this kind of this category of functions . # UI: Then you put the switch button , then it switch to another category of functions . # UI: For example , if you have remote control you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your recorder . # UI: So there's a different functions , but i if you there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder . # UI: So we can has less buttons . # UI: But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy , not funny . # ID: This is a question that should be asked to the If you ask the people , maybe the marketing people . # UI: Because different people have a different opinion about fancy . You know . # ME: this is something we sh # UI: Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people , but maybe simple and uniform colourful is fancy for some for other peoples , so . # ME: But this was first step and This was the first step , . # ID: I think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard # PM: but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control . # ME: Specially distribution , . # PM: If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more . # UI: , personalised colour . Because you know # PM: , it will cost little bit more . # UI: because maybe some people prefer a red remote control , some people prefer black remote control . # ME: but this is what we would ask to the users , so . # UI: Maybe we can have di we can have several options , so user can select which colour they prefer , so . # PM: but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases , # ME: remember it's twelve Euros . # PM: and we don't really want the price to be too high , because we wanna be able to produce it . # PM: we want something fancy , as previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot . # PM: And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on T_V_ . # PM: I think you have quite lot of points to think about and to discuss it with the other members . # PM: is it okay for your presentation ? # PM: Nothing else to add ? # ME: , it's done , just . If we would if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it . # PM: I had some new information about the product requirements , so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . # PM: the first one is that for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext . # PM: you will have to think about it in your in the design of your remote control , and also the remote control will only be used for television , for y for you your designing , you're not you won't be you won't had buttons to just to manipulate to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that . # PM: because if we want to do remote control which will be used for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that . # PM: We really want to focus on the remote control for the television . # UI: But there's balance between function and the cost . # PM: So maybe it will be easier for you to design it , to have very powerful and easy . # PM: And also we want the image of the real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan . # PM: I mean that's if you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product . # PM: So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um of the of real reaction and also # ME: So has to be yellow . # PM: As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use . # PM: Require lot of requirements , # ID: For cheap remote control , . # PM: But that's your job to find something mm matches . # ID: 'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet , so . # ME: I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway . # ME: It's maybe more in browsing . # ID: but this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web . # UI: there's that box in o of it . # UI: There's that box in the T_V_ , so with the set box you can connect internet with your T_V_ . # UI: It's not so popular now . # ID: It's pop I don't think it's popular , so that's the problem so . You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know the global usage , # ID: so if people don't have the technology . # PM: So everybody is okay with the new requirements ? # UI: So I so As as for the colour , what do you think ? # PM: I think it has to be yellow . # ID: Do you think that people like the colour yellow ? # UI: Yellow ? T_V_ remote control ? # PM: Maybe you can change the colour , but the image of the society has to be recognised . # ID: I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_ . Or should be . # PM: Why you go It has to be fashion . # ID: Doesn't need to be completely yellow , # PM: So you have to # PM: It has to be a fashion and really be the image of the society . # PM: Just when you enter you say oh , oh , it's real reaction . # PM: Think it's a re reaction remote control , so . # PM: And also it has to be attractive , of course , because if you want to sale to sell the remote control . # ME: Regarding the first line , what So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext . # ID: But I dunno , but why , nobody's a threat to me . # ME: It's already changed for # PM: I think it would be simpler . # PM: Okay . So I will close the meeting , just after that we'll have lunch break . # PM: And you will have in thirty minutes individual work . # PM: You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put pon # ME: Industrial Designer . # ID: Industrial Designer , . # ID: Component component , . # PM: and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept . # PM: And Florent to work my subject . # PM: And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . # PM: I think the session is closed . # PM: And by the way , Mister David Jordan , please record your presentations in your own folder . Not in mine . # ID: Okay , that's clear . # PM: Should be better .
# PM: let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . # PM: as the previous meeting I will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . # ME: y you do the minutes first , # PM: I think I will let our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan . # PM: technical accessoire ? # UI: first I will present the concept of user interface . # UI: there's three concepts in the user interface . # UI: So first one it's a Google controller . # UI: The second is a fancy controller . # UI: The last one is intelligent controller . # UI: So there are three concepts in our controller . # UI: n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller . # UI: I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . # UI: So it's a combination of easy to use and sophisticated functions . # UI: this is a first concept of our controller . # UI: The second concept is a fancy controller , we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , the u the user f the u user interface should be very cute , very g # UI: Such like this , there are several examples in the slides . # PM: I'm not sure the one in the middle is very attractive . # UI: it's very , you know # UI: if you're It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . Or to recognise it , # PM: We'll have big discussion I suppose after that , # UI: the last concept is intelligent . # UI: We want we want our controller to be smart , so maybe we should use technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and gesture recognition . # UI: With this advanced features we I think we can attract a lot of user . # PM: Something else ? # UI: this is the three concepts of our controller . # PM: I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , but as the expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . # PM: Do you think they will be able to use gestures ? # PM: Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? # PM: or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . # PM: You don't think so ? # UI: I think some time it's very convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . # UI: For example , if you cannot find your controller , you can just speak something such as , one two . # ID: Oh , that's a good that's a good point , so . # PM: but suppose you got a cold . You have a mute remote controller . # UI: So you can use your gesture . # UI: That's no problem . # ME: but how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ? # UI: For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very # PM: but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? # ME: But this but this would never happen anyway . # UI: they cannot speak at the same time . # PM: If you have one brother and one sister and they want to watch their favourite T_V_ programme , # PM: so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , # UI: it's very interesting . # ID: but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control because the # ME: I don't think it # PM: but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you . # PM: You're not you're not obliged to share it . # ME: Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff . # UI: that's the advantage of intelligent controller . # UI: Even you h you have the controller , I can I can say channel three , # UI: so it's c come to channel three , # ME: No , but this is disadvant disadvantage . # UI: I don't have to # PM: , I think it's a disadvantage . # UI: It's advantage . # ID: And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to # PM: but one other question . # ID: manual controllers , eh . # PM: How how much will it cost ? # ID: more expensive maybe . # PM: Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working . # UI: we d we just are use # PM: Some some efficient . # ME: if you if you use the basic # UI: we just have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field . # PM: you think it won't cost an Not a lot for us ? # UI: I think it's because this technology is for limited wor or limited wor lexical recognition , it's very # ME: But it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . # ME: Because then you need I mean this doesn't have the power to do recognition , for example . # ID: y you have also the language problem , # UI: Even for the f because the vocabulary the # ID: you know when you 'Cause it have to be universal , # UI: The vocabulary is very small , so that's not a problem . # PM: but there is one problem that Baba talked about is the international remote control . # PM: We need something that is international . # PM: Suppose we're we want to sell it in France . # PM: The recognition system will be able to understand French . # PM: If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English , # UI: the key , the key the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some adaptation # ME: this could be downloaded by the web maybe , # ID: but you know . The product The pro # UI: It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . # UI: It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French . # ID: It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe # PM: And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? # UI: Because of this product this technology has already been developed . # PM: but how will you # ID: but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . # ID: If you have the language , you have to develop for each country . # UI: tha that's why we have to do language adaptation . # ID: but for each country you have to do one , because the for example for Se # UI: Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d we would we have to do adaptation to # PM: Seems to be quite complex . # UI: No , it's not so complex . # ME: we have to take care of the twelve Euros # PM: And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ? # PM: And where will be they ? # PM: Do you think if we're far from television it will work ? # UI: No no it's not I think that's n that's not a problem because you don't have to wear a microphone . # UI: It it just the microphone is embedded in the controller . # PM: but where is the controller ? # UI: Where is the controller ? # UI: It's in your family , in your home . # ME: but then it's like this # PM: here it's an object . # PM: But here you say you want to use i s technology . # UI: you can you can embed it microphone here . # ID: A microphone maybe . # PM: but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . # PM: If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object . # ID: To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe . # PM: You just want to interact with television . # UI: just you just put the controller here , then you # ID: I if you say one , he switch to channel , # UI: you use your command and you do s your gesture . # PM: but you can lose it . # UI: it's n y if you lose it # ID: So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one . # PM: you so you can build a kind of black box and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . # ID: but so you need a camera and you know a microphone inside your remote control . # ME: But you would still have the buttons . # ME: Or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? # ME: Or you still have the possibility to use buttons ? # UI: think it we should give the flexibility to the user and we think You can see they can switch form one modality to another . # ME: It's a bit risky . # PM: And maybe it will be quite # UI: that's quite inter quite attractive . # ID: But I think that , you know , switching from one country to another will be a problem , so although y # UI: if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . # UI: We should have confidence in technology . # PM: what do you think ? # PM: We'll try the controllers you'd prefer . # PM: Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ? # ME: I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . # UI: More features , # ME: But if it like doubles # ID: I think he need a control that is very reliable , # ME: no one would be interested . # PM: I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller . # PM: Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ? # PM: Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . # PM: You think it's possible ? # UI: but if you stick to stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? # UI: There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? # UI: Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some function inside it that # ID: It's not really the we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so or something like that . # ID: But I think a user need # UI: you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . # UI: You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function , # ME: but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something , # ID: Don't have a the if we can send email from it . # UI: But it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it's also the issue of the T_V_ . # ID: Because the p the problem I can see with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i for example if # ME: Cause for example . # UI: but we do we do we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , # PM: but we want so # UI: but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . # ME: you wou you would # UI: the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products . # PM: but w we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone . # ID: And for all the person of the family maybe , # PM: You don't need to tune it . # UI: if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ? # ME: I mean , for example the goo y # ID: Because you have new # ME: you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller . # ME: I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google . # ME: Google is simple , works fine , so I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot . # UI: but there's no big difference between the traditional controller . # ME: thi this the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition # ME: if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks nice and it's easy to use , easy to use . # PM: Not too expensive too . # UI: But the there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller . # UI: That's the same # ME: That's the problem , I mean , I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever . # ME: But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product # ME: I mean , that's the point . # PM: let's go to the Industrial Designer . # PM: Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that , # ID: , participant two # ID: , working design , I think Can you go to the next one ? # ID: it's not this one . # ID: It's oth the oth so I It's the working design . # ID: Component design . # ID: So this so this is the described use Are you inst # PM: I think there's something wrong with your # UI: It did didn't r receive it . Didn't receive it . # PM: Maybe you record it somewhere else . # ID: I don't think so . # UI: Participant one . Participant one . # PM: Interface concept . # ID: Maybe I record recorded directly on the Computer . # ID: Okay , okay . Yes . # PM: It seems that we have a problem with the # ME: I dunno if you remember what you had to say # ID: I can say it to you without . # UI: maybe we can first come to # PM: I think it will be more interesting to start with # UI: to Frahan . With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides , # ME: I think it's more interesting what he says , # UI: then present it later . # PM: You will had s some more information in I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have Baba's presentation . # ID: In fact , I don't know , because i in my presentation I don't have here with # PM: Okay , never mind . # ID: It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r of the remote control . # ID: So it will be interesting so I could show you some picture of what is inside I in fact the f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , will it will be wooden di wooden remote control or a plastic remote control like this one . # ID: in which kind will be the different bu button , it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , or , you know , you can see them in the darkness . # ID: the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example d solar energy alimentation or will it be a battery like the classical battery And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have both of them , for example in some country where you are in the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities for example in some place in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . # PM: , I think it's an added value to the remote control and maybe it can attract all the ecological k consumers # PM: but about the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , # ID: Alrigh In fact , having them both will if we want to have battery , regular battery and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price , but it will be an added value also that will be compensated , # PM: And what tha what about the materials ? # ID: And the materials , it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common # ID: it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class , # ID: or you know , you can have some # PM: and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . # ID: , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood and it can be interesting . # PM: Mm okay , seems to be interesting , mm . # ID: the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . # PM: we want something easy to use and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough . # PM: And you think that we will be # ID: I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros , # PM: And what about the buttons ? # ID: I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know lighted buttons because , you know , it's I don't know , in the dark , it's fashion # ID: and it's related to how beautiful it is or if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right . # ME: What about the touch scr touch screen ? For example . # ME: It's it's expensive I guess . # ID: I think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so . # ID: But And it is a kind of other design , I mean . # ID: It can also be interesting to have this kind of # UI: you got email ? # PM: I think we have only five minutes left . # PM: Participant four ? # PM: Functional requirements ? # ME: trend watching . # ME: The other one . # ME: , I think so , just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . # ME: user really want a fancy look and feel . # ME: They're not so interested in functional look and feel , Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and I mean i it sounds good technically but it's not what they want second point is they still want it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . # ME: At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . # ME: that were the three first points from the remote control analysis . # ME: Now i if we look at fashion in general Wha what we really see this year is that everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is inspired by fruits and vegetables , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the thing . # ME: 'Cause it's really what people want . # ME: Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . # ME: And then if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . # ME: the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . # ME: Then easy to use it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones . # ME: So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion from Milan and Paris # ID: And fruit and vegetables # ME: we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . # ME: And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , # ME: okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design . # ID: but the problem is which kind of material do you need to be spongy ? # ME: thi this is this would be like plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like # ID: Very stuff Okay , rubber desi okay , . # ME: device , tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend in fashion . # PM: we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . # PM: as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , # ME: , so when I think it's # PM: maybe will attract # PM: pro-ecology consumers . # PM: cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be enough to have something working well . # PM: So you think case . # PM: Something spongy . # PM: Someth no wood . # ID: No wood but Plastic ? # ME: Maybe not no wood , but I mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know . # ID: I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . # ID: It depends on the design we want , # ME: , maybe the base . # PM: It's it's natural . # PM: Th The feeling is natural , # PM: so maybe we can stay with wood . # ID: And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol # ME: I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view . # ID: Mm , it's not right , # PM: But it's still fashion . # ME: But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , I dunno . # PM: something that you can into it . # PM: and what about the user interface concept ? # PM: Google and fancy ? # ID: and fancy , how about the voice ? # PM: Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . # ID: maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested and how It is an interesting concept to see to have voice control . # UI: The smart controller . # ID: But and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , # PM: but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice . # ID: But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , # PM: So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , # PM: maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . # PM: And L_C_D_ buttons . # PM: I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add . # ID: And pf what can we think a supplement to # ME: What interface ? # PM: for the interface something added value . # ID: I think the supplement can be the voice . # ID: It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of # PM: With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers . # ID: To push button , Even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four . # PM: Turning the T_V_ o on o or off . # ID: Not very complex commands , but easy commands , # PM: adding some vocal commands . # PM: the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes we'll you will all have to work in your direction . # PM: So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the simple vocal commands recognition . # PM: you will have to work more , Baba , on the spongy way to add spongy touch to the buttons # ID: expensive buttons to make some new # PM: and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . # PM: And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too . # ME: no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends . # PM: And remember as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and the colour of the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . # ID: Need it to be , okay . # PM: So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us modelling a cl a clay remote control , so you will have to model something . # PM: And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . # PM: no more questions , we can close the session .
# ME: No not really # PM: Your judgement it's is biased . # ID: I'm afraid thi this remote control will stay a prototype . # ME: so whe where is the remote control ? # PM: let's go for our detailed design meeting . # PM: So I will still play the role of the secretary , we'll have first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan , and our Industrial Designer , Baba . # PM: So we'll have to evaluate the your proposed remote control , and have an idea of the price that this thing will cost . # PM: And in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the production . # PM: maybe I will let the our two designers talk about so their # UI: I have slides . # PM: You have s oh , sorry . # ID: Effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything . # UI: Product prod # UI: So , this is our product or prototype . # UI: This is made by clay . # PM: Looks strange . # UI: the basic colour is yellow and red . # UI: Yellow is our company colour , red it's is more attractive . # UI: So we used two basic colour , yellow and red . # UI: And the shape , there's two basic shape . # UI: The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece . # UI: we call it a mushroom design . # UI: It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design . # UI: So this is a introduction of our product . # PM: Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but # PM: keep on speaking . # UI: , so next slide . # UI: So there are several key features of our pr prototype . # UI: The first is that it is fuzzy . # UI: I'm sure this would be the unique design the market . # PM: Maybe , I hope so . # UI: , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design . # UI: the second key feature is that s circle channel selection . # UI: In the traditional key traditional controller use button to select the channel but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel . # UI: So it's quite convenient for user to use it . # PM: but don't touch don't destroy your prototype . # UI: the third feature is a stable triangle base . # UI: this sta this triangle base is very stable , so it's unlikely you cannot found it . # UI: So it's v , you can put it in the table so you can turn the ball to cha to select the channel and there's some cute button . # UI: You c can you can see the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom , so # PM: Everything's mushroom . # PM: So we can call our remote control the mushroom . # UI: , everything's mushroom . # UI: Mushroom design , . # ID: but it's not like really mushroom because you have you know like lemon shape , you know , centre is yellow and t d # UI: th that's why if you put it in the table , be careful , somebody will eat it . # ID: To integrate , you know . # ID: I don't think I hope nobody will eat it You know , to integrate the fruit aspect , you know the in # ME: , because mushroom was not in the trends . # ME: I mean there was fruits . # PM: Fruits and vegetables . # ID: Fruit and vegetable , # PM: Vegetables . Mushroom is a vegetable . # ID: so mushroom was a kind of you know # ME: I don't think it is . # PM: It's vegetable . # ID: Oh , I'm not sure . # PM: So th it's something eatable . # ID: it's a veg a kind of vegetable , but you know we integrated them with different colour . # ME: But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway , so it's fine . # ID: I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know . # ID: This , you know , very enlighted colours , you know . # ME: Inspira inspiration is # ID: And inspired colour and very sophisticated material , so . # UI: , no this our only two slides . # ID: So what we w what I can add is that , you know he talk about what is outside , so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , you know , the chip , it is a low level chip , and # UI: So we cut it to see . # ID: You know , we don't need to k . # ID: You know wi the low level chips inside and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i # UI: So where's the battery ? # ID: The battery it is under . # ID: It is in th in the base , . # PM: In the basement . In the basement . # PM: And where is the solar cell ? # ME: But we say we sa we said solar . # PM: Where is the solar cell ? # ID: In fact this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and # PM: Do you think it won't be It won't cris increase the price ? # ID: I don't think so , # PM: Okay , we'll see after . # ID: but it it's might be okay , so . # PM: We will have first to # ID: I it might be okay . So # PM: so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ? # ME: I mean , we gonna try to measure how good it is instead of just talking about we had three keys key points to for this remote control design , and first one was fancy look and feel . # ME: So w we'll try to judge this feature with a one to seven scale , one being no , I think . # ME: just let me check . # ID: So , four point three point five , it means it's acceptable . # ME: One one being true , and seven being false . # ME: Do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ? # ID: I think you have nice colours . # ID: The sha the bowl shape people like . # UI: , the shape is unique , and the colour # ME: I'll agree it's unique , but is it really # ID: Is it really fancy ? # UI: So it depend on how d do you define fancy . # ME: I mean , fancy was defined by s fruit and vegetable look . # ID: But it's you have the lemon aspect of this th this thing . # PM: Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out , and maybe do things like that # ID: Do Don't do that , please . # ME: I dunno where the lemon is , but # ID: I it's i this shape is a lemon like , so # ME: I mean it's not obvious . # PM: It would be bet more like a lemon ? # ME: I dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or # PM: Looks like more fruit . # PM: Maybe a pineapple ? # ID: , but you don't have any button now . # PM: And you know , you have the finger here , with the buttons ? # ID: That's , is that that's a good idea . # PM: It looks more like a pineapple . # ID: So that's great . # PM: What's the use for that ? # ID: I have no idea , so . # UI: , for turn the ball . # UI: If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to turn the ball to change the channel . # ID: I have no idea what # PM: And where is the voice recognition ? # UI: , it's embedded , your microphone . # UI: Th this th there's two functions . # ME: Wait th that's the second point . # UI: This is microphone array # ME: First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel . # ID: If it is fancy or not . # PM: Is it better like that ? # ID: So we can we can say t # PM: let's say it's a pineapple now . # ID: The colour , is the colour acceptable ? # ME: No , the colour is okay , that's fine . # ID: So the shape now . # PM: It looks like a # ME: but I would say there is more too much red . # PM: now you took it . # ID: It's too much red ? # ID: In the basement ? # PM: It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top . # ME: Right . So , from one to seven ? # ID: I will give I will # PM: Seven is the ma the maximum ? # ME: No , seven is false and one is true . # ID: I'll give two or three . # PM: Three , I will say three . # ID: Three , it's okay . # ID: Three is fine for me . # PM: Isn't it bitter like that ? # ME: The other criterion is it technologically in innovative . # ID: Is it easy to use ? # PM: You said previously that you there's microphone inside an # UI: , this is microphone array , in fact . # ID: It's a micro array , okay . # UI: There four microphone . # UI: So they there's a microphone array . # PM: and you have the there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ? # PM: And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ? # UI: So you can capture voice , you c , so you can capture s voice from different directions . # ID: And I think you you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is # ME: bu but when you say technologically it's more I dunno , in the core , or single . # PM: We have tactile buttons . # ID: I see , you have microphone array embedded . # ME: No , that's good . # ME: , th that's another really good point . # ID: I think technically it's acceptable , so # ME: So using the same scale , two ? # PM: I would say two # ID: Two , two . It's it's fine , so . # PM: It's better like that , isn't it ? # ME: Now maybe the most critical one . # ME: L last one w I would like to judge is it easy to use ? # ID: Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy . # ID: But it's just speaking . # UI: , it's very easy . # ID: You just need the command . # UI: You can use this in this way . # ME: but this turning can you can you just re explain me the # ID: As a principle . # UI: Th this is the base . # UI: So you can turn to change the channel . # ME: but how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ? # UI: You just tu turn d # ID: I think maybe if you he # PM: Oh , ok I understand . # ME: Like if you want to go from # PM: You take the remote , so # ID: If you hear some click # PM: and you can turn like that to change the channel ? # ME: but imagine you y # PM: I think it's quite easy to so s zapping , but maybe it will be too fast . # ME: I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's the best way to if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ? # ID: Oh , that's difficult . That's dif that's difficult . # ME: How can you go directly to twenty , for example ? # UI: I if y if it depend on the angle you turn the # ME: I agree . I agree . # ID: but y how you need to know I # ME: But I mean if you're fro from two ? # UI: I if this is a channel one . So it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five . # ID: I think something that # PM: , you have a , like that , and so on . # ME: ju just imagine you have fifty channels # UI: Y fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree . # ME: We're not talking # UI: So you got how many degree you it # PM: but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go # ID: I think you can if you have a scale , so # UI: No no , you don't have to y no it's when you when you stop t when you stop , the turn , then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you # ME: How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ? # UI: It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the # ME: So you count one degree , two degrees , no . # ME: I don't think so . # ID: , it's a bit difficult . # UI: I think so I think so you can do it . # UI: I think so , you can just change . # ID: I think b but the vocal command is easy too . # ID: You can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so # ME: voc vocal command is okay . # ME: But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main # UI: There's also a number , you know . # PM: , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , so you're passing through all the channels . # PM: So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel . # PM: But if you really want to do zapping you don't really know what you want to do , you can turn it . # ME: And this would be more for browsing , . # PM: Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ? # PM: Seems to be good . # PM: Good choice , mister David Jordan . # ME: , I mean you're famous . You . # UI: And also you can , if you i # PM: , what's this cherry ? # UI: You ca you can turn this . # UI: Or you ca you can you can also turn this . # ID: It is a turn off t turn off button , maybe . # UI: For this you can tune it's for tune . # UI: You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two , you skip this . # UI: If you want to from skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this . # UI: It's like fine , from coarse to fine . # UI: This is coarse , this is fine . # UI: So it's coarse to fine design . # ID: that's very technologic , so . # ME: Okay the th this looks better . # UI: this is , from one channel to maybe to ten channel . # ID: S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates # UI: This is from one channel to # ID: maybe one of the # PM: , th you have the vocal commands . # ME: , but it has to be on to recognise fas # PM: Most of the time you have the it's a sleeping remote control . # ME: , that's not the ecological part , . # PM: W that why we have the solar ti . # ID: To compensate . # ME: So , which number ? # ID: Easy to use , it's very relative but three it's fine , I think , it's reasonable three . # ME: So reasonably , is four , is one ? # ID: Three f three for me , it's o it's okay . # ID: Four or three . # ID: Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean . # PM: And what's your opinion ? # ID: Will you give four ? # ME: we wouldn't say , I mean , those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me . # UI: w what do y what you compare with traditional tr traditional controller ? # UI: I think it's easier than traditional controller . # UI: If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , you have you just turn the turn the ball . # ID: but y you know # UI: There's two kind of balls , # UI: the smaller the so you can c you can c you can control the scale . # UI: But in the traditional controller , how do how can you control the scale ? # ME: by pushing zero after the first one . # ID: You just push two button , zero and one . # UI: , y you can do it , but you can also do it in the b if you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here . # ID: Are there some buttons ? Okay . # UI: , this function is just for your browsing , from one channel to th the next one , the next s sn s , the th the third one . # PM: It's not what you said previously . # PM: Previously you said that turning this was the fine # ME: , if you're changing your mind . # ME: Fine to coarse . # PM: Fine to coarse . # PM: And from ten to ten channels here . # UI: Y one to ten , ten to twelve , ten to t twenty . Ten to twenty and this one , t one two three four five six , like this . # UI: there's different scale , so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc # ME: But this has to stay on the table , right ? # ME: This has to stay on the table . # ID: In fact on a flat place # UI: I i this is just a base . # ME: but then when you turn it # PM: , no , no . You can't put it out . # ID: Oh ye yes , that's right . # PM: It's just your turning from the base . # PM: You need to have everything in hand . # PM: If you want to turn , you can't use it and turn . # PM: It's impossible . # PM: You need to put it on and turn . # ME: You know tha that's the weak point , # UI: You use your y # ME: because with a traditional one you just have one hand . # PM: , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control . # UI: So th this is a d next generation controller . # PM: Nobody would take it . # ME: , you would never you would never lose this one , . # PM: So nobody w will lost lose it . # ID: maybe , maybe may it's the next prototype , maybe we cou # UI: Okay okay , okay . # PM: S maybe we can change from th # ID: Four . Maybe four , it's okay . # PM: Easy to use , four . # PM: Gonna say four . # ID: , four it's more reasonable . # ME: it's even easier to maybe . # ID: You can you can erase with this er . # ID: , four it's more reasonable , so . # ID: nine over three . # ID: It need maybe some wo further work , but it's # ME: , especially on the easy to use target . # ID: Might it might be fine . # PM: So , th the project is accepted ? # PM: But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple . # PM: If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control . # ID: That's the finance . # PM: Okay and we had a project prototype presentation with the evaluation . # PM: So as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we'll have look to the final sh financial view . # PM: we need to calculate the production cost . # PM: As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros . # PM: And if not if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it . # PM: So , just have a look at the okay here is the Excel sheet , so it has the energy source . # PM: We have hand dynamo . # PM: No , we don't use that . # PM: We have battery , right ? # ID: , we have battery . # PM: Kinetic , we don't have it , I suppose , but we have solar cells . # PM: , how many do y do you need , solar cells ? # PM: Do you think one would be enough , or such as number of branches ? # ID: I think in each ball you have three Three three solar cells . # PM: Single simple chip on print ? # PM: Just one would be necessary ? # ID: S s simple , simple , . # PM: Zero for the others . # PM: And sample sensor , sample speaker . # PM: As we have voice recognition , I think . # ME: So we are all already nineteen . # PM: just keep on going , just to have an idea . # UI: The solar cell is too expensive . # ID: Is Yes a wooden pl I and that's There's no wood , so plastic just only , I think . # PM: , but what about case ? # PM: Uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved . # PM: I think it's more like double curved . # ME: That's gonna be double curved , . # ID: Double curve , double curve . # ID: But it's , a rubber # ME: Rather four buttons . # PM: do we need special colour ? # ME: Oh no , interface . # PM: We have two special colours . # ME: , that's special colours , sure . # UI: Mm . , we have four . # PM: Scroll wheel . # PM: It it's more like integrated scor . # ID: I think that this will be like a scroll wheel , actually . # ME: tha that's wheel . # ID: Y you tu you turn you turn it , so # PM: , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse to fine scroll wheel . # PM: So , no button supplements ? # ME: I think the price is okay . # PM: Okay we I think we have problem . # ID: L_C_ display , maybe . Interface . # PM: I think we s if we keep on adding things # ID: It's okay . fine . # ME: w one of the m key point is solar cells . # PM: Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ? # PM: Has it changed . # ID: , it was stage one , so . # ME: No y i it did change , but # UI: We have change the electronics to from the sample sensor to regular chip . Oh . # ME: just imagine we have # UI: We have to delete the sample sensor , I think . # PM: but we have you the voice recognition , # ME: but this one of the feature we were not really # UI: it's the one it's m maybe we ha we have two versions , the first version , the basic version . # ID: I think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe . # UI: Advanced version we have speak . # ID: Because it seems that this can be # PM: Or it would be better . # ID: , wood into plastic and it should be fine . # UI: Plastic is free . # PM: So , do we need special colour ? # ME: , that's one of the requirement . # PM: Because we have red . # ID: , red and yellow . # PM: Red and yellow . # UI: We we can we can we c # ME: We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black . # ME: Black then is a regular colour , so . # PM: I think so we need if we try to have a kind of pineapple bee . # ME: So push button then it's the next expensive one . # PM: An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button . # PM: And I think this is one . # PM: Integrated scroll wheel push button # ME: , thi this might be . # PM: . So we'll we have only one ? # PM: And push button . # PM: So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button , it's # ID: I can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons , so we can just , I dunno , try to modify some of them to have . # ME: Okay , so what's the bottleneck ? # UI: How about we change the sale ? # ME: Double curved . # ID: Double curve . We can transform the double curve into single c . # PM: Something flat . # PM: S uncurved . , maybe not . # ID: Single curve . # ME: Case , what's the ca # ID: Single curve should be fine , so . # ME: And then one Euro left . # PM: Maybe don't bat no battery , only solar cells . # ID: It's it's a bad idea , so . # PM: I think there's a problem with the push button . # PM: We only need maybe just one . # ID: That's fine . That's fine . # UI: Okay . Okay . Agree . # PM: So , you will have # ME: So we have one button , # ID: One s one scroll wheel , so # PM: So one button , and s scroll wheel with push button on it . # ID: And the vocal chord , it's fine . # ID: It I th it's fine . # ME: It's good they're not charging anything for that . # PM: So , . It think we we've done good job , as the cost is # UI: Cou could we have look # PM: twelve fifty e # UI: Could we have look at the p the prod the p the cost ? # ME: y actually it's wrong . We're not under twelve Euros and a half . # PM: , but it's under or equal . # PM: It's not written . # PM: Sometimes it's under or equal . # ID: It's under or equal . It's fine , so # PM: Twelve fifty . # ID: It's fine , twelve fifty # UI: Which part is the most expensive part ? # ID: The solar cells , r is i is it ? # UI: , I think it's not t # PM: But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be # ID: , to be able to si to sell it . # ME: That's nice argument , # ME: but if it's still four our of twelve . # ID: It's it is really very expensive , though . # ID: Maybe if okay . # PM: but it will be technologically innova innovative , so . # ME: but we just have one button . # PM: So it's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button . # ME: I don't know about powerful . # PM: Easy , powerful . # ID: It's easy to use . It's very easy to use . # PM: So I don't think we need to redesign the p the product . # ME: that's what we've just done . # ID: We've done it with it is under the if it was low , high or so . # ID: So what are we going to do with this project evaluation ? # ME: Well I think we have just have to discuss if # ID: Okay , okay , it's fine . # PM: So did you enjoy your clay modelling ? # UI: Yes . Of course . This is my job . # PM: Was it a nice way to create your remote control ? # UI: it's good , to create a control instead of a computer . # ID: , I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end . # ID: And designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and it was very informative for . # PM: And for the marketing guy ? # ME: tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe . # ME: 'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it . # PM: And new ideas about new products , maybe , wi which would be fashion and yellow . # ID: I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after a fruit T_V_ or I dunno . # ID: It can be an interesting I don't know # PM: Yes , just lemon . # ID: , just a lemon T_V_ it'd be yellow lemon . # UI: , but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's # UI: the shape is very boring . # ID: , that's right . It's really boring , . # UI: Could we come up with new T_V_ with such as this kind of T_V_ ? # UI: So you can you have base , triangle base so you the T_V_ you can # PM: , the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control . # ID: , that's that would be really interesting , actually . # UI: . Because the T_V_ you also # PM: Oh , that's interesting . # PM: You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . Electronic device . # ME: , but just don't trust too much the trends . # ME: 'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years . # PM: , maybe la next year it will be insects . # ME: Maybe two years it's dead . # ID: But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product . # ME: , but this is good because it's not a long life product . # ME: T_V_ is more like fifteen years , maybe , so . # ME: If you have a lemon T_V_ for # ID: We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know . # ME: fifteen years # PM: Customable T_V_ . # ID: , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y you can keep # PM: You've already said mobile phones . # ME: Tha that would that would make it . # ID: , you can keep the global appearan # PM: , and following # ID: The mood of persons , the fashions # PM: It's interesting , maybe we can create a line of T_V_ with a tr # ID: A T_V_ for autumn and a T_V_ for winter , you know , so it's So what i and do w is it Okay . # PM: So I think the costs are within the budget . # PM: We're just at twelve fifty Euros . # PM: do you think you can celebrate your creation ? # UI: And you can celebrate your leadership . # PM: Oh , thanks a lot . # PM: Thank you , mister David Jordan . # ID: but I think f it's really a celebrating object . # ID: So it's yellow and very a very ha it's very happy , so . # ID: it's a pr it's like . # ME: It's party remote control . # PM: The thing now is to sell it . # ID: right , go and sell it . # ID: Goo and good luck , so # UI: Okay and the twelve fifty twelve # ME: Twenty five Euros . # UI: Twenty five Euros , . # ID: It should be fine . # PM: It's maybe a little bit expensive . # UI: Twenty five Euros . # UI: No , it's not so expensive . # ME: I'm not so happy about the fruit shape , you know . # ID: It should be it should be fine , you know , actually . S # PM: Maybe what you can do a test . Put it outside , and if bees come , it's really fruit . # ID: I think I like the colour a the colour are very good , so actually so # PM: But don't put sugar in it , it's not working . # ME: No , the colours are it's perfect , . # ID: It's perfect , and # ME: , another thing is the logo is missing still . # PM: but the colour , I think the colour is more is most important , # ID: the yellow ball thing that # PM: because I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control . # ME: Still that was one of the requirements we had . # ME: It's but it I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere . # ID: f like y we can we can put some double R_ # PM: , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs . # PM: So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ . # ID: Okay , . That's actually good idea , so # PM: So we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , # UI: So we have to give a # PM: so we have the slogan too . # UI: So we have give him give it a cute name . # PM: th no , it's the it's the pineapple control remote control . # UI: Mush mushroom controller . # ME: Cute na You cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend . # PM: It's a pineapple now , it has changed . It's a pineapple . # ID: It's not a mushroom . # ID: It's a pineapple remote controls . # ME: It's not the trend . # ID: , pineapple remote control . # ME: , but just flying saucer , or # PM: With cherry on top . # ME: I would say flying saucer . # ID: Oh unid unidentified remote control , so # ME: It's more appropriate , somehow . # ID: That's that's pineapple remote control . I think it's fine . # PM: Will you buy one ? # ID: . I will try I'll try # UI: Twenty five Euro . # ID: . I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy to manage # UI: you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your T_V_ # ID: I always lose my , so i if it is a universal one I can use it with my T_V_ , so it would be # UI: so you need to buy one . # PM: One thing I like is the shape , because you know it's not like the remote controls you can put in your pocket , on in your jacket . # UI: Traditional one ? # UI: So this one and this one . What do you choose ? # PM: I prefer the laser remote control . No . # ID: I think I would choose this one because of the colour . It's # UI: What do you choose ? # ID: it's will enlight your house , your home and your T_V_ , so . # PM: Oh . Maybe next if we decide to do something we'd can put light inside . # ID: , that would be an idea . # ME: but that's going to be expensive , you know . # ME: We had some problems going to twelve Euros and I dunno . # PM: I think it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after . # ME: , afterwards , if it's a new trend . # ID: that's that fine . # ID: So we can celebrate now . # ID: That's our new product . # PM: Champagne , mister Baba . # ME: We should celebrate . # ID: It's it's fine . It's I like it . # ID: Well , I'll buy one here . # PM: Okay , I will close this . Mm . # PM: So I think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control and we have a nearly final product . # ME: Our final prototype which . # ID: Final prototype , ye . # PM: Final prototype , right . # PM: thank you very much . # PM: Very productive . # ID: S so who is going to take the remote control ? .
# PM: Good morning everybody . # ID: Good morning . # PM: Oh , everybody is not ready . # PM: So , we're here today to have our first kick-off meeting about this new project we're going to tak to talk about in a few minutes . # PM: so I will be Sebastian the Project Manager . # UI: I'm Michael . I'm the user interface designer . # ME: Hi I'm Guillermo . I'm the Marketing Expert . # ID: And I am Hemant , the industrial designer . # PM: Okay , very good . # PM: Thanks for being here . # PM: so let's have a look to the agenda . # PM: So , we are going to go through this agenda and mainly first to make to be used to the tools available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here . # PM: then we'll go to the plans for project and have general discussions about it . # PM: So , the goal of this project is to developed a new remote control . # PM: it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly . # PM: As usual we will follow the project method that we are using in the in our company . # PM: It is in three step as you know . # PM: First the functional design . # PM: The second's a conceptual design , and then the detailed design . # PM: During each step of each design we wi you will work s separately , individually on your specific tasks and will m we will meet to discuss and take decisions about what you've you did and what we will do next . # PM: So first , we have to train ourself with all the tools availables in the in this nice meeting room and particularly the white board so we are going to go through the white board and take some s some notes or do some drawings . # PM: So who want to start ? # UI: well if no one else wants to , . # UI: Okay so , want me to draw my favourite animal . # UI: Well , I don't really have a favourite animal , but # PM: You have one in mind ? # UI: I think I have one in mind , so I'm gonna about the spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board . # UI: The spider has a spider lives in a web and it has eight legs , and it can move all about the web in two dimensions . # UI: Unless it's a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes . # UI: There are some spiders that live in like that have like kind of a big ball of a of a web . # UI: And the other thing is some spiders can actually fly like they have they let out like a stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new build a new web somewhere else . # UI: So I think they did this in Charlotte's Web that movie that little well it's actually a book first but at the end all the spiders kinda flew away . # UI: So , that's my animal . # PM: Very interesting . # PM: Guillermo you want to ? # ME: I dunno why , but when I was a child I wanted to be a panther not a pink panther , # ID: But don't you think it's very difficult to draw a panther ? # PM: It would be very funny for us . # ID: So bad I don't like it . # ME: Okay it's a friendly panther . # UI: Maybe it's happy 'cause it just ate someone . # ME: Actually , honestly I dunno what's his it's be behaviour , I dunno if it's the male who hunts or it's the female , I have watched that lions di didn't hunt it's the female lions who hunt , I like it because it's fast , and it's black as well , so it can he it can hide itself very easily and it's it looks like powerful , strong , I dunno . # ME: I watch a film about a black panther when I was a child and I was in that age when everything was shocking me a lot . # PM: Okay . Thank you . # UI: So you don't like pink panthers ? # ID: This lapel is coming out once in a while . # ID: It's not very strong . # ID: So , not the favourite animal , but I think I'll draw elephant . # ID: I'll try to draw elephant . # ID: It's a problem . # ID: Okay so , elephant goes like this , and then it has four feet . # ID: I don't know whether there's any dist there should be any distance or not , but I think this is the easiest . # ID: And then we have it's trunk . # ID: yep something like this . # PM: Poor elephant . # ID: and sometimes they have a hump . # ID: It seems that elephants are pretty friendly and they have one very important way a different way of walking . # ID: So when they walk , wherever they are going to put their first feet , the second feet will always be . # ID: When they'll come to that position the second , the third feet will be there . # ID: That's the way they walk . # ID: And that's very peculiar about them . # ID: None of the other animals walk like this . # ID: And they are very useful to human beings . # ID: At least few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something , or when they had to carry huge loads from one place to another , elephants were very useful . # ID: And they are found in usually the warm countries . # ID: And they are the biggest terrestrial animal . # ID: That's what I know about them . # ID: So , that's what I wanted to tell about elephants . # UI: So is this an Indian or an African elephant , 'cause you haven't drawn the ears ? # ID: There are two kind of , they are very different , Indian and African elephants . # ID: So Indian elephant is having one bump , I think , and the African have two . # ID: And then there's a difference in the trunk of the animals , these elephants who are Indian and So at some for some elephants it's the trunk is having one Do we have some message there ? # PM: We have to I have to catch you , # PM: We have to go through the meeting . # ID: ? Okay , some other time . # UI: We can discuss that off-line . # PM: we'll discuss a f a fly or do we'll do another meeting abo on elephants . # PM: so another important part of the project is about money , and about so about finances . # PM: So we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control and we have which would generate a profit of fifty million Euros , okay . # PM: And we should target the inter an international market . # UI: So could I just ask one question , is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling ? # UI: So it's gonna be you already have a T_V_ but you're buying an extra remote control for it or something ? # PM: O this is the next topic we have to discuss exactly , # UI: Okay , alright . # PM: so let's go to it . # PM: So we should decide which kind of remote control we want to we want to we want to go . # PM: Should be should it be specific remote control to some specific device ? # PM: Should it be a universal one ? # PM: And etcetera . # PM: So so I'm waiting for your for your inputs very quickly because we have only three minutes to go . # UI: Okay well , so , it seems the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make , which seems to a kind of a little strange if we don't know what the product is yet , but I guess if that's if that's the requirement that we need to design the product to actually fit that price bracket so , I guess we're gonna need to find out what's actually you know , what people ar are willing to pay for what kind of product they're expecting for twenty-five Euro because it seems quite a lot for a remote control , # PM: Okay I think this is more a job to our market person . # ID: Marketing person . # PM: So it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to have an overview of this and in which direction we should go . # PM: So we need to close the meeting . # PM: we'll have a new meeting soon and so the work every of you ha have t d to do . # PM: So you have to work on the on the working design , you have to work on the technical functions , and you have to work on us user requirements specs , alright ? # PM: you will receive some information by emails , i as usual . # PM: Thanks for coming today .
# PM: Okay everybody is ready ? # PM: Good morning again . # PM: So , today we are going to have a f second meeting . # PM: Oh Michael , hi . # PM: You have a good reason for that ? # PM: Okay , let's have a look to the agenda today . # PM: So , we are going to have a meeting about the functional design . # PM: so first before starting I w just going to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting . # PM: So basically we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh remote control , but I have new i inputs for about that topics . # PM: I goin I'm going to share with you . # PM: And basically we decided to go to individual actions for each of you so Industrial Designer should wor was supposed to work on th on th on the working design . # PM: You showed us you ar you prepare something for us ? # PM: The U_I_ guy also work on that , and for the mar our Marketing Expert should deliver some specs . # PM: Alright so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations . # PM: But first I would like quickly to decide of to give a name to the project . # PM: So , I just put d quickly Remo , but if you have any o other names that we co could decide for just to keep something fun for our project we should we could discuss quickly . # UI: the Powerstick . # UI: Maybe a Spanish name would work well . # ME: Mm I was thinking of the # UI: Especially if we're selling into the U_S_ market becasue there's a lot of Spanish speakers there . # UI: Maybe something that sounds cool in English but sounds funny in Spanish . # ME: It doesn't it doesn't sound cool for me , # PM: What does it mean ? # ME: but maybe for a Spanish for I for # UI: What does it mean in Spanish ? # UI: 'Cause it also like in English it sounds like you know the man's tool you know because you know men like to have control of the remote so it might # ME: Mando sounds Latino . # PM: So , let's go for Mando ? # PM: No objection ? # UI: And we could have some like you d you could have the fonts you know special , so you have man in like in one o in one font and then the O_ as like # PM: Okay , I think this is # UI: Although you don't wanna cut women out of the potential buyers though , # ID: they are the most T_V_ watcher . # ID: So we should be careful . # PM: Okay , I think this is more a question of # PM: I think this is more a question of look and feel . # PM: Something that should be addressed later We should we should go to other for the other topics . # ME: because if the product will be international # UI: Well that's the thing . # UI: We need to know who we're selling it to before we can really decide on a # PM: so let's stick f to Man Mando for the name and we'll see for the for the look and feel later . # PM: So let's go for the three presentations right now . # PM: So , who want to start ? # PM: So maybe we could start with the market , . # ME: Maybe maybe I should start . # PM: Okay so I have your slides somewhere ? # ME: Should be in participant four . # PM: Participant four . # PM: S that's coming . # ME: Okay so I will I will give a brief outline about what I what I prepared for this meeting . # ME: For the functional requirements and especially for the for the user requirements . # ME: I prepare a marketing report and we have to find the weaknesses and the improvements we could do to the current remote controls . # ME: And also I di I did a study with for the incorporation of new technologies it seems that the remote controls have been have remained the same for the last five , ten years . # ME: There is no significant difference between the b the first new controls and # PM: Sh next slide ? # ME: Well more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly . # ME: So and they admit that the they should s they would spend more money in a fancier remote control , which is which is good and it's interesting point . # ME: Also the people are worried about the R*_S_I_ disease , which is if you repeat the sa the same movement , which is not a with a not very appropriate device , you will have problems whe when you will get old . # ME: So s people are worried about the shape of the of the remote control . # ME: They are also they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often , so I think it would be a good point to l to find a solution to any beep any alarm or something incorporated to with the remote control every time it get lost . # ME: And also I found that young people the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control . # ME: So in my opinion the Mando this Mando shouldn't be very small because the smaller it is , the more like the liklier it is to get lost . # ME: Liklier or more likely ? # ME: people also complain because they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who w which are not very use like f memorising channels or this kind of actions which are not very often but they shouldn't they shouldn't have the same importance in the in the in the remote cont in the remote control . # ME: Also the z the design should fit the hand shape . # ME: So it may be interesting to think in a in both prototypes , for right and left handed people . # UI: Well th the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person . # UI: So unless you're kind of targeting single people you know you're gonna maybe cut out some a lot of your market . # ME: I dunno I th Anyway I think it could be int interesting to release some a small fraction of this remote controls . # ID: Well maybe it could be a universal design . # ID: A universal design , which is which is good for both the hands . # UI: Still shaped for your hand but not for a particular hand , right ? # ID: That's right , whether it's left hand or right hand , but don't you think that the two points are clashing , one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small ? # ID: The first and the third point , they are clashing . # UI: Well it can still be a , you can still extend past the hand . # ID: So fitting the hand doesn't mean much then . # UI: Well it means like , this remote here is kind of is very thin and long so instead of having you know you might have it kind of a bit bigger or , you know , with maybe some finger molds or something . # ID: So it means design should be similar to the traditional ones ? # ID: Little sleek , longer ? # ID: And it should fit the hand . # ME: I was thinking of so like something # PM: Something with the shape of the palm ? # UI: Some finger grips maybe . # UI: You could even have some buttons like you know on the sides and everything , # ME: It sh it shouldn't it shouldn't be symmetric symmetrical . # PM: And then finally # ME: And finally , the incorporation of a L_C_D_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting , but I don't know if the budget would be large enough . # PM: First I'm just wondering about the L_C_D_ stuff because # ME: But most of most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology . # PM: , so maybe it's a good time for me to bring you to some new informations . # PM: We had the new requirements from the so from the head offices of the company , and so they wanted so they want to they would like to be restricted to T_V_ . # PM: Okay , I dunno if you had this information already . # PM: so they want us to restrict the remote control to T_V_ only because of time limitations . # PM: they want also # ME: Actually this marketing report is restricted to T_V_ remote controls . # PM: So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well te teletext is outdated now and finally , it should be clear that the corporate image , that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product . # UI: I was still I was still working on this twenty five Euro price point because I think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there , this is quite a low price if we're maybe I can get to this in my presentation though , # PM: So maybe we can jump to your presentations , right now . # PM: Okay so let's keep in mind about tha that this last point about L_C_D_ and speech reco # UI: I think even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you think if you're watching T_V_ you're gonna have a lot of this background noise from the T_V_ which might interfere with the # UI: participant three . # UI: You might have some background noise from the T_V_ which will make the speech recognition much harder , so . # ME: but you should be able to activate or disactivate , so yeah . # UI: Oh you press a press a button to talk , and the T_V_ the T_V_ sound turns off . # ME: channel fifty . # ID: it could be command control kind of thing . # ID: It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated . # ID: Means you say you should say like does that , remote control being on or be on kind of thing , and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition . # ID: Because this kind of thing means speech is there from the T_V_ also . # ID: So there should be something command controlled , you start and then you stop . # ID: It's like V_I_ editor , you are having two modes similarly . # ID: Otherwise it's just lying idle . # PM: Okay Michael . # UI: Okay , so , could I describe the mouse maybe be easier to could I use the mouse , or Mm . Thanks . # PM: The wheel doesn't work . # UI: Okay so while researching this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote , and just looked to see if they're actually available in any current remotes , and then also searched for which are the top-rated remote controls on Epinions dot com , which is a you know a customer written basically review site . # UI: So there's a pretty wide range of remote controls these days and this remote control on the right here is one of the more extravagant , but it's not really it's by no means mm you know on it's own in being so expensive . # UI: There are a lot of expensive remote controls out there . # PM: Looks like a P_D_A_ ? # UI: well basically all the functions are controlled through the L_C_D_ screen except for the really kind of main functions , which have a couple of their own buttons . # UI: and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out on the market , I know we're working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have these L_C_D_ screens which kind of helps when you're using multiple devices I suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions d different functions on the screen at different times . # UI: But the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control , and it's kind of difficult to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it , which is kind of like a mouse scroll wheel , which I think is it's a really kind of important design aspect 'Cause the thing is what a what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do . # UI: And obviously the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel . # ID: Change the channels . # UI: I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of changing the channel . # UI: 'Cause I know when I when I use the remote to change the channel I very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad . # UI: I usually use the up and down # UI: because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a two-digit number , and then two numbers , so that's just it's annoying . # UI: So I think a scroll wheel is quite handy . # UI: the scroll wheel is much more useful if you have an L_C_D_ screen , and this brings us to the point you were mentioning before about the internet capability . # UI: One possibility , if we now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu Euro , but one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen so that instead of actually saying I want to I want to go to channel thirty seven because I know this programme's on , you know , often you don't know what ch what channel it's on , or you don't know what's on . # UI: If you have a list of programs on your L_C_D_ screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel . # UI: So if you think about it's kind of like a you know in mobile phones now you don't use you don't remember people's phone number , you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it . # UI: So this would be pretty kind of a handy thing to have , but we really need t to discuss the price . # UI: So , I mean there are there are cheaper this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's very simple , there's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context . # UI: So this is something else we might wanna consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons , because this is the top rating universal remote control on Epinions . # UI: It it's really maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as possible because really I think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control . # UI: And was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used tasks , but I think also you know the location and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons . # UI: So if you have too many buttons it increases the difficulty of finding the one you want . # ID: But there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality . # ID: Because the same button is doing too many things . # UI: well we will have a bit of a simpler task in that we're only doing a television remote control . # UI: I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open door that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . # UI: I would if I had my perfect remote control , I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way . # UI: They don't really do anything . # UI: Maybe you know I although I do also find flip-open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or whatever , but maybe a door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good . # UI: but I think definitely you need to keep the buttons down to a minimum , but not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of the device . # ME: H I think I think that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control shouldn't be very abrupt very hard because w if people see a remo see the see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional # ID: It does sampling out of the . # UI: Well I guess that depends on how you market it . # UI: if you have the right advertisement showing how easy it is and how you can , you know , navigate to a program without the numbers , then people might say that looks pretty easy . # PM: Okay , can you continue , please Mi ? # UI: okay , so , I think one of the really kind of useful things you can do with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number . # UI: So if we can have a higher priced remote control I think that would really be worth something that would be worth implementing . # UI: mm there's the L_C_D_ screen , which maybe is too expensive , but I think also at the scroll wheel , I haven't mentioned it here , the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily . # UI: I think even that , I mean , that would be a fairly cheap thing , compared to an L_C_D_ screen , to implement , but I think that would be quite useful as well . # UI: And the other thing , you say we need to we need to keep it just television , but I think one maybe one option , since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device , is you know there's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of you can have with technology , and maybe we wanna make it something that's extensible to do other tasks . # UI: Say you have like a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can , say , change the lighting in the room . # UI: You know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra , so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development , but , you know , later on you could you can you know you also , selling the potential of the device . # UI: Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , I dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on , and , I think that's something we may need to have as at least as an optional extra to kinda make our product cool , since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics . # PM: you want to go ? # ID: So most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition , that means on my own I # PM: No , not that one . # ID: Okay so the working design is user i interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology . # ID: So he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this , and on top of that there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote . # ID: So the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes , it can it can be useful for them , and the new users , as our Marketing Expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing . # PM: sorry to interrupt you , but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel . # ID: So anyway , that didn't come into my mind , so th that is a possibility . # ID: These could be other kind of interfaces . # ID: Means we can have , depending on the cost , how much we can afford , we can have different kind of interfaces . # ID: So spe buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with . # ID: So if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is , and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty-five Euros money which we are thinking . # ID: Otherwise we are just like others in the market . # ID: So anyway that is the first , user interface could be of more than one type , and that means we can do the on-line changes which cannot be done now actually . # ID: So apart from the speech , we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons . # ID: Now for buttons , normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required . # ID: And for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote . # PM: That increases the cost also . # ID: But means we have to see how much what kind of microphones and stuff like that . # PM: Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to target well of such technologies is enough ? # ID: yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough . # ID: we can target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc # PM: Well wh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance a an ambience microphones because you are not going to speak into th into the remote control . # ID: No it could be little d it could be # PM: So it could be s a few centimetres . # UI: Well one other thing that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is when you want to sell into other markets , though , # ID: That's right . That's right . # UI: because , I'm not sure exactly where we're gonna sell this , but I presume it's not gonna just be English speaking countries . # UI: So then you have to s you know , you have to train models for # ID: it's more like , means there are different speech technologies which are existing so D_T_W_ could be kind of which is the easiest . # ID: So you have to store some templates on the on the on the chip itself , and it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is , instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro-controller . # PM: Okay we shou we should discuss this la later after this slide . # PM: This is a this is a this is a very important issue in discussion . # ID: So we can That's right . Yep . # PM: that finished ? # ID: So , will you go to the next slide ? # ID: so this is the design which we are thinking so . # ID: We are having a power button and the switch , which is not much , and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not . # ID: And then there are two kind of things which can be so one is the button interface which has not been shown because of lack of time . # ID: So we could not put that . # ID: So now where the A_S_R_ decoder is sitting , similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there . # ID: So there is A_S_R_ decoder which could be there , and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller , and then there could be buttons , and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format . # ID: And then there is there is the chip which is sitting , the green one , and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver . # ID: So this is the easiest design the there could be . # ID: So th an A_S_R_ decoder we can have things in . # ID: To have different technologies . # ID: So this was the my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control . # UI: You know I guess you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying you know turn volume up , and you press the press the button like s people teach sign language to kids f well , by speaking and doing # ID: but as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up . # ID: So these are the slight problems . # PM: So your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies ? # ID: Because the reason is that if we go into the market means though I don't have much idea , but as he the Marketing Expert presentation was # ME: I'm sure if you can sell a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo everyone will s will buy it . # UI: Actually I'm not so sure # ID: So if we go with just the # UI: because I'm the # UI: you know if I was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well , I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm instead of pressing up on a remote control . # UI: You know if there's some there's some dialogue all of a sudden that I can't hear , I'm trying to actually find out what's being said , so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps . # ME: but you know the average frequency of pushing buttons , it's about # UI: Well it depends if it's a remote control th # ME: it's about eighty pushes per hour , or something like that . # UI: Maybe if the remote control is something that y you don't actually have to pick up anymore , that would be a useful feature of the speech recogntion . # UI: If you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it , then that could be . # PM: Okay gentlemens , we have to take some deci decisions right now . # PM: so if I if I kind of summarise everything we've de we said . # PM: We are targeting T_V_ . # PM: We need we need to have um remote control which is fanc fancy , which is which is easy to hand not too small , not too big . # ME: With a good shape for the # PM: or good shape , yes . # PM: We should bring new technologies for young peoples , and as we have also requirements to use to push thr toward the internet . # PM: Maybe this is something we can stick to it . # PM: And also , a very interesting things I I've seen on the one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate . # PM: So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an target price , it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_ and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies . # PM: first m why not to go to L_C_D_ . # PM: Because in fact as we are targeting T_V_ in fact we can use T_V_ screen as a screen to feedback to give some feedback informations about what we could have . # UI: Well it depends though well it depends . # UI: If we don't unless we have some input some video input to the T_V_ or we have control over the T_V_ then we can't actually display that . # UI: Like if we if we produce the T_V_s then we can put you know menus up there , but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of something sitting in between the video signal and the and the T_V_ to superimpose those menus . # UI: So that's an extra # PM: Don don't you ha don't we have contacts with people on T_V_ or well systems that exist that we can use ? # UI: Well this is this is another que we still haven't really defined the remote . # UI: Are we still you say we're focusing on T_V_ , but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of televisions ? # UI: 'Cause that really makes a big difference . # UI: 'Cause even if we have contacts we can't really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other companies' T_V_s . # UI: It's just there are too many T_V_s out there . # UI: It's it's not really gonna # PM: That's good point . # PM: What's what cou what could be the cost of well , could we fit the targets in terms of cost if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control ? # UI: For twenty five Euro ? I think it's impossible . # ID: It's not possible . It's impossible . # UI: But but I dunno , I think it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that any leeway in that twenty five Euro because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control , and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics . # UI: So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of increasing the of increasing the unit price . # PM: So you mean yo you mean we should target something maybe which is which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to in terms to had to have really an added value ? # ME: What would be # PM: so regarding the automatic speech recognition , I think this is # ME: Wha but what would be one question , what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control ? # ME: What what kind of information ? # UI: 'Cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide . # ME: but mo most of the T_V_s nowadays show the show the # PM: They have tele teletext . # PM: Well , because they have teletext on it . # PM: Th th you have a teletext sin signal that you can that you can that you can get thr through the channel . # ME: but most of the T_V_s have teletext nowadays . # PM: They have t most of them have teletext , but we want to get rid well one of our requirements is to move to teletext to the use of internet . # UI: You can get a lot more information on it . # PM: to browse more easily the teletext . For instance through your remote control . # ME: So what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_ ? # UI: So you could have the name of the programme , you could have the start time you know where it's up to . # PM: The ti the start time , all the p all the programmes you could have o # UI: You could have a l even a little image of you know the c you know the m the main actors or something so you can quickly just kind of even without reading # PM: Well I don't know if this information is available from teletext , also . # UI: Well no , but there are the electronic programme guides out there . # UI: They may not have pictures , but maybe they do . # UI: There's dependi it also depends on the country . # PM: Well because for the same reason that we cannot informations on the T_V_ . We c we couldn't grab information which is not there . # UI: but I mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from . # UI: So it may be possible that there are people out there providing that . # PM: so that mean w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control , if you want to browse , in addition to the T_V_ , or it should be a special T_V_ connected to # UI: Well I think if we're gonna I think we would definitely need the internet connection because even with y I don't think you could even get teletext information from the T_V_ onto the remote control , especially if we don't control the T_V_ . # UI: We need to find that out . # PM: We need to close the meeting . # ID: But just a small thing , # PM: Very quickly . # ID: what kind of market we are targeting ? # ID: Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market , or what ? # ID: So the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost of L_C_D_ thing could be as high as the T_V_ itself . # ID: That is very important . # PM: well people go to buy another remote control when they broke n broke their , # UI: If it's a really small T_V_ maybe . # ID: Broke . Okay . Okay . # PM: and they want to go t for universal one , and they take the fanciest they can have . # PM: So this is that we z that we should target . # PM: So the com the committment is the following , we don't go for speech recognition technology . # PM: The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion . # PM: It is up to you to go through this way and to report me back next meeting . # ME: I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the than the L_C_D_ . # ID: It's it's cheaper as compared to the L_C_D_ . # PM: Maybe it's cheaper , but we have no # ME: Because with the L_C_D_ you need more requirements . # ME: You need a internet connection . # ME: You need m more things . # UI: Well the thing is I think I think the type of peop # ME: for the speech recognition you don't need anything . # ME: You just say channel fifty , and that's it . # UI: I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or a you know . # ME: But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars , # ID: Means th twenty five Euros is , that's right . # UI: Well this is what we need to find out . # UI: Can we can we increase the price point of this remote control ? # UI: 'Cause otherwise we need # PM: Okay this is this is an open question for you . # PM: This is up to you to tell us . # PM: But I'm definitely not keen on to # ME: To move to another target ? # PM: no , I'm no I'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies . # PM: I'm not confident enough . # PM: I'm not sure that we'll have a product really that work . # UI: It's kind of hard to guarantee that you're gonna # PM: It's real How to guarantee such performances is really hard . # ME: the expert said ninety five percent . # PM: Well this is still is very bad . # UI: Ninety five percent is not good enough though . # PM: So , this is the end of this discussion . # PM: Next meeting here are the task you have to work on . # PM: so you have to work on the component concept . # PM: you have to work on user interface , and you have to go through a trend watching . # PM: So the question is still open about the L_C_D_ thing . # PM: I hope that next meeting we will we'll take some decision that direction .
# PM: Good afternoon . # PM: Hope you have good lunch . # ID: we had falafel . # UI: , yes , I had something similar but non-vegetarian . # PM: So today is our third meeting . # PM: It will be about the conceptual design . # PM: If I come back to the minutes of the last meetings . We decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about u the use of L_C_D_ screen on the remote control because of costs . # PM: So maybe we cou wi will be able to clarify this question to today . # PM: at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point . # PM: So I hope that your respective pr presentations will help us . # PM: So each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform who starts ? # PM: So marketing . # PM: So you are you saved your y your presentation somewhere ? # PM: So you're four ? # PM: Which is trend watch . # PM: Mr Marketing Experts . # ME: Well I investigate the preference more d I investigate deeper the preference of the users . # ME: so the current investigation th the current trends ? # ME: Well wha what I found can you # ME: What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device . # ME: After they want something new technologic technologically speaking , but the most what they what they find more interesting , more or more important it's a fancy look and feel instead of instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel . # ME: So now more cool aspect , ma more a cooler aspect rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things , a device which is pleasant to watch , to see . # ME: Well in Euro in Paris and Milan the in Paris and in Paris and Milan the current trend of clothes , furniture and all this all this fashion it's fruit and the theme is fruit and vegetables . # ME: And also in the in the U_S_A_ the current the mor the most popular feeling it's a spongy . # ME: Spongy means eponge ? # ME: So maybe we should we should think in this direction , so # UI: What what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy ? # UI: What you mean clothe # ID: Spongy means it it's like sp # ME: Fruit vegetables is the new have you seen the last exposition of clothes in Milan ? # UI: No , I missed that one . # ME: , I didn't miss an I didn't miss and I saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes . # UI: Oh , they're okay so they're not like dressed as a carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on , okay . # ME: No no , not yet , not yet . # UI: So we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of a banana , # ME: So te textu textures , . # ME: Vegetable textures and all this kind . # PM: Drawings of bananas . # ID: But what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote ? # PM: Well so this is in the next slide certainly . # UI: So which fruit are you thinking of ? # ME: I ha I haven't thought of any particular fruit , but the general aspect of the of the remote control may could remind some kind of vegetable , some kind of instead of vegetable , some natur mm natural object or something . # ME: But it depends on the # PM: So maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the L_C_D_ . # UI: Oh , so you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit , or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the # ID: Means buttons are in the shape of fruits , # ME: maybe the shape the shape # ID: buttons are in the frape shape of fruits or something , apple , banana , something like that . # ME: No , not n not too much focus , not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different . # PM: Apple for channel one . # ME: So we shouldn't be at re really attached to the trend # UI: So something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant . # ME: For instance , . # ME: African or as an elephant ? # ID: That we can discuss afterwards . # UI: But okay , I'm not , I'm not really sure if that would really appeal to everyone though , maybe just to fashion gurus , like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner , but I don't know about I dunno how ergonomic a , an orange is . # ME: Well ma maybe we should further specify what target are we focusing . # ME: I think in my opinion we should focus on young people because they are more open to new devi new devices # ME: and also according to the marketing report ninety p ninety five percent of young people was able to buy a n a cooler remote control . # UI: But is it is fruit cool ? # PM: That's a question . # UI: Is fruit cool ? # ME: Is the new trend # UI: Well I guess , you know , Apple has the iPod so , just 'cause they have an apple on their on their product , doesn't mean fruit is cool . # ME: No I think we should think about a shape with it a device with a shape of some # UI: Okay , but it has to be easy to use though and to hold you know , you don't wanna pear or a watermelon . # ME: Don don't you think we can find the shape of a fruit which is handy to use ? # UI: Well , probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of , # PM: Maybe too long . # UI: So , but I mean you also have to you have to also have , fit r all the buttons and you know . # UI: The thing is you have t normally with buttons , they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board so if you're gonna have things like on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult to kind of to build . # ID: I don't th it will be rolling a lot . # ME: but I li I like your idea that we shouldn't have a lot of buttons b buttons so # PM: and you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a L_C_D_ on a banana also . # ME: do you want a an L_C_D_ with twenty five Euros ? # PM: Well , you're the Marketing Expert you should tell us if it is too much or not . # ME: I think Well , according to the to the report people are more interested in a fa fancy look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation , so , I will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the # PM: So you suggest to go f # ME: new inputs and also it's I'm not convinced about this L_C_D_ because you need internet connection , you need more things , it's not just buying a new control re remote , you need buying control remote , buying # PM: S so you're simply # ME: It's not so simple . # PM: you're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons . # ME: For instance , . # ME: for given an example . # PM: So maybe you can go ahead ? # ME: no , it's what I already said . # PM: Okay , I'll give the floor . # PM: So you are User Interface guy . # PM: So you're three ? # PM: And it's this one . # UI: Okay . So I received an email around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit , which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control . # ID: But it's just a speaker right ? # UI: what it is , it's very # ID: It's not a microphone . # UI: It has a has a microphone , has a speaker , it's got a little chip and it allows you t # ID: Actually I'm not reading microphone there , so that's why you can all have conversation , it just to speak to you . # UI: Well , it's a sample sensor sample speaker . # UI: Sample sensor sample speaker . # UI: It means that it can recognize , it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that . # UI: But there's no kind of understanding of the phrase . # UI: So , I mean , you know , I guess you could build that in , you could you could link the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on the remote control . # UI: But basically the thing is , we have this technology available # UI: but the thing is obviously there's still gonna be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the c production of the components , so it but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from you know a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done . # UI: Whilst you know , some people might get annoyed if we if we just dump it , # PM: there's something that I unclear really understanding . # PM: Is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords ? # UI: It's it it's no , well , it's it'll recognize I guess keywords , but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase . # UI: You train it for a certain , for a certain phrase , you say the example they said that they have up and running with their prototype is well they've actually integrated into the into the coffee machine that we're producing is , you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it'll playback good morning , how would you like your coffee ? # PM: And it's just to , it's just to playback something ? # UI: So actually that was a bad example , 'cause it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because it can't really understand the response , so . # PM: So this is not s really to do to do control . # UI: Only , like , only in the sense that it can recognize a set a set target kind of word an # PM: This is just more like a poi pois . # UI: It's designed it's designed as a fun kind of thing , but I guess you could use it as a way to implement # PM: it is a uh easy a fancy thing that you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that will not have any # UI: Completely pointless . # PM: comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view . # UI: , unless you know , you like having conversation with your remote control . # ME: but the can we use it for saying okay , channel fifty , channel twenty ? # UI: Well , that's the thing , you can but you have to pro though I think it's a fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination , you have to s tr train it to l to learn channel fifteen , that whole thing , not just the word channel and the word fifteen , it doesn't have that kind of logic in it . # PM: So this is so this is this is much more than tak taking this technology , bringing it to the remote control and using it . # UI: , that would be some development work . # PM: So this is out of discussion . # PM: So if it is something that you can we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control # UI: Banana-mando . # PM: No this is mm banana-bando , . # ME: Banana-mando . # PM: then it could be cool . # ID: let's go ahead . # UI: I don't think it's worth it though , I think it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine , so So if we can just move on to the next slide , I've just done a quick mock-up of uh some of the features of our potential funky-looking remote control # PM: It doesn't look like a banana at all . # UI: Well , you see , I was I was unaware at this point of th of the fruit focus , so at the moment it's more of a box focus . # PM: But you can fit i you're saying now you can fit it to # ME: Looks like a tr look likes a tro a tropical fruit . # UI: , well , this is actu this could be a genetically engineered fruit that's designed to be you know square so that it packs tighter in the boxes . # UI: But , I've just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels , 'cause I think the scroll wheel is a fairly key part of , you know , # ID: Stable thing , that's right . To have , # UI: I think everyone has agreed that it's that it could be quite a useful thing , so . # UI: But I think it's important , you know , to have two scroll wheels because , you know , you want one for the channel , but you also want one for the volume , because it's the volume i it's , you know it's very handy for it to have instant kind of feedback and response , so . # UI: I've also included this turbo button because I think , you know , every design should have a turbo button , and well # ME: What's a turbo button ? # UI: so this is you know , a unique problem with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television , the tuner on the T_V_ is not gonna be able to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll , so you know , the th the person might want to have a Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them , in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then , you know , displays that station . # UI: Or they might want to scroll and have a quick glimpse of it , even if it lags behind what they're doing . # ME: It con it controls the speed ? # UI: so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if , you know , if I'm if I'm going if I'm scrolling past them and you know , it's , you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel you know it's really going fast or whatever . # UI: So , that's , those are the two important features I think we need on the remote , but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need , . # UI: You know , i it could be , you know , if we if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device , I mean , we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very , if it's gonna be a banana , you know that's a pretty gimmicky kind of thing that doesn't have that much functionality , it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana # UI: and it's still very it may even be for most for some people more functional than their current remote , but if they have these scroll wheels , so , you know , what other buttons do we want ? # UI: I mean we could have well , I guess you need an on and off switch , # UI: but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe , you know , it's kind of like a spy kind of flick thing . # ME: So sounds crazy . # ME: I like crazy ideas . # UI: That's why you're a marketing guru . # PM: So i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the L_C_D_ thing . # UI: Well , that's the thing , have we decided that we can only spend , twenty five Euro ? # UI: Well not spend , but you know , charge twenty five Euro . # ME: I think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so . # PM: No we can we can't use that . # ME: we can ? We can't . # PM: We can't use that to comman co communicate , # ID: Communicate . # PM: it's just a thing # ME: , but we can say channel twenty five . # UI: But then you have to have a template for every channel , for a hundred channels , you have to be able to recognize # ME: It's not a lot one hundred templates , # UI: Well , I f I think it's probably more than , than our can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine , you know , to say hello in the morning . # ME: it's not , it's designed for a cof okay . # ME: Is it design for a coffee machine ? # UI: Well that's its current application , I would presume that it's kind of , they wouldn't design it to handle a hundred things th so . # ME: Maybe you could ask your the you could ask the engineering department if we can # PM: You want to g to move to your slides ? # PM: You're finished ? # UI: Well I just I just made the point , I don't I don't know if that speech recognition is , you know , even if we can do it , I think it's not really appropriate for television environment . # UI: But I did have one thing from a previous meeting , you were talking about being able to find the remote control and I was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having you know , a base station that can control other things as well . # UI: It might be useful to have some kind of base station , even if it's just you press on a button on it and the remote control starts beeping , you know , this is a way of finding the remote . # UI: Y in that case maybe the maybe the speech recognition the speech thing could be useful just to say I'm here # UI: but it's probably a bit of overkill if you could just have a beeping # ID: So it's a speech synthesis kind of thing , # ID: something has been stored and it's just spoken out . # UI: It's it's speech synthesis and s it's speech kind of , not really speech recognition , but kind of pattern matching , # PM: Okay , let's move on . # ID: So this is going to be about the component design . # ID: So first thing is we need power source for the remote control . # ID: So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies , one is the usual batteries which are there , they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing and on top of that we can have solar cells , when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty innovative kind . # ID: Then we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces , there should be some flexibility in t # UI: I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy . # ID: So there should we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve . # ID: The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve . # ID: Then controls for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them . # UI: So , just one second , when you say double curve , what do you actually mean ? # UI: You reckon you could like draw us a thing on the , on the whiteboard 'cause I'm not sure # ID: Double curve is , you have curves on both the sides if I'm right . # ID: So it's symmetrical kind of thing , whatever it is . # UI: but like , kind of convex or concave ? # ID: So , it could be curve , so it could be convex , conve concave , depending on what we want . # ID: So there are flats , there are single curve and there are double curves . # ID: These are the three things , and there are different materials , with plastic you can have double curve but with certain other materials we cannot have double curve . # ID: So there was there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things , but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one , it'll bring the cost down # UI: Although , you know , wood could be quite a stylish option , # ID: and anyway it's # UI: if you take like , nice quality kind of wood that's got a nice grain and you kind of put some , some varnish on . # PM: Mm but i but there is no elasticity which could be # ID: Wooden cases # UI: Well it depends , I mean , you have the outs the wood itself is not gonna break so you don't have to worry too much about the case being broken , # PM: but the components inside . # UI: it's the inside . # UI: but inside you know you could have you can still have some kind of cushioning that's not visible to the to the user . # PM: Very too expensive to do . # UI: And I mean you could also , you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well . # PM: but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than in wood . # UI: That's true , but are we set on the banana idea ? # PM: Well it look like # PM: it looks like you are all targeting that # ME: I was thinking that the shape of a banana is not it's not really handy . # ME: I don't know the name o in English # ID: Is it an e apple which has # ME: it's not a fruit it's a vegetable . # UI: It's like a pumpkin or # UI: What does it taste like ? # ME: And you put in the salad . # PM: Pep pepperoni . # UI: what's it in French ? # UI: , okay , so capsicum or pepper . # ME: And it's al it also suits with the double curve for easy of # UI: I don't know , it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me , like # UI: like with a banana you can have # PM: you think it's really fancy and fun ? # PM: You think that young people that are # ME: I'm sure it's fun . # PM: . More than a banana ? # ME: But banana is not so handy , # ID: Banana is more handier as compared to this I think , and to capsicum . # ME: I think that's handier . # UI: But like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top and just roll it back and forth like that , # PM: It's kind it's kind of it's more # UI: but with I don't know how you would hold a capsicum and # PM: it's really ergonomic , it's fit in the hand and you've a lot of surface to put the controls . # PM: Okay let's move on . # PM: So time is running , let's move on . # ID: Okay , so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated , and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection , volume control and teletext browsing . # ID: These are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company and we can go ahead with that . # ID: , we can go to the next slide . # ID: Then there are different kind of chips , one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip . # ID: So we can have regular chip for control . # ID: Pricing is a factor for us , that's why we'll go for the regular chip . # ID: And regular chip supports speaker support , so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced . # UI: So is that , when you say speaker support , you mean it just has some output pinned which kind of # ID: It could be a beep kind of thing . # UI: but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way , or is just the signal ? # ID: Yes , yes , that's right , it's onto the chip , most probably , not hundred per cent sure about that . # UI: So are there any issues where we place this chip to make sure you can actually hear the speaker from the outside of the banana ? # ID: That will be the volume control I think which a user shou it should be already pre-defined . # ID: It should be whatever will be the case , the chip is always going to be sitting inside . # UI: , but the speaker , if the speaker is actually on the chip , then if it's too far away from the casing , or if the casing is too thick , then you may not hear the speaker . # ID: , so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better . # ID: or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place , # UI: So that's something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the speaker close enough to the outside . # ID: so that That's right . # ID: So these were the component selection and these things . # ID: We can go to the next slide . # ID: And these were the findings which I saw with the web , that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control , so our T_V_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like V_C_R_ D_V_D_ players which are usually attached with the T_V_ , because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything , so with this additional little , we might be having slightly better market for us . # UI: Although , if It depends , if we like , if we are concentrating on like a fruit design , then maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit , you know , like a different fruit for each device . # UI: Cause that , you know , that sometimes people like to collect you know things that of a similar type . # ID: Remotes objects , okay . # PM: Crazy objects . # ME: I think that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits . # UI: Well , you're the one who wanted to do fruit in the first place . # ME: No but I think just one fruit to control everything . # UI: Like a power fruit . # ME: A power fr a power M a Mando , a Supermando fruit . # ID: And as well as I could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really hot thing s and we should have it on the remote . # ME: Actually I didn't understand very well this trace speaker lost control . # ID: So you're having a basis station . # ID: usually your remote sits on that . # ID: and it's that's why it can have chargeable batteries . # ME: So you have to buy two things , the banana and the basis station . # ID: Basis station is with the thing . # PM: You s you thing . # ID: It's like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there . # ID: So now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries , they're rechargeable batteries , so over the period of cor time he'll recover the cost . # ID: So you're having the basis station and there is a button , if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is . # UI: I think that's a pretty handy feature . # UI: I think it's kind of people would find that worth it even if it wasn't a recharging station , even if they didn't have to buy extra batteries , you know . # ME: but I'm a bit worried about the budget . # ID: this is basis station is nothing more , just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and you're having one socket on which the thing sits . # UI: Although you do need to include R_F_ kind of circuitry in the remote . # ID: But all these things are usually in-house so we don't have much problems . # ID: So component cost is going to be the least . # ID: Anyway , we are not using really advanced technology , L_C_D_ has already been ruled out , A_S_R_ has been ruled out . # ID: So it's the basic thing but very trendy and very user-friendly . # UI: I'm just wondering actually , 'cause , you know , I this whole fruit thing with the banana , it's it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of niche , like only a few people would really want a banana , but what if it was kind of a stylised banana ? # UI: You know , rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana , you could make it kind of silver . # UI: And , you know to give you kind of the idea of a banana but without it looking you know completely kitsch . For better want of a better word # PM: You think that yellow it's kitsch . # UI: Well , you know , I don I don't know how many peop # PM: If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana . # ID: A , otherwise it'll be mis means you don't get b any feeling then . # ME: Maybe li like that . # ID: It's neither a banana nor a # UI: , like this colour this colour Maybe , you know , maybe like still in the shape of a banana . # UI: , but you know , just maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana and just kind of , you know because the thing is it's gonna be a little bit difficult to make to give like the texture of a banana anyway and to k to have the exact shape . # UI: I think if you're gonna not be able to do it properly you may as well do it in a stylised way that just looks a bit more kind of , you know , twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies . # PM: Okay . Let's move on . # ID: And going to the last slide . # PM: Before before st before ending the meeting I'd like to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype . # PM: Well no , not you , you can finish your slides before # ID: so . Anyway , users'll be so the findings is users'll be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes . # ID: So that was very I thought it's a very good suggestion by everybody . # PM: Okay , so mm so well done for the presentations . # PM: So we need to take some de decisions about what we're going to do . # PM: So I propose that you go to the whiteboard and we're going to report all the ideas we had we had during this these presentations just to draw some sketch about what will be the prod final product and where Superman go banana and extra func functionalities such as wheels , the speaker unit well not in order not to lost the device , I do I don't remember you call it ? # ID: That's right . The basis station . That's right . # PM: Basis station , . # PM: so we're going for a stylish banana shape . # UI: so , I guess you wanna hold like the way the end of the banana you wanna kind of hold as ma you maybe wanna kinda hold like a gun rather than 'cause you don't want it to point kind of towards the floor . # UI: you know , so if you have like # ME: What about what about this shape ? More or less . # ID: There's less space on this to put with the buttons . # PM: I if it i if it has really the model shape of a bana you could # ME: but how many buttons do we need ? # PM: the starting is good but it could it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really a at the thing . # PM: If you don't want to do that movement which is which is difficult if you don't have to do it in fact , it's better . # PM: So ti time is running , # PM: we have to we have to we have to move forward . # PM: So let's skip to this idea . # PM: So we have this . # PM: We have a basis , how do you call it ? # ID: The base station . # PM: A base station . # PM: We'll have a base station extra on the side . # UI: so I guess we need , you know , something that can fit a banana shaped object . # PM: , we have a R_F_ for beeping for beeping . # ID: That's right , we need that , . # PM: We need b R_F_ to beep . # PM: So we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis . # ID: Basis station . # PM: Basis station , thank you . # UI: Alright , so we need # PM: Can you go quickly please ? # PM: So we are going to add also you as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels and your tur turbo button . # UI: which I think it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the device , # ID: Turbo button . # PM: on the th , maybe here . # PM: And the and the wheel a at the level of the thumb for instance . # UI: , so you have the thumb kind of here . # PM: And and you have two wheels . # UI: So , you need one here and one on the other side , so you got volume an and channel . # UI: Oh we need a we need a power on off switch as well . # ID: for the remote ? # PM: Oh , just the switch , # ID: Remotes don't have power on off switch . # PM: no f not for the T_V_ for the T_V_ . # ID: S no , that'll be controlled by the those buttons'll be there already , . # ID: Means on the remote . # ID: Because remote is going to have both the interfaces , scroll as well as buttons . # ID: They are not going to cost you much , everything is in-house and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this . # UI: Well , I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a banana remote in the first place , you know . # ID: That's that's another issue which I didn't think of . # UI: Y I mean you need to kind of keep it # ID: But you know our targets are very high , means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make . # UI: , how many of these did we wanna sell ? # UI: I can't remember , # ID: Twelve point five is the profit on one . # UI: , but how many units did we need to sell ? # ID: forty th four . # ID: Point point four million ? # ME: Four millions ? # UI: Four point four million . # ID: Point four million . # UI: That's a lot of fruit . # ID: In the market . # PM: Time is running , we have to close the meeting in a few minutes . # PM: So , okay , the next step , you can come back to your seat . # PM: The next step is to go for to f is to go to building a prototype , based on this , So next meeting you guys have to prepare the followi things . # PM: You have to work on the look and feel design and you have to work on the user interface , in fact you two you have to work together to model the first f first prototype . # PM: Marketing Expert have to go to product evaluation . # ME: I wo what about adding the this word spotting , keyword spotting recognition saying volume up volume down ? # PM: It's too difficult . # ME: It's too difficult but people like innovation and that's really innovative and I don't know if it would cost a lot , just a few five words . # PM: It's not a possi it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype , so t it's in the next prototype so let's skip it . # ID: For the future prototypes . # PM: for the n if it works well , we'll go for an orange one . # UI: That can be the t That can be like the turbo banana plus commando . # PM: , honour the fruit . # ME: Plus plus , okay . # ME: Maybe objective banana ? # PM: Thanks very much . # PM: We'll see n next meeting . # ID: So meeting's over ? # UI: We have to go design the prototype . # ID: The problem is after all this meeting there is .
# PM: Good afternoon again . # PM: So we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . # PM: So here is the agenda for today . # PM: just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . # PM: And we'll have presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our Marketing Experts . # PM: Then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and hopefully we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh Euro . # PM: if I go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting . # PM: So we went through th w we took this following decisions . # PM: No L_C_D_ , no speech recognition technology , okay , we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control . # PM: We went through the use of wheels and but buttons . # PM: And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and also to call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost . # PM: So guys let this wonderful thing . # ID: Okay so we can go to the slides . # ID: Number three . # ID: Oh number two # ID: So final design . Final design . # ID: Okay so Michael you can go ahead . # UI: so following our decision to make a yellow well to make a banana # PM: can you show it to the camera maybe . # UI: remote okay so we actually have a # ID: You can pull it out first , maybe . # UI: well first of all we made a an attractive base station with a banana leaf look and feel and bana sit the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over and this is the remote itself , it's kind of it's ergonomic , it fits in the hand rather well . # UI: We've got the two scroll wheels here which you know one on the left for the volume and the one on the right for the channel and underneath we have the turbo button which is in like a nice trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally . # PM: What's the use of the t turbo button already ? # UI: This is when you when you are scrolling the through the channels you can tell it to skip th past channels that you quickly rather th # PM: an then you stop when you stop it stops . # UI: Well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops . # UI: But normally with it will just s stay on each station briefly so you can see the picture . # ID: And we do have one more functionality . # ID: If you take the banana as such and you press the turbo button , so it switch ons the switch ons the T_V_ . # UI: The s the turbo button . # ID: The turbo button . # UI: So rather than having an extra button for the on off switch you just use the turbo button . # ID: Additional button . # ME: What this button for ? # UI: This is a teletext button . # UI: So once you press that then you get teletext and you can use the channel selector scroll wheel as # PM: To navigate it through th through teletext . # ME: But if you want to go to page seven hundred ? # ID: That's right , that's right . # PM: with the wheel it's easy . # UI: Well then you can you have like a little number selection thing , you press the teletext button to move between the fields and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have s you go you scroll to seven and then zero and then you can # ME: I don't understand it . # ME: Can you repeat it ? # UI: Well you can you can press the teletext button and then you then you can you can f # ID: So then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing . # ID: And you can tele # ME: okay . Okay . Okay okay . # ID: once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume . # ME: I see . I see . Okay . Okay . # UI: And this is the infrared port . # UI: Also the top of the banana . # UI: So . And then we have in the in the base station we have the button at the front for calling the banana . # PM: And the leaves plays the roles of antennas ? # UI: Actually they do . # UI: That's that's form and function in the one in the one object . # ID: So it always means , whatever the rays goes by they get reflected and then you are having a better coverage . # ID: It's like antennas . # UI: But that's just like that's an attractive base station . # ID: And for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for charging the batteries . # ME: Is it really weight ? # ME: Is it light or # ID: It is very light . # PM: , they're light . # UI: It's it's about the weight of a banana . # UI: You know , to give you the correct look and feel . # ID: And we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana . # ID: Otherwise it's you know a child comes and so # ME: yeah , I see . I under I understand . # UI: I think a child would try to eat it anyway , so maybe we should consider that . # UI: maybe health and safety aspects . # ID: Oh we didn't think of that yet . # PM: So for the power source , apparently you still you want to use both solar cells and batteries . # ID: Oh that's right . # PM: you mean okay . So # UI: I don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station . # PM: where are going to where are you are you going to place them ? # ID: It'll be always at top somewhere at there . # UI: If I was gonna place them I'd put them on the on the top here since that's like the black bit # PM: You have enough surface ? # UI: but I don't I really don't think it's necessary to have the solar cells anymore . # ID: because now we are having rechargeable batteries so that is . # PM: What will be the autonomy ? Roughly ? # UI: The what sorry ? # PM: The autonomy . # UI: What do you mean ? # PM: I mean how long does i how long can it be held off a station ? # ME: How long the how long the bit the batteries long . # ID: Eight to ten eight to ten hours . # UI: it should be weeks . # ID: no most of the time it's not being used . # UI: but y people don't like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wanna leave it on the couch so # ID: So when you are making it on # PM: It's used only when you # ID: No eight or eight or ten hours of working . # ID: If you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer . # ID: And we are having the speakers regular chip for control . # ID: Pricing is was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip . # PM: Those really sounds very good . # PM: Nothing else to add ? # UI: It seems to be falling over . # ME: I like I like it . # ME: Maybe the thing that convince me the less is the multifunctional buttons . # ID: You want to have more functional buttons ? # ME: Looks a bit puzzled I dunno how to say that . # ID: You are not convinced . # ME: You the b the buttons change h their function depending if y it's teletext or not # ID: Not not many , we want to keep it simple . # ID: So that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case , that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that , the channel buttons , they baco become the scrolling buttons . # ME: And the volume button will become # ID: It's up to you , means . # PM: Well in fact b both will be could be useful , navigating through teletext . # ID: Now that Means let's say this can move the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits . # UI: Or can move between positions in the in the number . # ME: And what about people who want to use digits ? # ME: Butto real buttons ? # ID: So there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape . # ID: So we are targeting a segment which is which is just very trendy kind of thing , they don't care about the buttons any more . # ME: Because have you thought about configuration and all this kind of stuff ? # UI: It's all automatic . # ME: It's all automatic . # ME: Okay it's fine . # ME: W we are living in a wonderful world . # PM: Bananas everywhere . # ME: Automatically configure . # PM: So we have to go through now evaluations . # PM: So your slides are ready ? # PM: you're four I think . # PM: So this is one , which one is this one ? # ME: I const I constructed a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements . # ME: And each criteria is will be evaluated it's logical criteria so we must users must say i if it's true or is or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven . # ID: Why this strange factor of seven ? # ME: Because i I'm sorry . Sorry . # ID: Usually I have seen that scales are from one to ten . # ME: It's from it's from one to seven . It's from one to seven Because it should be an even it should be an even scale , # ME: and five is too short and nine is too long . # ID: Okay fine , got the idea . # PM: So to have in order to have enough granularity it's in order to have enough granularity in the evaluation . # ME: The variance is mi it's is minimal . # ME: I'm answering your question . # ME: And that's the criteria I found more useful . # ME: I think I sh I could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard ? # ME: And we all four could range could evaluate the # ID: So you can say fancy , # ME: Okay let's evaluate if it's fancy or # ID: , it's fancy , according to me . # ID: Seven . Seven by me . # ME: I would say seven . # ME: It's quite fancy . # ID: So you can add seven plus six plus seven plus # PM: What do you say seven ? # UI: maybe six it's I guess it's # PM: Okay , six point five . # ID: Again I'll give seven . # UI: I'd give it a six like I'd I think it's probably more handy than my current remote , 'cause of the scroll wheels but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason but you know you can always use your other remote . # PM: So seven , seven , # PM: six point five . # ID: I'll give five . # UI: Well it depends when you say functional , do you mean it does what we want it to do , or d does what it does , you know , can it make you coffee ? # ME: Everything ar # PM: for a remote control , does he have all the # ME: Mm everything # PM: you could expect . # ME: It's compared to the all # ME: remote controls . # UI: That's before # ID: The standards . What is available in the market off the shelf . # UI: I have to say four . # ME: Actually I don't know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro # UI: Well it's not a universal remote . # UI: Remember we're focus we're supposed to focus just on T_V_s . # ME: it's not an univer but it's for all kind of T_V_s ? # UI: Well all T_V_s but only T_ only T_V_s I guess . # PM: So it's universal but for T_V_s . # ID: So four point two ? # UI: Obviously there are some outliers so # PM: Okay cool ? Cool device . # ID: There I'll give it seven . # ME: It means cool features , like new features actually . # ID: For a T_V_ the most important feature which I felt was the locator which is a cool feature . # ID: And then the scroll buttons are again cool features . # ID: We don't have L_C_D_ for it but that we decided we don't want to have . # ME: I would say five . # PM: Plus six , I say I said seven . # ME: You said seven ? # UI: 'Cause it's five seven so , okay , definitely easy to use . # ID: Definitely seven . # PM: Outl you are not lik outlier . # UI: Alright , now here's the sixty million Dollar question , well , twenty five twenty five Euro question . # PM: Of course I'll buy the banana . # UI: What do you what do you guys reckon ? # ME: Of cour Of course the most difficult question for the end . # PM: Twenty five Euros . # ME: I find it quite cheap actually . # ME: I dunno . If i it depends , if you live in Switzerland or you live in # PM: so the target price is for all Europe , or only for rich countries ? # PM: It's more targeting U_K_ or # ME: Wha the initial specifications were for the whole all Europe or # PM: So this is selling costs , not production costs . # ME: this is the initial specifications . # ME: I would say six . # ME: It's quite cheap actually . # PM: Aw , should be nice in your # UI: I don't want a banana on my living room table , a banana remote . # ID: No but it's really handy actually if you see . # UI: It is handy , it's handy , but it it's terrible . # ID: It's it's so handy . # ID: Anyb anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this . # UI: , but it's not a positive thing . # ID: It's a very positive thing if you see like that . # UI: Well , you know , it's handy , it's ergonomic , but it's a banana . # PM: Well , don't forget well , don't for don't forget who we're targeting also who are f who are wh # UI: but it says I , I would buy this , so . # ME: Actually maybe # PM: No well if you would be young . # PM: Not telling that you are young . # PM: Li li like a teenager for instance . # UI: No , it's I . I would buy # PM: you're crazy teenager and you like fun things . # ID: You want to flaunt . # ID: You with your girlfriend or something . # PM: , you want to show the beautiful banana you have . # ID: Or might be it does some other kind of thing but # UI: Still I I'd say two . # UI: I don't think I at any stage in my life I would want a banana remote control , really . # PM: Okay so you s you give # UI: I can say , maybe there is a market for it , I dunno . # PM: oh yeah I know I know . # PM: So you say two . # PM: F I d I say five . # ME: I change the question . # PM: So what's the new question ? # ID: And you have saved it ? # ME: So upload the # ID: You'll have to reload . # UI: Okay , so , it depends if # ME: it's two different situations . If you really need an universal remote control or if you would change your remote control for a n for a new one . # PM: that's two different question . # UI: If I had t if I had to spend twenty five Euro , if that was like my limit , maybe I would buy it . # UI: Because the other twenty five Euro remote controls are probably gonna look worse than a banana . # ID: They're not going to be as And they might not be a as easy as this # UI: this is gonna f you know handy to use . # ME: So ? What now ? What range ? # PM: I stick to five . # UI: Although it still has it still has the word of course at the beginning # ID: I go slightly up . # PM: W we have six , five # UI: I'd give it I'd give it a I give it a four now . # PM: So we are six , five , four # ID: Six , five , four . # ME: Six , so it's five point five , or less . # PM: So and last question , will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana . # PM: No let's say I'll put two . # UI: I'd say three , I mean my remote control is kinda at home is pretty terrible . # UI: If it was change my remote control of my D_V_D_ player for a Mando banana then I would be more inclined to # PM: It's for the T_V_ . # UI: but 'cause it's really bad but I'd say a three . # ID: I'll still give it five . # PM: Two three five two three fi and two . # ME: You are romantic , really . # ID: So it's somewhere three point five I think . # ME: I would say two . # PM: So it's r , three point five . # ME: Who is the outlier ? # ME: Wh wh you said five ? # PM: No no you say five , he is the outlier . # ID: No I said five . # PM: Okay just do a sum . # ME: I don't know if it's a # UI: It's not very promising but you know we're not young trendsetters . # ME: No because there are more , we shouldn't sum like that . # PM: Well maybe we should we should have a look globally glob # ME: Because the last two questions is much more important than the rest actually . # ME: Otherwise we wouldn't we will not sell . # UI: Is there some formula you're using that says you have to sum them up ? # ME: no I didn't anything . # UI: Well just leave it at that then . # PM: So maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling . We can had have a out of these numbers , which is that well we should go for it . # PM: Problem with connectors ? # ME: Do you want me to sum # ME: o I think it's not # UI: I think it kind of you just lose information if you sum it , so . # PM: So let's move let's move on . # PM: Okay , now we have to mm to estimate the cost okay . So I prepare an Excel sh an Excel sheet . # PM: well we are going to calculate the production costs . # PM: We should we should be below twelve point five . # PM: So I already put some pu some numbers here , okay . # PM: We are going to go through so this is the number the mm number of components we need for this thing . # PM: So it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about . # PM: and also things that I d I forget to put like solar cells . # UI: Well we decided against the solar cells so # PM: Oh finally we say no . # ID: Solar cells , yeah , we said no to that . # PM: Okay so let's go let's go let go through all the lines . # PM: So hand dynamo . # PM: This something we didn't thought about . # UI: You mean , charging it by shaking the banana . # ID: I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing . # PM: Okay so we stick to battery , one . # ID: To bring the cost # PM: No kinetic also . # PM: I don't I don't see the difference between kinetic and dynamo . # UI: Well maybe dynamo is like you have to actually # PM: you have to okay I see so kinetic is really shaking the banana . # PM: So those banana is falling . # PM: Let's go ahead . # PM: So we st only have one for battery . # PM: then for electronics so I didn't put anything for the . # ID: So we have the regular chip on the print , which is one . # ID: And we have sample speaker . # ID: the cost of that is very high . # PM: Ooh ye the cost is increasing . # UI: Well actually that no that sample speaker is not we we're not using that , we're just using the very beep simple beep , # UI: that s that sample thing is like the voice recording and everything . # PM: That's what so I'll remove it . # PM: So don't we need a # ID: And we have sev # PM: Oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing . # ID: So we we'll put some extras , if there is something . # PM: We'll see later . # PM: Okay so in for the case I put single curved . # ID: To reduce the cost , it's okay . # UI: Well , wait a second , # PM: Because we have two things . # UI: no , it's double curved , it's got a c , it's # ID: Oh it's got all the directions so don't worry . # UI: Well d it's monotonic but # ID: It's got a direction . # UI: it's got but if you hold it if you hold it that way that's two curved , one on this side , one on that side , but they're opposite sides . # PM: what i if I put one here . # UI: This is actually I mean this probably # ME: Actually what's the differen # UI: this probably actually costs more than three # PM: so let's put one here in the then instead of single # PM: oka all right . # PM: So we stick to plastic , it cost nothing . # UI: Well no didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber # UI: if you drop it ? # ME: Too expensive . # PM: It's too expensive . # PM: We're already at eleven . # UI: Well when Well we we'll come back we'll come back and see if we can fit it in . # PM: so I put rubber one . # PM: Okay so special colour , yellow . # PM: for the interface we have # ID: We don't have any push buttons . # UI: No , we have two push buttons . # PM: We have three . # ID: No that is a scroll wheel itself , it'll be put in that . # PM: We have two scroll , and we have three push buttons . # UI: Okay it's gonna have to be plastic . # ME: Actually whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two , because there is another chip here . # PM: No it's no chip . # PM: This is just radio frequency . # PM: Th This is no chip . # ID: No . There's no chip there . # ID: It just emits the signal . # ID: And the receiver accepts it and that's it . # ME: Fo i it does nothing actually ? # ID: Just se sends the signal , that's it . # UI: It's a recharger thing # PM: Okay w we didn't think a thought about integrated scroll wheel push buttons . # UI: Well I actually did think about it myself but I thought you know because you could potentially you know you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a instead of a turbo button but you know the turbo button does add that extra class . # UI: So I mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that . # PM: So no L_C_D_ , so for we have no button supplements , well in fact could we could not we consider this button as a button supplement because these are these are for colours , co and special forms , special colours and special materials . # UI: No we're not we don't need anything special for the buttons . # PM: Okay so we are over budget . # ID: So first thing which we should take care of is , # UI: Make it plastic instead of rubber . # ID: instead of rubber , let it be plastic . # UI: And then we're basically o on budget except for you know ten cents . # ID: And that much money will be required for the base station , which is not there . # PM: So mayb in fact n we have to put two here because it cost nothing . # UI: well pl the base station is made out of m many units of plastic . # ID: So might be ninety centimes for the remaining things which the cord and everything which'll go # PM: Exactly exactly so we have margin for that stuff . # UI: Does that include charging circuitry and everything ? # UI: So what do we do with the extra profits ? # PM: we'll invest in R_ and D_ . # UI: The next fruit . # PM: So well we're under the cost . # PM: So we can go to through to project evaluation . # ME: Okay so now we have a product which nobody would buy . # ME: Would , would buy . # UI: No we have a product which none of us would buy . # ME: because th the evaluation project # PM: Which is different . Which is different . # PM: None of us will buy it . # UI: No it's people in Milan and in Paris that are gonna buy it . # UI: We're not in Milan or Paris . # ME: you have been in Milan a couple of times , so . # PM: This is a battery . # UI: Actually there were a lot of # ME: And you said the lowest . # PM: This is what we which you can mm # ID: Detachable battery . # UI: That's 'cause I'm sick of Milan . # ME: , for the batteries # PM: Extra battery , . # UI: Okay so project process . # PM: Well in fact I did not know I didn't know really what to say here . # PM: If if you have any ideas of what we can we can say . # PM: I don't I don't I don't understand what they mean by satisfaction and for and for example . # PM: Should it be more like a status of the these meetings in fact . # PM: well in fact we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen , not that much . # UI: I dunno I think we had a fair bit of creativity . # PM: Oh it's really creative . # UI: And but I think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a like a focus group with the actual people we're targeting . # UI: We needed some of these kind of young trendsetters to come in and play with the banana and you know see if they # ID: They like that . # UI: see if they like it . # PM: maybe we should go through , an evaluation . # UI: Because the evaluation for us is kind of pointless . # PM: So maybe you should we should do a kinda evaluation in the streets like asking to young peoples well , do you like to have a banana as a remote control . # UI: Because it would also be interesting to you to know find out if we have a market in really young children as well , to see you know how to how to market this thing . # UI: 'Cause you know if well I mean maybe you don't wanna give all your kids their own remote because they'll be changing the channel all the time but you know maybe in some households where there is you know a T_V_ for each kid , then you know , banana remote control could be fun for them as well . # UI: Might have to draw a face on it . # UI: So but I think that's something we need to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market . # PM: Any any new ideas we could we could investigate next time ? # PM: Dunno , oranges ? # ID: The cost of the thing can be made more than might be . # ID: Because I think it's just the optimal , what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to . # UI: I think there are ways we could maybe simplify the # UI: Well just the circuit board that we're using inside , I'm not sure really how complicated our needs are . # UI: I mean all we have is two push buttons and two scrollers , do we really need an integrated circuit to you know to process that . # ME: So more general remote control instead of just focusing on T_V_ . # ME: The complexity shouldn't be much higher . # ME: you said if it good for D_V_D_ then I would # UI: And also fo you know for mood lighting and stuff , that would be rather cool . # UI: I think that's actually something that should be in version two , is the ability to you know to control things other than the T_V_ # UI: and not just electronic equipment but you know the whole environment of the room . # PM: I think we can go # ID: Happily satisfied . # PM: Maybe maybe we can hassle the production department to make a real prototype that we can use at home to evaluate . # PM: Okay so thanks very much .
# PM: 'Kay , hello everybody . # PM: , I guess you all know what is it about , you all received the email , I guess . # PM: , we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control . # PM: So I'm going to be the project manager of this project . # PM: And so I'm present myself . # PM: I'm Fabien Cardinaux and I guess you can present yourself . # PM: So I dunno , you can starts . # ID: so my name is Petre . # ID: You can call me Petre , or Peter if you like . # ME: my name's Bob Mor . # PM: And you are ? In the project ? # ID: , in the project I'm supposed to be the technic . # ME: 'Kay . So my name's Bob Morris . # ME: I'm the Marketing Expert for this project . # UI: My name is Hamed Getabdar , and I'm going to be Interface Designer in this project . # PM: So , so today we are doing a short meeting to present the project , so We are gooding we are going to present the tool we are we are going to use during all this project . # PM: We are talking about the project plan , and we are going to discuss about st our first ideas and so on , So we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting . # PM: So what is the goal of this project ? Is to design a new remote control . # PM: So it should be , of course , new and original , and it should be trendy , and user friendly . # PM: That mean it's a very challenging project , . So w it's we will try to do our best , and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy . # PM: So what's what are we going to do during this all this project ? # PM: So it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way . # PM: and everything is will be like this . # PM: so now we are going to get used t to the tools we are going to use all during all this project . # PM: So we can try to use the whiteboard here . # PM: For example we can try to write what is our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it . # PM: So I will ask you all to do the same . # PM: Just to get used to the whiteboard . # ID: So probably I would try to try to draw the animal . # ID: Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal ? # PM: , you can draw the picture , of course . # ID: I th I think I should . # ID: Okay , American , . # ID: I would use the bird . # ID: So I tried to sketch it out . # ID: I had to first write it down because I am not absolutely sure if I can draw it , but . # ID: Can you recognise it as a bird ? # ID: Okay it's your turn to # ME: So I think my favourite animal would be a c a cat . # ME: That's its head . # ME: I probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and playful . # UI: I dunno if I should go with this . # UI: If it is enough line . # ME: Maybe put it up # ME: Put it a Maybe put it on the desk or something . # ID: I should get used to the tool , so . # ID: Oh just wait a little bit . # ID: C could we put it here , to make it as straight as possible ? # ID: probably not . # UI: They should be remote . # ID: Okay , it works like this . # ME: , that's better . # ME: Your lapel microphone's fallen off . # ID: Are you left-handed ? # UI: Should I clean ? # UI: Okay , I think like horses because they are strong and beautiful , so if I want to write it here , I think I can . # ID: , it's maybe better if you leave it . # ME: Maybe we should just continue . # ME: , don't worry about it . # ID: You won't draw them , or ? # PM: You can draw it , if you want . # UI: I dunno if I can . # ID: I would like to see how it looks like . # UI: It may be like a cow or I dunno , whatever . # UI: I'm not good very good in drawing . # UI: Okay , so this is very It's a bird , I think . # UI: I dunno what is it . # ID: No , I think it's clear . # ME: Oh that's good , it's good . # ID: It's in it's indeed beautiful . # ID: Bob . Have to remember it . # PM: So good So , let's talk about money . # PM: we are going to sell we want to sell this remote control for twenty five Euro . # PM: And our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro . # PM: And we are trying to have a market all around the world . # PM: So n not only for Switzerland , but for the world . # PM: We expect a production cost of maximum twelve point fifty Euro . # ID: Per unit , I guess . # PM: , so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control , and any idea ? # PM: So , if you have some experience , good or bad , with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea . # ME: Well , from experience , I've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small , and it's been very hard to use , because there's so many buttons , and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what , and the buttons are very small and very hard to press . # ME: and normally you only every use , you know , on a T_V_ remote you only ever use , mostly , you know , f four or f six buttons . # ME: So it's frustrated me in the past , th that . # ID: Okay , I have also some points . # ID: Maybe two points . # ID: first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light , so if you are if you are playing with this in the dark room it's probably worth to have something like back light . # ID: And maybe it could be also dependant on the amount of light in the room , so that if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so . # ID: So something like this . # ID: And the second thing , f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is there are two buttons for volume control . # ID: But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like . # ID: You know , some slider or Not just two discrete buttons for volume , but something which # ME: Is that because the of the discrete volume levels , or is that # ID: , but I can reach In one second I can mute it down , or make a high volume . # PM: Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the volume can go up very quickly and it can # ID: If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream . # PM: also if y when you take the remote control , for example on the table , you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud , and # ID: , f It depends what you feel about that . # PM: you have a heart attack . # ID: but we can we can think of these things afterwards , but if you have some more notes on that . # PM: so you can Do you have something ? # UI: just a simple experience . # UI: I prefer remote control working with radio waves , because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune . # PM: without obstacles and . # PM: Okay . Let's continue . # PM: I have a meeting in five minutes , so maybe we should hurry . # PM: So we will close this meeting . # ID: just a second . # PM: So we will have a next meeting in thirty minutes . # PM: The So I will ask you to do some work . # PM: the interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control , start to have new idea and # ID: Which i which is Hamed , ? # ME: He's the Industrial Designer ? # ME: No , you're the Industrial Designer . # ID: I am the Technical Designer , I dunno which one , v . # PM: Industry and Oh . # ME: I think that's the first . I_D_ . Industrial Designer . # ME: And the second one is the User Interface Designer . # ID: User Interf Okay . # ME: And then last one's marketing , which is me . # ID: Okay , so I'm the first one . # PM: For the User Interface Designer , which is Hamed , you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control . # PM: And for the Marketing Manager , I dunno , okay , which is Bob , you are going to try to find the user requirements f for the remote control . # PM: , you will receive by email the specific instructions and by your personal coach . # PM: Yep finished . # PM: So I see you in thirty minutes .
# PM: So nice to see you again . # PM: Tod for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes . # PM: so we will see our three presentations . # PM: we will start with the Manager Expert wi who will talk about user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device . # ME: can I have the laptop over here , or ? # PM: Oh , I don't think so . # PM: I think you have to come here . # ME: Have to get up . # PM: I think it should stay . # PM: Should stay in the square here . # ME: Okay , so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted into what users want in this remote control . # PM: Oh , you can put it here . # PM: Oh that's okay , it's jus # ME: so first of all we what we did is we conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects . # ME: we put them in a in our usability laboratory and got them to , you know , play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete a questionnaire to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls . # ME: So basically the major things we found out was that basically users don't like the look and feel of most remote controls that are currently on the market . # ME: they , you know , seventy five percent of the people we did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly . # ME: Completely ugly . # ME: they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user , that is , you know , the way users use remote controls when they're watching T_V_ . # ME: , that the layout of the remote controls didn't match they way that they used it . # ME: and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that are on remote controls . # ME: so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics based on how these test subjects were using their remote control . # ME: And from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control . # ME: and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , while the user's watching T_V_ . # ME: the closest button that was used , well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , all the other , all the other buttons , such as ch audio and picture selection configuration buttons and things were used , you know , l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour . # ME: we also asked users which buttons had the most importance to them , you know , which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on the remote control . # ME: And basically they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very high relevance . # ME: and the audio and picture settings had a very that well the users thought that w the audio and picture settings were very weren't very important to them , and they used them very infrequently a as well . # ME: So we asked users what frustrates them the most about current remote controls . # ME: And fifty percent of the users said that what frustrates them is losing the remote control somewhere in the room and not being able to find it . # ME: they also said that it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control , especially when there's many buttons and it's a , you know , a c a unintuitive interface . # ME: and then thirdly , they some users commented on the fact that the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and cause u repetitive strain injury . # ME: We also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the on the remote control . # ME: In particular , do they want an L_C_D_ d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition is a useful feature to have on a remote control . # ME: basically our findings are that amongst a younger age groups the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes . # ME: They want these features , they want these high technology features . # ME: for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features . # ME: Whereas the trend was as users as users became older and older they were less likely to want these sort of features in a in a remote control . # ME: So I guess it depends on where we're focusing our market . # ME: and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics , I think we're focusing on the younger target demographic , and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control . # ME: That's my dic that's my presentation . # PM: maybe now we can talk about a user interface and about the technical function of this device . # PM: So Pet Peter , can you talk say something about that ? # ID: , but the user interface is responsible . # UI: B you think I I'm User Interface Manager . # PM: Sorry , I'm Sorry . Sorry . # UI: If I could go there with this cable . # ID: You're scaring me with L_C_D_ man . # ID: And speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very e expensive . # ME: , it's true , but , you know , they're features that users want , And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per unit is fairly high I think , so I think we can afford to add these sort of features into our remote . # ID: At least we have couple of months t to work on it so it will be cheaper finally . # UI: Where's delete button ? # ME: That's the wrong one , I think . # PM: it's still Bob Morris . # UI: Presentation three ? # PM: you should have put yes . # ID: Because you cancelled it . # UI: Okay , so here is my presentation about technical function design . # UI: I will talk about different components and s of system and how they react together . # UI: Okay , first what is a remote control ? Simply it's a device , as you know , for , for sending some commands by some waves to another device to tell different commands with this device . # UI: And the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device . # UI: i it has different blocks , different blocks . # UI: first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits making interface with keyboard and r reading keyboard and reading the keyboard commands . # UI: And then inter then make these keyboard commands , in interpret these int keyboard commands . # UI: And then there should be an electronic circuit making electronic signals according to these commands and finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a diode making waves to transmit through the air and uh this air this wave will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever , to r to realise the command . # UI: Okay , about what I found about different these different blocks are , usually there are two different methods to for designing a remote control . # UI: They are based on infra-red waves or uh radio waves . # ID: You still want me the presentation . # UI: There are two different uh solutions I mean . # UI: This is this can be uh the differences the th between different kind of waves , infra-red or radio waves . # UI: And also as I understood , and I think it was a part of Bob , uh presentation , people prefer to have to have the remote control with less button . # UI: So for the electronic part , working and interfacing , with button , we should we should try to t try to design a remote control having some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options , and showing o something on T_V_ and putting less lesser stuff on the on the remote control . # UI: And personal preferences , uh certainly a remote control with working with radio waves is preferred because you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way . # UI: And uh again , using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred , as I see . # UI: Okay . That was my presentation . # ME: I have a question . # ME: Do you think radio waves will interfere with other appliances in the home ? # UI: , I don't think so , because we can make we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency . # UI: So they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home . # PM: So can we use any frequency ? # ID: , it should be okay . # PM: We have the right to use any frequency ? # UI: but as I know , there is a range for this f for this stuff , for designing this circuit . # UI: We can we can we can tune our transmitter to work in this range , and for this range we don't need to ask any permission . # PM: And what happen with radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control , for example ? # PM: And so do they have the same frequency , or ? # UI: for this I'm not I don't know the solution , but one solution can be something like putting p password or something inside the wave , so the only your T_V_ can understand it # PM: Okay . A kind of identification , # UI: , identification code inside the # ID: f I know about this , since it's my it's exactly my field , so . # ID: It's kind of handshaking , when starting to when you start to communicate with the your T_V_ then it's like an handshaking protocol with your remote . # ID: So so if two devices are trying to go to communicate with the T_V_ set then the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen . # ID: Well it can be a problem sometimes , but most of the time it works okay . # UI: The password may simply or i identification code may simply solve this problem . # UI: A specific remote control has a specific f # ID: but we don't have to think about this because I think as a function designer that we will use the already made circuits which we probably bu buy . # ID: It's worth to buy . # ID: And they have these problems solved so . # ID: So we don't have to think about these . # PM: So , maybe you can talk about the function , and # ID: I have only a couple of things because I had I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this uh in this company . # ID: I was used to use Linux before , so . # ID: But I tried to tried to break through this too , I guess . # ID: How to make it big ? # ID: Slide show . Okay , thanks . # PM: It should work , so you can . # ID: Oh so I will speak about working design . # ID: That's the first slide . # ID: what I have to do ? # ID: A look at what the other company Okay so presently I am looking what is possible to use , what circuits to use and stuff like that because I didn't work with these circuits so far so I have to look what is a v a v available on the market for the communication for the I_R_ circuits and so on , so I'm currently looking what is available on the web . # ID: And I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there , so , I would be glad if you can tell me about them . # ID: , okay findings , that's the point that I'm working on currently but so far I was looking what are the blue circuit , I mean radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now , but the prices I read are high . # ID: So , I know that the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can you can make the T_V_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on , but you know , when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to change the program and so on and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the infra-red control instead of R_W_ but we will discuss it later maybe . # ID: Components to use , I'm not exactly sure what I will use for the design of the circuit . # ID: It depends on whether we will use the L_C_D_ and mainly the speech recognition , because the speech rec # ME: Are we are we planning to take an off the shelf an O_E_M_ component for the radio wave circuit , or are we planning to construct our own circuit board ? # ID: This we this we buy I think , because it's rather cheap nowadays and it's not worth to construct ourselves . # ME: So we just buy a circuit board and # ID: But I'm not sure about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition . # ID: This I prefer that we should make ourselves . # ID: But it depends whether we take a decision to use it . # ID: It's fairly expensive to use these circuits . # ID: So , speech recognition well , L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_ , so I agree on using any kind of L_C_D_ , less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit . # ID: But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer , you know . # PM: So what do you think would be the price , it would be out of range ? # PM: Or it would be maybe feasible ? # ID: I was not thinking too much about the price . # ID: But if we use the L_C_D_ even the radio frequency communication with the T_V_ set and the backlight and related things like the photo diodes and stuff , it should be okay . # ID: If we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle but we'll see afterwards . # ID: It depends of you if the M_E_ or U_I_D_ , I'm sorry about the names , I don't really know , want to have it like in metal or in plastic , these things , it depends on you not Because the electronic device's price is not so big in comparison to the overall shape and stuff like that , so . # ID: We will discuss it afterwards . # ID: Oh , this is nothing . # ID: This is just my notes on what to use . # ID: And my personal preference is yes , I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit , but from the point of view of the design and price , I would stick to I_R_s . # ID: That's my opinion . # ID: I mean if infra-red circuit not the radio frequency . # PM: Because it's simpler ? # ID: Because because the range where you can use it is fair . # ID: It's okay I think . # ID: And the price is fairly cheap for this . # PM: Okay . It's a price matter . # ID: Well , depends . # ID: Jus just the price . # ID: Otherwise I don't care what I put there because it's the chip which I buy or which we buy . # ID: So I think it's o y o . # ME: What how much more expensive ? # ME: Are we talking three times more expensive ? # ID: Well , three to three to five . # ME: Or ten times more expensive ? # ID: N not ten times , but it depends what we # ME: That's still a lot . # ME: I think it's probably not worth spending the extra money , because I mean all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red , so people don't expect anything other than infra-red . # ME: So it's not worth spending the extra money . # ID: Th they are used to use it when they can see the T_V_ so , I don't know . # PM: On the other side , we want to have something new . # PM: You know , we want to have something new and So we I think we should still thinking about it . # ME: But I think , based on my usability studies I th I feel that users are prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , you know , the difference between infra-red or radio waves . # ME: So I think we're better off spending money in the usability phase . # ID: You the user interface , and management man , okay , that's it for me . # PM: Okay , thank you Peter . # PM: So I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control . # PM: first , they say that's about something about t teletext . # PM: apparently it becomes from according to them it becomes out of date . Out-dated . # PM: Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it's not useful to have teletext . # PM: So I think we can avoid the teletext . # PM: the second thing is they suggest that we should use the remote control only for T_V_ , not for D_V_D_ and other devices , because it make it makes it's too complex and because we have not much time for this project we should stay on T_V_ on the only specific T_V_ remote control . # PM: The third the third one is about the image of the company . # PM: So we should we should keep The the product should be recognisable . # PM: It's That mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is , we put fashion of in electronics . # PM: So , when people see the remote control , they should say oh it's from Real Reaction and he s they should recognise the company . # PM: So now we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this on this remote control . # PM: So , mm , are we going to use L_C_D_ , speech recognition ? # ME: Well , should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need . # ME: And then we can move on to the more advanced features . # ID: Okay , so the available things are L_C_D_ , the buttons and everything . # ID: radio frequency depends . # ID: And , well the recognition it depends on you guys . # PM: but first maybe what is what are the usual function of a standard remote control ? # ID: You should probably speak . # ME: Okay , well , I mean the obvious one is changing channels . # PM: I think we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button . # PM: So , turning channel , of course . Volume setting . # ID: just one note to the chan channel changing . # ID: will we use only two buttons , or like numbered buttons ? # ID: I mean those nine plus one or two ? # PM: I think it would be a b # ID: Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number . # PM: On the other side we have more and more channels , and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want , it's # ID: so we keep all these all these buttons . # PM: Maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens , like # UI: , at least nine , ten button . # ID: Like ten plus , five plus , one plus , one minus or something . # PM: Maybe something like that . # ID: Or using the names and the keyboard I dunno . # UI: Or something . # PM: Oh I don't know . # PM: Maybe we could have key buttons , like discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and # ID: You mean like hierarchical structure . # PM: And inside this thing you can move , maybe switch . # UI: Okay . Like categorising channels . # PM: If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus . # ID: Okay , so s Oh sorry . # PM: I It just an idea . # PM: I don't know what you think about that but . # ID: So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably , to tell you # ME: To have some feedback . # ID: so I'll make a note on L_C_D_ . # ME: We could maybe also c incorporate Petre's idea of the slider for the volume , with the channel . # ME: So we c you could quickly just through many channels . # ID: . Like roller for the # ME: For the channels , perhaps . # PM: Anything else ? # ME: So we've got channel and volume . # ID: So we are still s speaking about the common devices or we are inviting the new one ? # ME: I think basically the core functions we want , and then more advanced ones . # PM: What about the settings of the T_V_ ? # PM: Because it's button we don't use very often , but it's we need it anyway . # UI: So we don't have any we don't have we should just design the remote control and we sh we don't have any access to the to the T_V_ design or we can change some design . # UI: Because one solution for this uh ch changing channels is to see a summary of all channels , some preview of all channels and then you can # ID: On the screen , you mean ? # ID: Not on the control , but on the screen . # UI: Not on the control , on the screen , on the T_V_ screen . # ID: Well , this would avoid L_C_D_ , then . # ME: Oh , I don't but I don't think we're the ones . # ME: I mean this remote control we're developing is a generic control for all T_V_s , I think . # PM: I don't know if it's possible to watch something on T_V_ # ID: W I think it would be better to stick to the remote control and not to bother the T_V_ to print these things . # ID: Well it wi it will be still more expensive , but for the L_C_D_ and this stuff is no problem in the price . # PM: So , what are we doing with the settings ? # PM: Because settings if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons , so . # PM: Maybe with the L_C_D_ we can do something with less buttons , but # ME: But then you don't want to make the L_C_D_ display too complicated at the same time . # ME: I mean there's always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere , under a cover or at the back of under a slide or some # ID: Like ma We we could have for example two buttons like simple mode and advanced mode . # ID: Or like children and grandfather's mode , and the , well the user not the user , the man mana T_V_ manager mode . # ME: So we have five minutes left . # ME: So I think s the settings we th we are agreeing are agreed that they're required . # ME: It's just how to a # PM: We should hide them somewhere . # ID: Hide them , okay . # PM: In the menus of the L_C_D_ or in the back of the remote control , or something like that . # ME: , okay , what else ? # ME: I mean a power button's obviously # ID: This I was thinking . Do we need a power button at all ? # ID: Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ? # ID: Because generally # PM: It's it's a kind of setting , I think . # PM: It should fit in those settings functions . # PM: Because it's not a very current useful function . # ME: , well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off . # PM: No , I think it's after five minutes or something a timer # ME: But if you're watching T_V_ for two hours , you don't want your T_V_ to turn off after five minute # ID: You don't need to every five minutes to keep it alive . # ID: Okay , so we should keep this button . # ME: I mean based on our usability studies again , pe people said that the power button was v a very relevant button . # ME: , you know , it was nine out of ten # ID: so we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff , # ME: re relevance . # ID: we could make it like a opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the T_V_ and if you close it , it will turn off the T_V_ . # ID: If if you like this , # ID: Because , well it's maybe question for you t # ME: I think we need to concentrate on the , you know , the major usage of the th of the control , which is you sit down , you turn on your T_V_ , you change channels , you change the volume , you turn the T_V_ off . # ME: and all the other f functionality is # UI: , they can they can be hide somewhere by a cover or something like this . # ME: not used very often . # UI: Like covering cu . # PM: On the back , or # ID: I mean like the # UI: , like mobile phone covering . # ID: but since we have the L_C_D_ , we didn't need too much button too many buttons . # ID: , okay , just the decision of the power button . # ID: Should we make it a button , or some something which would be # ID: power button . # ME: I think a button . # UI: A button is better . # ME: I think it should be a bu # ID: If it if it's a button or # PM: a button , I guess so . # ME: Its own button on the front . # ID: Okay , one nice big button . # ID: Old fashioned button , to satisfy the grandmothers . # PM: So , any other suggestions or functions ? # ME: What about things like the clock and timers ? # ID: Do we still have the time ? # ID: I just wonder . # PM: , we have still one or two minutes to talk , . # ID: Oh . Well what w what was the question ? # ME: , you know , some func some features on the control to display a time , or t to display # PM: Usually it's already on T_V_ or something like that . # ID: but since we want to control all the televisions , and it would probably be worth to set the timing on the remote , Because if the T_V_ turns on itself , it well you know , if the time The timer should be there . # PM: If we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that , and is it very useful ? # PM: I mean , are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ? # PM: This is the question . # ME: Probably not . # ME: It's a questi , it's a trade-off . # PM: W In my opinion we should have only useful thing and Because apparently they want The simpler it's is better . # ID: Did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the T_V_ , well And based on your # ME: Very , okay , very occasionally . # ME: But I do use the I do use the display of the time quite often , but # ID: but it can be on the display in a corner all the time on the remote . # ME: that's okay , that's true . # ME: Okay , so no time button . Okay . # UI: And do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands , or ? # UI: I thin I think it will not take lots of place , we just need a microphone and the software , so , and it sh and it will be a little bit new and interesting , so people may be attracted to buy this stuff and it's not very difficult to put a software inside the electronic device and put a microphone . # UI: It doesn't take that much place and also that much It doesn't cost that much . # ID: but we should be careful about the battery life , then . If we use the speech recognition . # PM: So maybe we think we can think more about that , and discuss that maybe last time next time . # PM: And , now the meeting room is busy . # PM: Somebody booked the meeting room just for at one P_M_ , and so we should leave . # PM: So , . So now we are going for a small lunch . # PM: It's funded by the company . # PM: And after we have thirteen minutes to do indevel individual works . # PM: And I will do the minutes . # PM: And you are going to work on your individual works . # PM: And you will receive as usual your specific instruction and so on . # PM: Thank you everybody .
# PM: this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . # PM: the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be , but in th at the end of this meeting we have to reach a decision . # PM: we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and decisions . # PM: So , who wants to start ? # UI: you can start . # ME: Okay , I'll start . # ME: Can you open my presentation , please . # ME: I'm number four . # ME: Can you pass the mouse , please . # ME: Oh okay , that's fine . # ME: Okay . so basically I just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from looking at some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world . # ME: the fashion trends we got from talking to our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan . # ME: so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel , as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority . # ME: fancy is the , you know , highest priority . # ME: Secondly that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative . # ME: so this is t number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria . # ME: and third thirdly the easiness of use is the is important as well , but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control . # ME: From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan , we've discovered that this year fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in clothes , shoes and furniture . # ME: So , I'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category . # ME: And also the feel of material this year is expected to be spongy . # ME: so hopefully our remote control reflects that s in some way . # ID: What does it mean , spongy ? # ME: sort of squishy . # ID: Like soft , or something ? # ME: like a like a sponge . # PM: Like a sponge . # ID: Okay . I will see . # ME: so in conclusion , we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy , has lots of technolog tech technology in it . # ME: somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with a spongy feel . # ME: And that it's easy to use and from our last meeting our you know Fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of th the Real Reaction company . # PM: Easy to use , is it a as much as important than technology or fancy thing . # PM: It's less important , # ME: Less important . # ME: So fanciness first and then two ti you know , half as important as that is technology , and half important as technology is easy to use . So . # PM: So , Hamed , can you . # UI: The second one . # UI: Could you please show the presentation number three . # ID: I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature . # UI: Just Could you please check if it is the first one or the second . # UI: , n no , it's the first one . # UI: The second one . # PM: So it's not this one . # UI: Okay . So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . # UI: I think I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , but okay , we can discuss about it later . # UI: generally , generally this remote control uh should be should be something , in my opinion , the first feature is just to be easy to use . # UI: So , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in a good position uh inside the remote control . # UI: And s I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . # UI: It should be we shouldn't need to es open a t book and start reading and learning how to use this remote control . # UI: Okay . So what I found out that as I said I think it's better to put more frequent uh ke buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size . # UI: the shape of remote control should be in a way which can which should be taken easily in hand . # UI: It should not be completely like a cube . # UI: It should be it should have round edge , so then it's easier . # UI: And maybe just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand . # UI: And also f uh m because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not consume lots of energy . # UI: Okay . And my personal p preference is , as I said , just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used that much like settings button , like mobile phone . # UI: Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , so we can cover these buttons which are not used or number buttons for the for the for the can channels , and just put volume change or s ch can channel change buttons uh in the remote control . # UI: And if the user needed to do some more complex task he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this . # UI: And also I think if we put some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . # UI: Not on remote control . # UI: I dunno if I can explain well . # UI: But just inside . # UI: For example , a sliding or rolling uh d stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with thumb . # UI: So it can be another preference . # UI: And I dunno but I think usage of a speech recogn r recogniser can be good . # UI: I know that it consumes lots of energy , but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy . # UI: And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new . # UI: So it may not be very useful but because it's new , people may buy it . # UI: I personally think there should be a big difference between something . # UI: Otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from a famous company , or . # UI: Okay . That's mine . # ID: okay , so good news from me uh for me from Hamed , but bad news from Bob obviously , because spongy design , I don't like it as Okay , so could you please , Fabien , open it . # ID: I'm person two . # ID: And which one , probably the first one . # ID: I'm not sure but check the first one . # ID: I Most of the things I have to write myself on the board , but # ID: It's only this slide ? # ID: This this is just one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just I just found this , that our company developed a s a seven f seven fingers or I'll just seven inch T_ T_F_T_ screen , which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there . # ID: so I probably draw it down raw scheme . # ID: This is this is the stuff that I can use to Okay , so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view . # ID: first thing is this will be the overall shape , no I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device . # ID: So there will be some circuit for the power . # ID: So , say power circuit here . # ID: the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can uh And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can supply everything . # ID: I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just two batteries and solar cells , so . # ID: So no problem . # ID: There can be also solar cell . # ID: the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design . # ID: So at least seven to seven . # ID: It depends where you put your screen , because the screen is seven inch , so it depends on you where you put it . # ID: It doesn't matter . # ID: it's just one cord from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere . # ID: So this will be T_F_T_ . # ID: And on the main board we have the interface to the microphone , which is somewhere , say here . # ID: Interface to the microphone . # ID: Then the graphical card for the T_F_T_ and the third unit is the I_R_ . # ID: The good news is that we can we decided to use the infra-red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red , including all the stuff inside , so it will be very cheap for us . # ID: So infra-red here . # ID: once again the overall requirements , seven to seven centimetres for the board , which has to be which can be spongy but has to be this size , and the T_F_T_ which is seven inches . # ID: I have to check what I wanted to from my point of view I don't care about the about the material used for the overall des ov all the device . # PM: Can you fit any for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ? # PM: For example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , I can I can imagine it could be a problem . # ID: A all these things in this box are okay to put in any shape , basically . # ID: But we have to take care of the T_F_T_ . # ID: Well , sponginess . Maybe it a good feature , since it takes if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe , I dunno . # UI: Well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside . # PM: Maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around . # ID: Well , it's maybe related to the U_I_ . # ME: Can I ask a question . # ID: A , that's all from me . # ME: This seven inch T_F_T_ screen , how big is it in reality ? # ID: Well , seven to seven inches . # ME: That's quite big . # ME: have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen ? # PM: No , I don't think it's seven by seven , I think it's seven the diagonal is seven . # ID: To be honest , I was # PM: Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal . # ME: But I mean even that is like this big . # PM: I dunno I dun I dun One each # ID: , honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially , but it's seven inches . # ID: But I think we can we can cut it . # ME: You can cut the T_F_T_ screen . # ID: , no problem , because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth . # PM: So let's cut the T_F_T_ . # ID: , but no problem to me to cut the screen . # ID: So so for the same price we have four screens now . # PM: These technical engineers , huh . # ME: So , what's the size of the device ? # ID: well this is like this is almost nothing . # ID: Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something . # ME: Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still # ID: , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know . # ME: Can you hold that , or ? # ID: Because if it's t too small we can we can lose it , at home , you know . # PM: What user wants . # PM: He wants a small remote control , with big buttons . # ID: I thought that it should fit in the hand or something . # ME: , a small c control that they can hold in hand . # PM: It's difficult . # ME: But is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold ? # ID: I if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and you know follow Well , that's no task for me , but well seven to seven at least , # PM: So maybe you can finish your presentation , and afterwards we will discuss about all this . # PM: That's it . Okay . # PM: , so I think we have a lot We have to take decision today , so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions . # PM: first I think energy it's a key problem because it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , for example , or something like that . # PM: Because can we have L_C_D_ and speech recognition with battery , and it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device ? # ID: J just a point to the energy th things . # ID: If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_ speech recognition and L_C_D_ , so no problem in energy , I think . # ID: But we have to use the solar cell . # ID: Otherwise not . # PM: but using how many batteries , for example ? # PM: Are are what Maybe what is the size of the battery # ID: I was thinking just common A_A_ cells . # ID: So like three to five centimetres , I dunno exactly , but . # ME: So if we use s solar cells , where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside ? # ID: d doesn't need to be sun . It it's just the daylight , you know . # PM: The television lights . # ID: well I suppose that I suppose that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this , where there is light only when there are people , but . # PM: At least when there is T_V_ you can get light from the T_V_ . # ID: from the T_ I don't think it's enough , . # ID: it's a it's a compromise , no ? # PM: At least it's new and maybe technology New technology . # ID: , that's why I wanted to include the speech recognition , because you wanted all the new things . # ME: It's it's quite innovative , yes . # ME: And if you watch T_V_ outside it's very useful . # PM: So I think before talking about the other thing , it's important thing it's the case . # PM: what are gonna be the size , because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on . # PM: For example for the for the L_C_D_ , if we choose to have a small device , we cannot use this a such a screen . # ID: the s the screen is okay , but the board , that's the problem . # ID: Well what would you guess as a shape ? # ID: Or what would be the shape ? # UI: I think I think their being large or small is not important . # UI: The only important thing is to be able to take it in inside hand easily . # UI: So let's say an average size , okay , and it should not be very heavy also . # UI: And I prefer to is it shouldn't have a uniform shape , so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner , maybe . # UI: So we c it's like some joysticks . # UI: You can take some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's designed for your f taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . # UI: So the general shape should be like this . # UI: I think seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large . # UI: So seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's I think it's that's my opinion . It's easier . # ME: Which is the same area . # ME: Could you re could you redesign your board ? # ME: Oh , five centimetres by ten centimetres . # ID: , I think it's feasib Well one um How could we do it ? # ID: We could put the board next to , well , under the L_C_D_ and for example make the L_C_D_ be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand . # ID: Like holding something , and the L_C_D_ to be just on top of it , you know somehow . # ID: Well But maybe let's stick to the s spongy thing , like one unit . # PM: I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to have a smaller L_C_D_ , if it's possible . # ID: Well fi five to ten it would be feasible . # ID: Okay , so five to ten , I think it's feasible . # PM: So we are agree with a small # UI: Or or I don't know # ID: Fo Five by ten . # UI: but I don't want to now invent something new , because we didn't discuss about it . # UI: So using some L_C_D_s we can touch , so we can remove keys and just having , I dunno the name , L_C_D_ responding to fingers . # UI: Touching the screen . Something like # PM: Tactile or something , . # UI: Mm like tactile . # ME: Mm , touch screen . # PM: Touch screen , . # UI: But for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens I think we using a smaller screen is better , because # PM: The problem is we have a limit in a month of time , so we cannot do something very new . # PM: So let's go for a small L_C_D_ . # ID: Okay , so , so just give me the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me # PM: So , five by s ten . # ID: and I will work it out . # PM: so what about , so the case we talked about . # PM: something easy to use , you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ? # PM: My first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and # ID: Seven to ten banana . # ID: Rather mango or something or . # ME: Well it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company . # ME: I mean what other what other fruit and vegetables # PM: But it's just an idea . # PM: I dunno what you think about , but # ME: Do you know of any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow ? # PM: I dunno if it can fit with the technology . # PM: You are the specialists of that . # ID: You mean banana . # ID: Well , but If it's If it If the banana is big enough . # ID: But if you want to look at the screen , no . # UI: I think this is not good . # PM: The screen has to be square ? # PM: Or it can be like a shape , quite , with curves . # ID: Well , it can be whatever you want . # ID: But if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . # ID: But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so . # ID: It's like more expensive to have shape like that . # ID: But I don't care . You know , if we fit this requirement . # ME: I'd like a shaped screen . # ME: I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on the T_F_T_ screen . # ID: , m maybe the banana could be like a bit fatter than the c common one . # PM: , it should remember banana , but it's not doesn't have to b to be uh really the size and exactly the shape of a banana . # ID: Like modified banana , okay . # PM: So we are agree with the banana thing ? # ID: Well it we'll stick to banana , or ? # ME: , banana's good . # PM: So , the last point we decided it's infra-red , I guess . # UI: , I think infra-red . # PM: Everybody's agreed . # PM: , so that's it I think about the concepts . # PM: You have other thing to add to this point , or no ? # PM: So , about the user interface , so we are going to use L_C_D_ . # PM: In the last meeting we talked about hidden buttons . # PM: I don't know what we are going to do with that . # PM: You talked about the buttons on the side # ID: Like like peeling of the banana you s # UI: , peeling of the banana . # ID: It would be cool , . # ID: Peeling of the banana , you know , should discover the other buttons , which are hidden . # PM: And you mean the first layer would be spongy . # ID: First layer obviously spo , w It's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , I think . # PM: Is it is it possible to do that ? # PM: It would be a great idea , but is it possible technically ? # PM: Like doing a spongy layer of the banana , and you open it . # ME: I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that , you know , to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and # UI: Something like a plastic cover covering some interface , U_S_B_ interface as in the in digital camera . # UI: If you see it's like peeling . You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some interfaces for adaptor . # UI: So keys can be buttons can be covered like this , with a plastic cover and when and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana . # UI: So , something like this . # PM: , but do you see that as a rigid thing , or like a banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or . # ID: Well is it possible to make it soft ? # UI: , it's a lic like a plastic cover , so . # ID: So I think if it's so then it's cool ? # PM: So , I dunno what you think , Bob , but it would be great for users I think , and very good for marketing . # ME: I think for sure . Definitely . The softer the better . # ID: Honestly speaking , I cannot imagine it , so far , but it will be terrible . # PM: And setting buttons hidden in . # PM: Mm , other remarks , or something , or . # PM: Something we didn't talk about yes yet , or . # PM: I think we are almost there . # PM: maybe , how can we , if we have a soft thing , like this , and to open it we have to attach it somewhere , I dunno how to do that technically , or . # ME: We could use Velcro . # ME: Or ma maybe a magnetic # UI: Yes , it's a good idea . # PM: Ma magnetic oh . # UI: Mm . or a it can is it can be a plastic cover sticking to the to the all the stuff like with magnetic p magnetic materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely . # UI: And when you try to open it , it will be opened easily . # UI: So you can be sure that it will not be open while you're while you are commonly using buttons on the banana . # PM: And what would be the matter here of the first layer I mean ? # PM: Mm . Likes . Soft plastic , or # ME: , I imagine some sort of vinyl thing . # ME: In a in a sort of a with a suede sort of feel . Maybe . # ID: Well since the since the things like the like the screen and how to say that , solar cell has to be has to be like kept in the shape , we cannot b So we need that the that the peeling I dunno but we should we should take care of these two things . # ID: So , if the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed , then the material must be able to put the light inside , you know . # ID: So that we can reach the energy out of it out of that . # ME: Mm . So you're saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and # ID: It is possible , but , well if it # ME: And a and a banana . # ID: I dunno how to how to do it if t if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it , or inside . # ID: But then it must be some window there , you know . # PM: And something we forgot , maybe , about the speech recognition system , are we going to use it , or not ? # UI: Yes , I think . I think so . # ME: I think it's important . # PM: It i , it seems feasible , and it would be something very great . # ME: I think One of our p priorities is tech technology . # PM: So we have the de design , the a good shape , new and so on , and we have also the technology thing w will be . # PM: And even the easy to use thing , so it will be perfect . # PM: So we add also the speech recognition device . # PM: So , that great . # PM: We have decided everything . # PM: And think we are on a good way . # PM: So , the next meeting will start in thirty minutes . # PM: , so the Industrial Manager will work on the look and feel design . # PM: The User Interface uh Mana Manager will work on the user interface device . # PM: And the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation . # PM: So , I hope you can do that in thirty minutes . # PM: I think you should work together , s you Hamed and Peter , to work in a in a first prototype , and more about the shape and so on and how you can manage to put everything together . # PM: And as usual you will receive some specific instructions on . # PM: So thank you all everybody , and see you in thirty minutes .
# PM: So , hello everyone . # PM: We're here to have a kick-off meeting for the design of a f for the beginning of new project remote control for the design for a new remote control . # PM: I'm the Project Manager Christa Pavlov and okay let's begin . # PM: I'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan , some discussion and then we talk of the next meeting . # PM: So we want to do a new remote control . # PM: It has to be original , trendy and user friendly . # PM: I think the important points we have to t talk about are it's functional design , it's conceptual design , and desail detailed design . # PM: and for that we're going all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day . # PM: , so let's try the whiteboard . # PM: so any of you who want to go . # UI: , for favourite animals . # UI: It's gonna be not my favourite one but the one I can draw . # UI: And it's gonna be you'll try to guess . # UI: Yes , that's a rabbit . # UI: That's my favourite one . # ME: A r a rabbit , oh , where is the carrot ? # PM: You want to go ? # ME: I am not very good at this kind of stuff . # ME: My favourite animal is # ME: It's a very complex animal Characteristics of this animal is dangerous . # PM: Mm I think you're supposed to , . # ID: Is the white I guess you can . # ME: , a kind of snake ? # UI: No , it just small cobra , . # PM: Is that a worm ? Or # UI: It's co c quite recognisable . # ME: What about you # PM: Christa Pavlov Mm . # PM: Smiling fish . # ME: A smiling fish . # ME: So , w whiteboard is working ? # PM: Let's talk about money . # UI: Just tr try to guess who is a User Interface Designer . # UI: According to the drawings . # ME: So . Twenty five Euro for a remote control . # PM: mm that's the price we want to that's the aim for the price for the remote control . # PM: We aim to do this profit . # UI: On the international market . # ME: 'tis big number . # ID: , we're to sell two million then . # PM: Mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum . # PM: So any of you have experience in remote controls ? # ME: yes , we have plenty at home . # ME: In fact , my daughter likes l remote controls . # ME: To eat ? , mainly , and to break . # PM: So that could be a great application . # PM: Remote controls children proof . # UI: Children proof . # ME: So she likes buttons which make click , so it has to click . # PM: So they have to be waterproof maybe ? # ME: It has to be wha baby proof # PM: 'Cause they eat she ate it . # ME: but mainly it has to be very robust because even if she's not very tall she's high enough so that when she throw it away it's So it has to be very robust . # UI: Okay , unbreakable . # ME: Unbreakable , . # ID: , we have some child lock or something , . # ME: it has to be nice looking , colourful , maybe # PM: Colourful , mm . # UI: Colourful ? That's not practical . # ME: colourful , because nobody has colourful remote control # PM: No , that's a good idea . # ID: , it's always black or . # ME: they're always black , # ME: but this one could be I dunno , purple or b # UI: But how gonna just but it's monochrome it's n it's not like # PM: because you think , why not . # UI: Otherwise you will never find it . # ID: even we can change colours , no ? # ME: Oh like the phones , # ID: like the phones and these things we c . # ME: , it could change colours , . # ID: At least for children like one colour and . # ID: And it should be really small and . # PM: Don't you think # ID: Huh not so big like . # PM: No , not too much buttons or mm . # ID: , not too much buttons and # ME: Should it be , y you know these remote controls where they are what they call a universal ret remote control so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television , then it's the remote control for the sound system , or for your refrigerator whatever I dunno if it's Or if we should have a targeted re remote control . # ME: So colour , robustness , easy to use , size , # PM: So , I think there's # ME: , size matters , . # ID: . Colour , size , sh # PM: So you think it's better if small than bigger . # ID: , maybe at least n not bigger than this I guess . # UI: , but without any extremes like n not of this size , not too large . Okay . # PM: No , not too small , . # ID: at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like . # UI: , like a palm sized . # UI: Just to hold it . # ME: But what would be different from this , from the others ? # ID: maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame . # ID: Mm . S so then it depends # ME: , at least the colour would be different . # ID: you are to Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame . # ME: I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place . # ME: For some reason they click the off button when they want to use the So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow , # PM: Mm . So , some kind of idea with um cellular phone with a screen that will tell you what # UI: no screens , it's too complex . # ID: Mm . Too expensive , . # ME: Too expensive for twelve Euro ? # UI: And n maybe not too expensive , # PM: And too expensive . # UI: well it's not my problem , but well okay . # UI: But no screens on remote controls . # ME: I thought it could be only a screen which would change depending on uh the use or even the user . # ME: So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right , so I would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a full touch screen remote control , if you if you like . # ID: I mean it it's like # ME: I don't know if it makes sense , but # ID: it's like two types no ? # ID: people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this , say if you're right handed you use like this # ME: , for instance , mm . # ID: or so tha your switch on and off should be on # PM: So adaptable something # UI: Adaptable . Alright , good , # ME: Maybe , if it's possible , . # UI: so how many actions do we need to implement in it ? # ID: Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can only make one working . # ID: We can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations . # UI: I mean if it's less than three then we can make it like a # ME: Three buttons you mean ? # UI: like three mental states , # PM: Three option . # UI: you know what I mean , we can just make it controlled by a brain , huh ? # PM: Maybe if it's more , if there is a software inside that ask you three If it if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye . # ME: more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time . # UI: But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else . # ME: but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five . # ME: And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five . # UI: I usually just change channels . # ME: Because I'm only using three or four channels but # ID: But they keep generally their t slash this thing and then the dash and then you can put , you can only have one bit . # PM: I change channel like this , m I want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , uh-huh mm . # ME: And then back to the one I was before , # PM: Also we can be here # ME: so there's whichever it was . # PM: , that would be cool . # UI: Go back button is good . # ME: we had that in other countries . # ID: , the previous button is . # ME: e even the history so you could like undo previous of the previous . # ME: Then you can watch what your you could also record your record your sequence of actions , that becomes more complex , but you could look at what the other people have used there or remote controls . # ID: , what the which channels the viewer # PM: So I think we have full of idea . # PM: we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and I want you to mm work on these ideas and try to make a the ones , make to decide what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want . # PM: And m maybe more in the technical parts what do we want to do . # PM: So your personal coach will send you some instruction for this thirty minutes . # ME: So what does M_E_ means ? # ME: M_E_ the user requirements ? # ME: Or that's for us ? # UI: Market Expert . # ME: Oh , of course , the user requirement specifications , Okay . I'll think of that . # PM: I think that's all . # ME: Meeting's over ? # PM: See you in thirty minutes . # UI: Thank you everybody .
# PM: I hope you're ready for this functional design meeting . # PM: I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation . # PM: we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement we need to know the user needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work third part I don't remember which is not very good . # PM: of course , how to design this # PM: let's go for the three presentations , so first Marketing Expert . # PM: So wait a minute . Mm . # ME: So I dunno if I can do that like this ? # ME: it's being modified . # ME: Do you want , open . Read only . # ME: I hope I saved it . # UI: Sammy Benjo . I know this name . # ME: this is my name . # UI: We met before . # ME: So as you know , you I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . # ME: I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people s want and like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to design it correctly . # ID: it is put F_ five . # ID: The full page presentation , # ME: maybe in the full page # ME: because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so . # ME: So basically what I suggest is that instead of deciding ourself what could be and what should be a good remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and what they do with them by the way because they are supposed to be useful . # ME: Don't forget about that . # ME: So we've conducted a survey on the use of remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey . # ME: And next please . # ME: , so basically what we found was that there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls . # ME: First of all , they find it very ugly . # ME: Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking . # ME: what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that . # ME: And the other thing is that the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it the current facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . # ME: For instance we see that they zap very often so I think this is a very important functionality that it should be easy for them to zap in one way or another . # ME: And most of the buttons on current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . # ME: people are very frustrated w with their remote controls and they for instance they don't even find it it's often lost somewhere in the in the in your home and nobody knows where it is . # ME: Maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please , where are you ? # ME: Like something to like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . # ME: of course phone you can always phone your phone but you can't phone your remote control . # ID: You can you are . # ME: And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use , in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the people say they don't know how to they to use properly their r remote controls . # ME: And they are bad for R_S_I_ but I don't remember what is R_S_I_ . # PM: Okay tha that's look great . # ME: So I think they are bad . # ME: nobody has any idea about that ? # ME: Well I'll check with my # ID: , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe effect . # UI: No , I don't think so . # ME: I think it's a technical thing which our # ID: because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology , and those waves have high # ME: it seems that it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know # UI: But twenty six percent , do you know # PM: Or something we don't know . # ME: but we have to take this into account . # UI: Every fourth , you know . Every four some of us knows . # ID: it's People really # ME: that's for what the biggest frustration of the user what else do I have ? # ME: So we've listed a couple of # ME: s functions that may be used by u the user in the current available remote controls and well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session , but it is very relevant . # ME: People want to have a power button . # ME: Channel selection is o often used very often used and indeed very relevant . # ME: now I remember what is R_S_I_ it's repetitivity stress injury . # ME: We have to be careful with that word but anyway I continue my presentation channel selection is very important , very often used . # ME: Volume is not often used but people want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course . # ME: And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . # ME: All of them . they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . # ME: It seems that people find teletext relevant , even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least , so . # PM: I have been told that we don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet . # ME: I can tell you that in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as these two one were had I think ten I think . # ME: But but if you compare with these ones , I think they scored a one or two . # ME: Not very relevant , so if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant . # ME: That's for the main functions I think and then we can ask ourself what people don't have that may be useful . # ME: For instance I think net next slide . # ME: One of the thing the trend that you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . # ME: So we've conducted a survey about whether people would like or not to have this kind of functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . # ME: Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant . # ME: And as the age goes up the relevance goes down . # ME: So now it really depends on the kind of targeting wha who are we targeting with this remote control ? # ME: I think if we are targeting young people then it's probably something we have to consider . # ME: If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they this should be # ME: this is of course , depends on that . # ME: And I don't have any conclusion , I didn't have time the meeting was very tight , so that's basically my findings . # ME: if you have any question ? # PM: Mm I think it's good , okay . You done a good review . # UI: I got one question , # ME: one question , # UI: you are a Market Expert should we aim at the young people or not ? # ME: I think we should aim at the young people . # ME: But I think they are they are those who might be more interested in a in a new device . # ME: In general the early adopters of a new device are young people , less than more than # UI: then teletext is used less . # ME: Then teletext is useless for them I think , Because they have other means of finding their information . # PM: That's good point . # PM: now I think it's the turn of the I'm not sure Of the technical function , # ME: So I think it's you , huh ? # ID: techni function of # ME: user requiremen # PM: Wait a second . # ID: I have to do working design so # UI: That's but this but number three , my name is Mark Dwight , and I am responsible for User Interface Design . # UI: However , mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design . # UI: , as I'm a more an artist that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this . # UI: So next slide please . # UI: And a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task is not to forget about Occam razor . # UI: We should never complicate things too much . # UI: We should only make a remote control , nothing more . Nothing more than this , just a remote control . # UI: 'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use . # UI: So , make a click , please . # UI: So here is this remote control . # UI: It's quite a standard one , but it's not from a T_V_ , it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something . # UI: But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily . # UI: Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , and please make a click , compared to this one which one would you prefer ? # ME: I would say the simplest one as long as there are the I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button . # ID: Maybe it can be middle of like , between those two # UI: and our method is going to be , provide simple # UI: simple desires into simple actions . # ME: Nice . Nice sentence . # UI: Our question of the style , we should remember that our company puts fashion into electronics and we should never forget about it . # UI: Be simple . Be simple and you'll lean on this market . # UI: Market is a of remote controls you know it better , it's very it's not an easy field to play , you know ? # UI: For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium . # UI: It's a really good style , it going to be look like this . # UI: It is unbreakable and it is very universal . # UI: W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours , and we can put all the options into this screen . # UI: We'll need only few buttons . # UI: All the other things can be controlled through the screen . # UI: And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch . # UI: I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium I think , and what else ? # UI: I got just very few and good ideas . # UI: We need power and volume . # UI: And let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . # UI: When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the T_V_ , # UI: the T_V_ turns on . # ME: And when does it turn off ? # UI: When you don't touch the control but you go out of the For for enough time # ME: sensing sensor machine that knows # UI: It's a question to our technical design , our two engineers . # UI: And another nice feature that I would like to implement is volume control . # UI: Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you . # UI: Like , you want to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes . # PM: Or you want to go to the kitchen . # UI: It's easy to do , you just control the # ME: According to your distance to and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system . # UI: According to the distance . # ME: I'm not sure about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? # ME: is it a touch screen by the way ? # UI: I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter . # ME: So it gives instructions but it has to be with an back light somehow . # UI: its main purpose in fact is a back light , which change colours , which makes it easier to find , and each can it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily , So basically that's it . # PM: I see that you target several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about universal remote control . # UI: Can be easily done , you got simple designs , we should put it to simple actions . # UI: Let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi-fi system . # UI: You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume . # UI: Just few actions , a few actions for everything . # UI: All the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen . # PM: Since we were targeting a really soon uh date for the i issuing of this remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised . # UI: but it's quite universal you know . # UI: We can just extend it to any device . # ME: for instance if I want to go to directly to channel twenty five , how would I do can I do that with this ? # ME: mm let's say I am on channel eight now . # ME: You know these days we have hundreds of channels , that's not so easy to go just next when you have hundreds of channels . # UI: In fact I would propose another solution . # UI: Basically you use just four or five channels , # UI: set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel . # ME: In fact in one remote control that I've seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button . # PM: it's the same solution , I think . # ID: But even we can have some L_C_D_ display , like you can de you can just button the number # ME: Go to channel twenty five . # ID: and then it go # ME: One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap . # ME: So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels , # ME: just because this is one kind of thing they do , zapping . # PM: on zap it's only next , . # ME: And it's only next . # UI: Mm . We got these buttons here . Next next . # ME: so but you have to # UI: Or say this can be back . # ID: But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five # ME: So it would be # PM: Maybe we can make different modes for each button and you can change mode zapping mode or # PM: current chan # ID: but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls # ME: Listening more . # ID: so we can have more functions for T_V_ if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices . # UI: Could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ? # ME: I could have a look at that maybe . # ME: I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that . # ME: Although I don't know . # UI: Thanks for your attention . # PM: you're finish ? # PM: So now the technical aspects of this new device . # PM: You prefer it . # ID: as you know , I am mister Ramaro . # ID: I am an expert in industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many like digital calculators and electronic calculators . # ID: So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . # ID: as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera . # ID: So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the main device like T_V_ . # ID: So we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . # ID: And usually this so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . # ID: And then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device . # ID: It's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . # ID: Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . # ID: basically we need since we are focusing on our interface device remote control mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like the keypad and you know buttons we want , and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are I am one doing mostly digital devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format . # ID: And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device . # ID: Then we'll have switch in our main device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s , so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s channel changing and these things . # PM: To make it quite an universal device . # ID: because the people don't use one particular brand so or at least we have more than five brands , which are really good . # ID: So we need to check their specifications and do their encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device . # ID: So we need to have particular encryption codes . # ID: Then , components , so we have the main energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared source and then we have some inside some chip in the device . # ID: since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components . # ID: And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface , so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them . # PM: And from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard , or mm . # ID: , I'm sure , because since our User Interface speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy , we can have another , like s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip . # ID: Since we have some kind of energy this is our this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put the small simple speech recogniser and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just # PM: train it , okay . # ID: so that we just use simple recog # ME: But very good to sell . # ID: even in you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , . # ME: Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , and ha you cannot use my remote control , because it's targeted to me . Whatever . # PM: And what about the price of this component ? # ID: maybe we can make it in five Euros and even less than that , because we want to have millions and in bulk , # ID: so we can make really simp and we want to make really simple device because we have only very few words like power , switch on or some like then we'll have something like this we'll have volume and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen . # ME: The user will just be able to say please can you pump up the vo pump up the volume or it will be something like volume , up , down . # ID: a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt volume and then # PM: With a keywords and . # ID: volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words and because we can't really say user to say same wording # ME: Couple of words . # ID: then it become more mechanical and . # ID: And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , because we don't know like users have different programmes , I mean they don't really follow same channels strict so we just want channel number , we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else # ME: Of course it has to be # ID: because it will be complicated so we'll have only these three main basic anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem , it's it will be take care of our main mm . # UI: No you know it's a conceptual question , 'cause now I see th this the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up , # ME: But then I think you # UI: and he's coming you know , he's really annoyed with this , down , up , down . # ME: First of all I think this is not functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons . # PM: No , in no not only speech , . # ME: It's on top of using the button . # PM: I it's an option . # UI: for this budget like twelve Euros . # ID: actually we can have one switch to like switch on , on and off , this processor and This really , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this D_S_P_s . # ID: Again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and like this key . # ID: So it may not be like very expensive , because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control and we have only few things here # PM: Sho to train , okay . # UI: Did you consider the r gest gesture recognition ? # UI: Like , if I want to put volume up I like do mm I take my remote control do like something like roll 'em up # ID: uh this point we didn't consider # UI: or roll 'em down . # ME: Very expensive , # ID: because it's very expensive because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros # PM: And well , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , . # ME: And volume control . # ID: even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really they just they don't touch the remote and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off # ME: Sh should we target a user personalised uh remote control ? # ME: So in a given room there might be more than one remote control . # ME: We would have each one and with our own personal settings . # ID: that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay after one hour I # PM: Wouldn't that make arguments ? # ID: They can make # ME: That's no problem , we will sell more . # PM: And we can increase this the strength # UI: We got a really good Market Expert . # PM: y you can buy one with # UI: Let's send more , let's sell more . # PM: You have mm something else to say ? . # ID: not very much , # ID: Thank you . Yep . # PM: mm I think , okay , we're just on time . # PM: mm . So , we're now going to l have the lunch break . # PM: Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and we will meet again for the next meeting , and in this one want to be more focused on the individual actions the on the components you will focus on the component concept of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be focused on the user interface concept # PM: and our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo on the trend watching . # PM: of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal coach . # PM: I think that's all . # PM: And we have maybe we have to we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ? # PM: I think automatic on off control it's not possible . # ID: it's in current price , . # PM: maybe in the next step if we make it work . # ID: But speech recogniser can be possible . # PM: , implemented . # PM: we can think about that . # PM: do you see something else ? # UI: , should it be equipped with the , with speakers ? # ME: Speakers in the remote cont # UI: Like , you want to find it , you shout control , and it answers is I'm here ? Or # ME: It just beeps . # ME: That would be enough . # PM: Or maybe you want to phone him . # ME: Something very cheap . # PM: Since now all # ME: But that's ex that's expensive . # ID: especially the power , it really consumes because it should be all the time on # ME: I heard of devices where you just whistle them and they # PM: And it's answered . # ME: because of the frequency they just answer to that . # UI: I can't whistle . # ME: You can't whistle . # ME: You can clap . Can you ? # PM: Clap clap it's a good # PM: I think it's universal . # PM: What about people without hand ? # ME: Just a suggestion . # ID: I think it's good . # ME: With only one hand ? # ME: These are not our target people . # ID: But it's a good feature I guess we need to think about more how to incorporate it . # UI: Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping . # ME: that's e that already exists # UI: I got it at my home , like . # ME: Oh , you do have . # ME: Wow . You're trendy . # PM: let's to think s so that # ME: Think about it . # PM: I think that could be in the component concept . # PM: let's go to lunch . # ID: Thank you , thank you very much .
# PM: Okay , so now we are on the conceptual design meeting . # PM: y getting close to the last is the penultim meeting . # UI: How was lunch ? # ME: Thanks Don't be sarcastic . Mark . # PM: I will again do the secretary part we will have three presentation first the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy . # PM: we have to take a decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes . # PM: what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case . # PM: And also on user interface concept what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . # PM: And at the end Sammy will give a trend watching on what he's been doing . # PM: First with Rama . # PM: Participant two . # ID: , participant two . # ID: we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . # ID: For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . # ID: First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use traditional solar cells mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_ and then titanium , which can be which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . # ID: And we can use some , moving kind of thing . # ID: as we discussed before , we need to we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . # ID: this can be simple kind of programmable chip which can use microphone sensors . # ID: And we also want to look at our remote control , Still we are looking for possible technical specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to in our twelve Euros or around that . # ID: So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house . # ID: we discussed an Excuse me . # ID: we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic to have enough energy with the solar cells and so we would like to just use simple battery . # ID: And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes . # ME: What is a double-curved shape ? # ID: Like you can have two curves . # ID: it's I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic . # ID: we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_ which are which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive , since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition we want to reduce cost . # PM: I want to know why it b just sorry but for the point before why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light . # ID: And also like in if you put a it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things # PM: You m titanium it's more # UI: W we can use something like you know the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts # UI: to make it feel better you know # ID: Like in cell phones recently these you can with the rubber in four directions and But full assembly We'll use mainly for titanium rubber is expensive and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes . # ID: And this push buttons we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money # PM: Okay , s so simple button and speech recognition for the more complicated . # ID: Y we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , # UI: and still we have mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ? # ME: Seems not , it's either L_C_D_ or push-button . # UI: it's not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus . # ID: maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and # UI: so let's try it , # ID: because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or something so we want to reduce the cost on display # ME: The L_C_D_ would # ID: or this inter # ME: The display would only be display and not touch sensitive you mean . # UI: it's not gonna be a touch pad , just a display for giving you information . # ME: Just for output , # ID: Ok , that can we can consider , because like it won't take much money I guess , because Okay , yep . # ID: You have any further questions # ME: I guess no the batteries are going to be very light . # ID: we're to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries for really light batteries and with good price . # ME: this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just be ask . # ID: then the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it will be it m maybe at least five , six people want to use it so how to uh how to define our re speech recognition whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent . # ID: If we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology # PM: for the location . # ID: if everybody in the house n to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something . # PM: Okay . So let's now go to the you don't have more question ? # PM: mm thank you mm . # UI: No more questions . # ME: Puts less of constraint on what we can do it's always like that . # ME: We have dreams and the in the end we find out that it's not feasible . # ID: Oh . We have some limitations . # UI: But still L_S_D_'s already quite nice , # ME: L_S_D_ is something else , and it's quite nice as well . # UI: I'm an artist , that's not # UI: I hope that's not too much . # PM: Now let's talk about interface . # UI: participant number three . # UI: mm have a look at this the concept of the interface . # UI: Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user's manual and all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls . # UI: So let's start with this . # UI: We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons and we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here and go back button , I don't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , and power on and off mm I don't remember it should be maybe this button is power on and off ? # UI: I can see nothing . # UI: that's our concept . # UI: It's called the millennium remote control . # ME: Let's change millenniums . # ID: maybe you can use in the end and # ME: doesn't make sense . # ME: This is very ugly . # UI: I thought you like it . # UI: just press the button , please . # ME: too much concept . # UI: we will not use this . We will not use this . # UI: But instead of this I will devise That's our concept . # UI: And it's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already we already discussed . # UI: And what will people say ? # UI: They'll say it's perfect . # UI: Or what will say ? # UI: they will say it's splendid . # UI: And e everyone will say I'll buy it . # ME: Do you think it can come in several colours ? # UI: And everyone's gonna be satisfied . # UI: I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours . # ME: but not the case . # ME: the case would only be in that aluminium titanium stuff , # PM: Because apparently from your survey people like colours , # ME: they like something which is # UI: Okay , so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels . # UI: Do you like it ? # ME: so that would be the option . I don't know I don't have a Nokia phone , # ME: I don't use that but again , I might # UI: That's why you don't have it . That's why , 'cause it's nasty . # ID: But it would be expensive , no ? If you use colour L_C_D_ . # ID: instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler . # ID: Maybe we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this the shapes and they can have different assembly . # ID: So users have different I mean they have their own interests , colour interests and so So we can just if they want they can just pay another two Euro . # PM: Uh-huh , okay , you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on L_C_D_ , # ID: If they want like so that we can # ME: Kind of upgradable remote control . # ID: Just they'll get few more things and few more colours . # UI: there's one more decisi one more solution in fact , 'cause there are some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature , # PM: And thermodynamic also . # ME: Like a chameleon . # UI: We can make it in fact . # PM: but that's maybe mo too much expensive , . # PM: But it can be in maybe in an a gradable version , # ME: Because I think there are two kinds of people . # ME: Those for which the remote control is to be something useful I'm going to talk about this later and those for which is something that is specific to them so it it's like a signature . # ME: My remote control is pink . # ME: Nobody else than me has a pink remote control . # ME: And that makes me special . # PM: and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more because of o or this is # ME: I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that . # ME: Those who wanted to have it pink . # PM: it's not a s base service # ME: It might be optional , . # ID: But those people will be really few , So like we can those # ME: The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends . # ME: Although similar but have something just slightly better . Pink # PM: maybe that's if that it's a selling point maybe it has to be the base . # UI: But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time . # PM: And you'll be different . # UI: And it makes you different , you know ? # ME: You always have your remote . # PM: in the train , hello no . Want to change my neighbour . # UI: Anyone has their remote controls here ? # ME: Oh , you don't ? . You don't have your remo you know like for instance take the iPod . It's a kind of remote control . # ME: it's white and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere . # ME: It has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like just because it's a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control . White . # UI: Could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ? # ME: Seems important . # UI: That they can use it in darkness , like . Hand light , # ME: Mm glow in the dark , # ID: maybe like the infrared like we can put some radium chips or something so that like at least # UI: Okay . S well , let's go on maybe with the presentation . # UI: And the remote control's going to be smart but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ? # UI: I dunno that's a question to you and to mm to # ME: Well so I heard that it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done so that's the smartness of the thing . # ME: Currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or beer cans with speech recognition but we may have remote controls with speech recognition . # PM: Mm , that's a nice world . # UI: So just think about it . # ME: Don't touch the remote . # ME: Are are you saying here that the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? # ME: for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want . # UI: I just want to say it should be real smart . # ME: Like with some Maybe fingerprint recognition or # UI: Voice recognition is quite tough . # UI: I say don't use it , and the control just looks . # UI: 'Cause I ordered jus To l to l lock it . # ID: that mm that could be feasible I guess , since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition so we can use # ME: So it could be smart in that way . # ME: But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other uh particularity that the remote control could have . # ME: S since it knows who is using it , it might also record the kind of channels you are u more often using and levels of volumes that you're more often things like that and provide you ways of using them , I dunno , somehow , I dunno , that might be expensive that might also be a good sales pitch again . # ME: The remote that knows you . # PM: , Marketing Expert . # PM: Participant two ? # ME: Okay , so I'm going to talk about trends and I hope this can help us to understand l how we should design our remote control . # ME: next slide please . # ME: first maybe just a small recap on how do we watch trends it's not so simple you might think that it's easy but it's not so simple . # ME: Anyway these days the best source of information is the web as you know , so have to go often on the web and look at what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people have with them , always , like a phone . # ME: We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh example of where to in be inspired . # ME: Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends , they're inventing it , they're creating the trend . # ME: I hope I'm going to try to help you on that . # ME: This is more risky because you're not following the trend , you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business . # ME: So anyway next slide please . # ME: to be to be quick there's a lot of words here but basically there are in the market of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to . # ME: The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . # ME: And interestingly this is the very most important thing . It has to be fancy . # ME: Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative , it has to be new with some of new technology inside and this is also more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . # ME: So as you see it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of uh that i they can be id identified with and then something that contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours . # ME: And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control . # ME: Next slide please . # ME: and now in a more general uh broad way of seeing th the thing . # ME: If we look back and not look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas currently the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have a fruit and vegetable way of look or feel And I think of course i it applies to everything . # ME: That's the thing with trends . # ME: It it can travel f from clothe to furniture same idea . # ME: Fruit and vegetable . Think fruit and vegetable . # ME: And if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy , # UI: What is spongy ? # ME: this so I think uh i # ID: kind of maybe # ME: When we were talking about rubber , I think the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess . # PM: So maybe titanium it's not a good idea . # ID: We need to think about mm . # ME: Seems not , seems not . # PM: It seems to be # ME: Think more of something in the colours of like fruit and vegetables and spongy , # ME: even in the shape it has to be more round and more uh look natural somehow . I mean And not those futuristic remote control with angles and titanium like . # PM: You're old-fashioned . # ME: that's what people seem to i I know it's quite far from what you thought but that's fashion that's all I have to say . # PM: Mm you have questions ? # ID: these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? # ME: These I'm sorry . # ID: This you so did you # ME: we have people uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course , as you know our company is quite big and so I'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask their friends # ME: that are also # ID: It's more general trend it's not particular to the remote control . # ME: No , it's not it's not this is very general , . # ME: But it seems that trends travel across things . # ID: but some materials n they're to be they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy # ME: We have to I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables # ID: sponge , at least that's # ME: but we still have to put our chips inside , so of course . # ME: This is your problem . # ME: This is not mine . # ID: looking fruit . These things can be easily incorporated . # ID: We can have t colours or this shape # ME: I think in the colours and in the kind of material . # ME: If if it's something like rubber made or I think it it's also going to be good . # PM: No more question ? # PM: Okay , so we will have next meeting in thirty minutes again . # PM: now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama wil design , # ID: Look and feel de # PM: Mark the user interface design , and Sammy the product evaluation . # PM: you will work together on a new on a prototype using modelling clay . # ID: Mm sounds interesting . # PM: and I as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction . # ID: can we highlight the specific features of our # PM: you're right , you have to # ID: we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , # ID: we want to follow general trend . # PM: do we agree on that ? # ME: No , we don't have to , # ME: but seems it's the trend . # ME: Again , as I said we can also try to make it , to create the trend . # UI: are we confident enough on creating trends ? # ME: So there's no you t can try to convince us . # UI: we can make it smell like fruit . # ME: Okay . that's a good idea , # PM: Okay , that's a good idea . # PM: So titanium smell like fruit . # ID: what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ? # ID: Or they really like They more want these fancy features # ME: I think i it's again in this what I said first it has to be fancy so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us # ME: because we have it and others don't . # ME: Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important . # PM: I agree with this Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . # PM: Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy fruity-like # ID: we will try to explore these two options # ME: Maybe you could explore the two option . # UI: Could we make a titanium shape ? I mean fruit-shaped . # ID: at least like we can make banana # PM: Don't you say that you cannot do double shape curved shape # UI: Doub double-curved . # ME: Mm . Seems to be . # ID: that's a we're to look for and s we're to see the whether rubber is expensive # UI: In fact I just agreed to make to make the like titanium panels on a whole rubber body . # UI: Well , okay w we'll see . # PM: you explore now that you're going to work together these two . # PM: Or or spongy an # ID: Maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium . # ID: we have only the plastic or the chippy fibre chips or # UI: We'll see . We'll see . # ME: If you have time . # PM: I don't think w I think we have to choose . # PM: If we choose titanium or if we choose spongy but it cannot be both . # UI: I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some for # ME: For creation . # UI: I dunno we'll look . # PM: you can pretend that it's titanium . # ME: You can paint it afterward . # ME: We have a very large department of paint . # PM: do don't worry , you speak with mm . # ME: You will do it . # UI: Alright , alright . # PM: Okay . So explore a shape . # ID: still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or # PM: Mm I think it's what we say , that we have an L_C_D_ with information . # ME: The thing is that if we want to have as he says if we want to have a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are . # ID: then we can that user friendly # ME: That's the converse to having zillions of button where each button does only one thing . # ID: and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or # ME: Classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent the wheel . # ME: Anyway it's very in general I think people change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control . # ME: Because the trend goes faster than the life of the So it's very # PM: So see you in thirty minutes .
# PM: it's the Hi Sammy . # PM: It's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . # PM: So , first Mark and Rama are going to present the prototype . # PM: then Sammy will propose some crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . # PM: Then , w we And then we going to do some finance to see if it is feasible # UI: And chocolate ? # PM: and at the end we will we will evaluate ourself as a team . # PM: And that's all . # PM: Okay . So first , let's see the prototype . # ID: , here we have our prototype model . # PM: Okay . And you have some slides then ? # ID: , we have also some slides . # UI: Yes , and place some slides . # UI: , participant three . Prototype . # UI: this is our remote control . # UI: It's a r working prototype . # UI: You can use it now by switching all these buttons . # UI: So first , I present as we came to this perfect model , and then we'll give some technical specifications . # UI: That's well , so that's that . # UI: Please , next slide . # UI: We analysed all the fruits and contacted NASA , and made some real good If you can see this , and the stars are showing that . And , s society will accept that . For sure . # UI: And making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and ultimate smell of it . # UI: S please , next slide . # UI: But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea , 'cause it's the most of the moder the m the modern material we can p select . And it's practical . And it's still say it's for our needs , so please press something . # UI: And as I said , it's perfect . # UI: Please press it . # ID: Experience . Explanat # UI: Everyone is f really glad to obtain an s such a r such a device . # ME: Such a nice thing . # UI: So you can touch it with your hands . # ME: imitating flatulence] # PM: What do you say ? # UI: You must say it . # ME: If I if I need so . # ME: Hopefully my daughter will like it . # UI: Y and we got the answer . # UI: , it is , yes , of course . # ME: Yes , of course . Of c course . # UI: , please next slide . # UI: , this is a prototype . # UI: You can have a look at it , and That's all I wanted to say . # UI: Now it's technical specification by our colleague . # ME: Oh , there is a button missing . # ID: This this is really flexible . # ID: You can add your buttons . # ME: It's in option . # ID: So function , mm So , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . # ID: And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . # ID: Then you ha you'll have volume control . # ID: So , you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume . # ID: And we have some L_C_D_ controls . Like , m switching the L_C_D_ display if you want to use L_C_D_ , or you don't want you can just use normal button . # ID: And we have speech recognition . # ID: Here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise . # ID: And it can also do the action . # ID: And location finder . # ID: And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser . # ID: You can just say , where is my remote control . # ID: Or , you can just give some nickname to your remote control , like Bobby . # ID: And then , it will say hi . # ID: , hi , and then you can use it . # ID: our team is now fruits . # ID: Mainly strawberry . # ID: So , you can have # ME: Oh , these are strawberries . # ID: And then you can see the look L_C_D_ and all the switches . # PM: Are colourful . # ID: Material , we want to stick to titanium . # ID: We will send , we want to # ME: Fruit smelling spongy titanium . # ME: I didn't know it exist , but that's great . # ID: So , we want to have simple and perfect shapes , like I shown in these phones . # ID: You can have your own designs and you can feel simple designs . # ID: And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours . # PM: That's for the L_C_D_ or for the titanium ? # ME: You mean we can change the colour of th # ME: okay , for the L_C_D_ . # ID: With titanium it's it is silver . # ME: Tit titanium is # UI: We are still working on titanium . # UI: So , r we'll start with L_C_D_ . # UI: You can ask Bob . It's Tuesday . # PM: Hey , you know you're theme today . # ME: , Bob , please . Tuesday colour . # ID: Even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood , or s # ME: Black for Sunday . # ID: And you can have many colours on weekends . Or # PM: And w wait , wh what are the strawberries for ? # ID: , these are like sensors . # UI: That's location sensors . # ME: What do you think ? # ME: Strawberry sensors . # PM: Strawberries . # ID: after this meeting we'll propose a party for our success for # ME: Lounge meeting . # ID: So , if you are vegetarian or you have any options , please let us know . # UI: , and we can just some strawberry first . # ME: Alright . Good . # ME: So , huh . Interesting . In interesting . Mm mm . # ID: So , any specific questions for # PM: we'll see in the financial part if all gets into # ME: It makes sense . # UI: Let's make a party first maybe . # PM: W Who is the five fifty millions we first make a party in ? # ID: Then we can discuss , then we can have how much for how money is left . # ME: So , this is What a design . # PM: let's see if th it's meet the evaluation criterium . # ME: Let's see if this , if you meet the evaluation criterion . # ME: So , evaluation please . # ME: You made a very nice prototype , and , I think , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our what we want to do , and things like that . # ME: next slide , please . # ME: As you know , before going and creating and producing these strawberry remote control , it's very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have a chance to sell it . # ME: , so we need to evaluate it , try to do it in a constative way , and as much as we can . # ME: so what I propose is that we are going to have this scale from one to seven . # ME: One meaning that , ye yes it fulfils the criterion , whatever it is . # ME: And seven meaning , no it doesn't fulfil at all . # ME: And we're all l going to list all the criterion . # ME: I'm going to go to that next slide , and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven . # ME: And then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our remote control . # ME: So , maybe we can have a look at the criteria ? # ME: So these are the criterion I'm I thought were important . # ME: Of course , this can be discussed , but let's see , so let's vote . # ME: So we have fancy here and we have the scale from one to seven with four in the middle . # ID: , what's is really # ME: what do you think , is it fancy ? # PM: , I think that fancy , we can say it is fancy . # ME: It is very fancy . # ME: Or have you ever seen something like that ? # PM: Oh . I am not the d the only one choosing , . # PM: what do you think ? # ME: What do you think ? # UI: Feel the weight . # ME: The weight is later . # ME: Now we're We're on the fanciness now . # ME: I think it's quite fancy . # ID: We can give at least five or six , seven . # PM: It's in the other . # ID: Oh , Oh . So Oh , okay . , okay . Oh , okay . So # ME: , o one means it's , yes , a very fancy and seven mean no at all . # ME: So it's one or two . # ME: What do you think ? # ME: So here , two . Up . # ME: Then we have technology . # ME: So , what about technology ? # ME: We have we have speech recognition , we have location based , # ID: And we have L_C_D_ . # PM: Change colour of t # ID: So you change colours . # ME: Change colour , I mean that's very # ME: d I think it's a one for that , at least . # ME: At least a one , . # ME: Robustness , uh-huh . # ID: , still we need to cha # ME: So let's suppose my daughter take it and through it away . # ME: Do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again ? # ME: , maybe not the prototype . # PM: The strawberries # ID: Maybe strawberry . # ME: Okay , we just lost one strawberry . # UI: How can I say this . # ID: , we can easily plug it . # UI: It's still it's still working , and your daughter got a bonus . # UI: A strawberry . # ME: So it's not so bad . # ME: I would say three . # ME: , that does make sense , ? # ME: Well , so the question is does it have the minimum requirement of re remote control ? # ME: So I don't know . # ME: These buttons are It not clear . # PM: Oh , lets me try . # ME: But you have at least next produce . # PM: What is next , please ? # ID: I this is volume control and channel changes . # ID: These are the main # ME: , it depends on the # PM: And you can do di two sites ? # ID: , and you can do on L_C_D_ using these going to scrolling all the option . # ID: So if you don't want # ME: So but , for instance , because the L_C_D_ is not touch control , touch screen , you cannot go to channel twenty five directly . # PM: You can , by using the # PM: You c push here the # UI: So , the basic mode So that's simple . # UI: The basic mode is you got just two buttons and a jog dial . # UI: With two buttons , you do this like volume up , volume down . # ME: Oh , it's a jog dial , okay . # UI: Or if you go to the site , it's channel up channel down . # UI: And if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this . # UI: You select twenty , you select five . # ID: You can select . # ME: It's much longer than that being two five , no ? # ME: Don't you think so ? # ME: May not okay , we can go . That's You're right . # ID: Y you need to like press two and five and . # ME: That's it's less . # ME: But it's nice , because people anyway don't go there . # ME: So what do you think for it , usefulness ? # ID: So , d , we need to address we want # ME: Seems to be useful . # ID: we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_ . So # PM: Let me understand well , because I'm not sure that's for that this one are b d two dir directional button . # ME: Up down or left right . # PM: . And which what is that ? # UI: It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen . # ID: This is jog wheel . # PM: Okay , okay . It's a kind Oh , okay . # UI: Like , selecting the menus . # ID: see in L_C_D_ , like you will have blocks and you select which one . # PM: Oh oh okay , great . # ME: I would say then # PM: Now it's looks us useful . # ME: So size and weight . # ME: Is it the effective size and weight that the Is it real size , real weight ? # ME: Or Because it # ID: , it's size al almost # ME: Size is going to be that , ? # ID: because it is # ID: The weight will be bit lighter . # ID: We will s We use titanium . # UI: without titanium alloy , it's going to be light . # ME: It's going to be lighter , # ME: because this seems to be very heavy f I mean , for my daughter , for instance . # ME: Not sure if she can use it . # ID: But sides , the sides should be okay . # ME: So , should be okay . # ME: Up to three for that , because I'm haven't seen the weight so I must not # ME: Colour and shape . # ME: so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_ . # ME: But , it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh the case . # ID: The case is silver titanium , no ? # ME: It's a it's going to be titanium . Okay , okay . # PM: Let's imagine . # ME: I think it's good . Okay . # PM: And what about the strawberries on the top ? # PM: I'm not convince . # PM: But maybe I'm not trendy . But , # ME: Well y you know , it's this fruit and vegetable year . # PM: , but they're not useful . # PM: I mean it that's # ID: So maybe , I think # ME: , I think usefulness is m as I rem just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness . # ME: Whether it's fancy or not now , it we have to decide . # PM: I would have m i found more fancy that the fruits are useful . # ME: So , that they will that maybe the fruit may be here instead . # ID: , well then it's bit difficult to use . # ID: Not like this d We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too . # ID: So , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours . # ME: So , it seems we are not so clear on the shape # PM: I'm not sure why # ID: These buttons # PM: if it was like this # ID: But it looks really not really good . # PM: it's not fancy any more . # ID: I mean , the f So these are kind of rubber things . # ID: Even if you lose one you can just put whatever . # ID: Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and # PM: And different routes . Okay , I see what # UI: Moreover , moreover it covers it covers all the end goals . # UI: Even if it is , you know , it's very rounded , but still you got some rubber fruit here , and it's completely secure to leave it with children and that . # PM: Okay , so you feel like it's something a protection for the remote control . # ID: we have sensors here and so here and here , so we just so even if you don't put , it works . # ID: But this is really fancy . # ME: I suggested three . # ME: Because , everybody s doesn't seem to be convince , # ME: although it's quite You have good arguments . # ME: And the last one is adaptive . # ME: This is not r maybe not as important as the other one , but can we adapt it to each personal use ? # UI: Sure , sure , just look at it . # UI: It's full adaptable . # ME: Fully adaptable . # UI: , you can fit it into your palm , you know . # ME: So you can fit into your palm , okay . # ME: What else can we need ? # ME: You Do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well ? # PM: , it's fudge titanium . You know . # ME: , fruit titanium , . # ME: Well , I if this is if you are ready to do that , then I think it deserves a one . # PM: Okay . Let's go for one . # ME: Now we have to do the average . # ID: Three , three , six , eight , eleven . # ME: Who is good in math ? # UI: It's two point one seven . # ME: Two point one seven . # ME: Two point one seven out of seven . # ME: I think we have a good thing . # ME: Well , that's all I had to say about the evaluation . # PM: So it's a good evaluation . # ME: It seems to be good , . # ID: , two one seven , we have . So # PM: So now , it has to fulfil the financial criterium ? # PM: So , I have an Here . # ME: So so how many batteries do we need ? # ID: , we use bat One battery . # ID: Oh , we just need one , I guess . # ME: No , ne never install . # ME: Two batteries or one ? # ID: No , number is one . # ID: We need only one battery . # PM: but the price is two . # ME: No , no . But no , no . No , no way . # PM: Sorry sorry . I'm sorry . # ID: Number , number . # ME: You never use Excel ? # UI: What what's the limit ? # ME: It's twelve bucks . # UI: , it's okay that I don't know , 'cause it's not my field . # UI: Twelve bucks . # ME: Twelve bucks . # ME: Twelve and a half , I think . # UI: Check that number also . # ME: Okay , electronics . # ID: We have sample chip . # ID: like simple chip , . # ME: It's a simple chip ? # ME: Simple chip , okay . # ID: Four buttons at least . # ID: And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition . # PM: And for the One also . # ME: So the case , which one is it in the end ? # ID: I think we will go for a single curve , # ME: Let's do a single curve . # ME: It's flat , and curved . # PM: I thought you can curve # UI: But it is flat , # ME: It's curvable . # UI: It's curvable , but it's not curved . # ME: Maybe there is a supplement for that , It's only curve ? # PM: Oh see , I think that the price is this one . # PM: Don't chip on me . # ME: We tried , we tried . # ME: Mm , that's expensive . # PM: But she wanted u the fudge titanium . # ME: Let's stick to s titan . # PM: I think it's five , but you don't say . # ME: Special colour ? # UI: Well , n Why three ? # ID: No , only one , no ? # PM: Oh , sorry . Again , I'm See it . # PM: Special colour , # PM: or it's only on the # ID: Yes , in L_C_D_ display . # PM: , but there is no colour here . # PM: So I put it here . # PM: How many push-button ? # PM: Is there The scroll-wheel , okay . # ID: One scroll wheel . # ME: It's going to be expensive . # ID: One L_C_D_ displayed . # PM: That's that's not # PM: We choose this one , and not this one . # ME: Oh , I think , no it's # ME: , is it a scroll wheel and pe push button , th this centre one ? # PM: Or only a scroll-wheel . # ID: Only scroll wheel . # ME: Or only scroll wheel , okay . # ME: You are trying to make up make us up . # PM: Because how do you do to y select ? # ME: No , but you select with the two d the other two buttons , # PM: , I mean you go on the location with your scroll wheel # ID: Then it automatically we can just do like you feel , it goes . And it will activate # PM: Stay longer . Okay . # ME: It should stay . # ID: , plus , it's price is really # ID: Special colours , . # ID: , buttons and strawberries . # UI: buttons just normal . # ID: Special form . # PM: You you have all of these , no ? # ME: She's very hard on this . # PM: Mm maybe n not this one but # ME: Special colour ? # ME: Special material ? # UI: That's for buttons . # ID: , we have titan # UI: But buttons are standard . # ME: buttons are the standard buttons . # ME: It's only buttons , these . # ME: Nothing special . # ME: So we are at seventeen dot eight . # PM: Not special colours an interest in ? # ME: No , the colour is in the L_C_D_ . # PM: And buttons are not colourised ? # ID: I think because you can just go for a good colours . # ME: We can just use this red . # PM: It's already too expensive . # ME: So what is Are we supposed to cut things out now ? # ME: , until we get twelve fifty . # PM: So think of what we can cut here . # ME: if I look at what is the most expensive things , it's the L_C_D_ # ID: Sample speaker . # ME: and the speaker . # PM: Apparently , we have to choose one or the other . # UI: as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng , I mean , producing electricity from mechanical energy . # UI: So , the point is that when you take device and push the button , you produce enough energy # PM: But you don't need a battery ? # UI: to make electricity . # UI: that you don't need a battery . # UI: So , it's something like hand dynamo robot . A real high-tech version of it . # ME: So that would # PM: it's like the hand dynamo , no ? # ID: Maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand # ME: So , but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay , we only We we win one . # ME: That's already that . # PM: it's a it's a beginning . # ME: Okay , let's do that . # PM: One here and here . # UI: And I propose to So , about chips . # UI: Advanced chip on print , right ? # UI: So , put minus one there , please . # ME: I'm not sure if this is legal . # PM: M maybe minus three , no ? # UI: So , was there result ? # ME: Okay , let's see . # UI: Let's have a look . # ID: It's not changing , no ? # ME: Click somewhere , you'll see features . # ME: Maybe put minus two , so it looks more reasonable . # ME: Nobody will know . # ME: It's not recorded , is it ? # ME: Okay , we're on time . # ID: So now on , we can increase our Still you have two more . # PM: Oh , we can put a hand dynamo and a battery if you want . # ID: Maybe we can use it for our party . # UI: And a battery and a battery , . # PM: Both its it's cool . # ME: No , now we are exp exceeding I think . # UI: Now it's fancy , let's add one instead of two . # ME: I think we're exceeding now . # ID: No , but point five point three . # ME: We have to remove the , it's better . # ME: I think they are counting # ID: Is really strict ? # ME: We would prefer , # PM: and don't have to # ME: Maximum is maximum . # ME: So , remove one of them . # ME: Okay , we're on target . # PM: So target reached . # ME: I'm just curious to see this my address chip on print . # ME: , I would say it's the Russian trick , but # PM: but is English . So # UI: Well , I don't know . # ME: they may have some their origins , strange origins # UI: I am not sure who was programming this calculator , you know . # UI: 'Cause I wonder if we put A_ or B_ somewhere instead of a number . # ID: And we can discuss all these things in our party . # ME: Let's finish this meeting instead . # PM: Okay , so next mm No , that's yours . # ME: This is right . # ME: so finance , that's done . # ME: Are the cost under twelve ? # ME: Project evaluation , good . # ME: Project process . # PM: We have to make # ME: Safe asse safe assessment . # PM: Mm . See mm how Are we a good team ? Mm . # ME: , I think we've listened to everybody . # ME: Everybody could say what they thought . # PM: Is there enough room for creativity ? # ME: When we see the results , there is no doubt there # PM: Well , project evaluation . # ME: Maybe a lack of leadership ? # UI: M maybe not , huh ? # ME: Team-work , very strong , I would say . # ID: our team-work is really strong . # ME: Team-work , no problem . # ME: Whiteboard , digital pens . # ID: Oh , we still , I guess . # UI: What was the what was good ? # ME: I think white-board is useful . # ME: Digital pens , useful . # ME: New ideas found ? # PM: So , you say , is there sheep ? # PM: Okay . So luck , but good . # PM: Which imply good team performance . # UI: A good leader , you know , a good leader is somewhere in the shade and # ME: but then I mus That's true . # ME: And there's one very important point . # ME: Meetings finish when they have to or even before . # ME: for meeting it's one of the most important thing . # UI: Not to waste time , that's important . # ME: we have other remote controls to create . # UI: We need time f # ID: , we got new idea , speech recognition , location finding . New materials , new s this fancy strawberry design . # UI: New materials . # PM: new ways of doing financial # ID: And new tricks . # ME: just wondering if my what about the pink the pinkness of that # PM: They're working on pink titanium . # ME: They are working on a Okay , good . # ME: I think we are great . # ME: There's no other words for that . # ME: We are probably the best . # ME: Real Reaction is # PM: we're really nice . # ME: , celebration . # ME: Are the costs within the budget ? # ME: Of course they are . # ME: Is the project evaluated ? # UI: So , we see , we can even forecast . they propose us like celebration , everything , # UI: we could forecast it , right ? # ME: To the whole our company ? # PM: I'm the one , proposing the celebration . # PM: you know I'm the program manager . # ME: So , let's celebrate . # ID: So where we will go now ? # PM: I think it's finish . # ME: I think the meeting # ID: Will go to Italian restaurant , or # ME: The meeting is over at least . # ME: So , we have to go out . # ID: We can decide . # PM: And we go to the party . # PM: thank you to you .
# PM: Good morning everybody . # ID: Good morning . # UI: Good morning . # ME: Good morning . # PM: So , we are asked to make uh a new remote control for television . # PM: And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user friendly . # PM: So people can use it without any problem . # ID: Well , I think we should set the points to drive the project and # UI: B did you send us an email about this ? # PM: , not yet , but if you want # UI: , we received an email about this d designs . # PM: Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? # ME: Or you can put it in the shared folder . # UI: you see the email ? # UI: The v very the first one . # ME: No , I didn't get it . # UI: The third one . # UI: Oh , you didn't get anything . # UI: I got an email about the dis about the discussion . # PM: You get email , . # UI: I dunno from who . # ID: , from the account manager . # UI: From the account manager . # UI: You have received the same email , right ? # ME: I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . # UI: , so each of us has a role to do . # ME: I think assign your roles . # PM: For each for each one . # UI: We already have our role . # ME: For each person , . # PM: So there are so we have three # UI: So there are three kinds of designs , that's all . # PM: We have functional design , conceptual design , and detail design . # UI: Okay , alright . # PM: So , who will be the responsible for the functional design ? # PM: Any any volunteer ? # ID: I think our responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . # UI: I'm doing the interface . # PM: You are doing th # ID: I'm doing the interface . # UI: Are you using the you are doing the in # ID: Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design . # ID: It was a little confusion about my but it's alright . # PM: Okay , I'll for industrial design . # PM: And and you Norman ? # UI: working on i . User interface . # ME: , I'm into marketing . # PM: doing the marketing . # ME: nothing much in the project . # PM: Nothing related here to the # ME: Marketing in this design . # ME: A design is basically for industrial design and the user interface . # UI: You see the second mail ? # UI: See there's a role for everybody . # UI: Even for the marketing . # ME: us user define . # UI: But look at your role , your marketing role . # ME: There's a trend watching . # UI: that's your role . # ID: Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done and what are your ideas about the # PM: About the design or Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? # ID: Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for T_V_ distribution I guess . # ID: So we have to plan how it would be developed and how we can make it work . # ME: I mean working remotes we already have . # ME: This will be something different from the other remotes remote controls . # PM: What we have to keep in mind the these characteristics . # PM: And of course it should not be very costly . # ID: Well I think that Norman and I would think about the technical points and we should discuss it in the next meeting , or # UI: Need to collect information . # PM: About the about what ? # UI: I I'm part of design , perhaps . # UI: , what is most important in a in a remote control ? # UI: What is the most important function aspect ? # PM: You mean the external or # ID: Well , you have to make it work . # PM: of g of course . # UI: That's alright . # ID: That's the that's the big thing . # UI: , it should be easy to work with . # ID: We can think about an interface with well # UI: We maybe you can have a speech recognition interface . # UI: You just tell the television I want which channel . # UI: Or or you can say for example , I want to list all the programme tonight . # UI: Y you know , instead of remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . # UI: Just say maybe I just want to press I wanna have a button for all the movies tonight . # UI: Or a button for all the magazines , all the information documentary tonight . # UI: And then you list a few , and I will choose from the list . # UI: So instead of pressing the channel number , I am choosing the programmes directly . # UI: , that's one way of making it useful . # PM: I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . # UI: because it's not very a lot . # UI: Th this information exists . # UI: For example you can get # PM: Like s you say we can use speech . # UI: You can use well for example anything . # UI: The the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but and it's more natural . # ID: I think if you want t to choose from a list of programme or something like that you may have to use w I dunno # ME: I mean the main function of remote control is to have something in the hand # ME: and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control . # ME: If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog # UI: Yes , possible . # ME: if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it . # ME: And I could talk to the T_V_ television itself . # PM: Except if you are far from the T_V_ . # ME: I need not have an I mean we have some or something , different technology but # UI: But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . # ID: On the content . # ID: , it's a good idea it's a good idea # UI: So it's more powerful . # ID: but I think that technically it would be a little bit uh more tricky to achieve this than just to # UI: because you see now all the T_V_ programmes are available on the webs . # UI: They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . # UI: We just say that this are some content . # UI: We just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes . # UI: Some of the websites they already provide this service , so we can just use the service available . # UI: Download it to the to this remote control . # UI: And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . # UI: The most there are only seven buttons . # UI: So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to choose among the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons . # PM: we should also optimise the number of buttons . # ID: Well I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to navigate through the Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so # PM: This is good idea . # UI: , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? # ID: in the dis display on the T_V_ screen # ID: and just with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f # UI: I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . # UI: Because all the T_V_ the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . # ID: I think for the technical points we have to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff # PM: So we have five minutes to # UI: w we have sometimes to use the white-board . # PM: you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we # UI: Five minutes . # ME: And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of So , I mean , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . # ME: The lighting in the room changes . # UI: , but we are designing just remote control . # ME: I mean , we have a option in the remote control . # ME: If we want to have that option , you press that button in the remote . # UI: Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? # PM: If if you can if you want you can use th the . # ID: Please , Norman , draw # UI: Go on , draw something . # ME: Oh , I'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel . # PM: Or before the before the design that says . # UI: Where where is it ? # PM: Be before writing you can sit and that says what we what we said then after that you can you can use the . # UI: Okay , alright . # UI: So so the most functional des mm the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . Right ? # UI: We agree on that , right ? # UI: , first one is to buttons i or it could be anything with buttons . to choose content s or channels . # UI: So we have both . # UI: The user can choose w which one they want , right ? # ID: by content or by channel , # UI: By content or by channel . # ID: it's a good idea . # UI: Choose by contents or by channels . # UI: And then what did we say just now ? Other than this . # ID: And we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents . # UI: so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . # ID: I think i it's not very difficult to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so # UI: so these we have to work it out . # UI: So this one of the problem . # ID: I think that's the things to do # UI: The main thing . # ID: and to reflect about it # UI: Okay . Alright . # UI: Alright , okay . # ID: and discuss it in the next meeting . # UI: So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get the funct this is the functional designer ? # UI: That's the first aspect . # UI: We will get information and then we'll come back in . # ID: Thank you everybody . # PM: So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? # PM: And we'll discuss the other aspects . # UI: Alright , okay . # PM: Okay . Well thank you all .
# PM: So we come again for the second meeting . # PM: for the aim of this meeting now is to make presentation about the work for each one . # PM: And take the decision about the design and the functionality of the remote control . # PM: And we have think I got a new project requirement . # PM: So I think teletext becomes outdated . # PM: So the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet , and I think we don't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the television . # PM: And of course we should have our image in the in the design . # PM: So , let's start with the industrial designer . # PM: Or y you can use the whiteboard if you want . # ID: Well I have a PowerPoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder so I think you can reach it from here . # ME: Just go to explorer . # ME: Participant two . # ID: Participant two . # PM: Do you want to open # UI: Because it's open you mean . # ID: Right , so I will talk about the w working design and # ME: Slide show , view slide show , . # ID: And well I will present my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television . # ID: So can you go one page down , please . # ID: So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve what we want to do . # ID: So mm I'm thin I think I I'll do a survey about what is what is available on the market and what is the cheapest possible things we hav we can use . # ID: Then I will try with the technical team to build a prototype and to see with h how this little box would look like . # ID: And how an and we can start troubleshooting first com communication problems or things like that . # ID: And when we are ready with this first prototype I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or things like that . # ID: Okay so can you go down So , wha what I think for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired so I think we u we can use a battery for the . # ID: Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication . # ID: And the communication with the T_V_ set is made through infrared communication So this is the schema of the o of the future remote controls # UI: Did you draw it ? # ID: so you can you can see the components , battery and the two chips goes to the infrared connection to the T_V_ set . # UI: What is the other chip for ? The one on top . # ID: The one on top is for the well the functionali the functionalities # ME: One is a communication . # ID: and the th red sorry the green one is to well , putting things together , f transform the data into qu into the format to communicate with the T_V_ set . # ID: I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for the functionalities which is easy to t # ID: It's field programmable something array . # ME: Gateway arrays . # ME: It's a field programmable gateway arrays . # UI: So why's it how is it different from the Bluetooth ? # ID: Well , a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can you can pr programme it wi with wh whatever you want . # UI: Programme it . # ID: And well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to make the communication between the two devices . # UI: So this are the they have to work together ? # UI: Or ? Do they have to work together or two separate choice # ID: Well , th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the data to send . # ME: Or it's something like isn't hardware the first one ? # ME: And the second one is for the software . # UI: Is the is the software par alri okay . # ME: to run th to make it run . # UI: So you can control if you want , right ? # ID: Alright and that's it for the working design . # ID: So if you have any questions ? # ME: Okay , and how about the battery power ? # ME: you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? # ID: no , I think we have to have embedded b batteries in the # ME: more compact and okay , # ID: And I don't think it will need very much power to make it run , so # UI: Mm . You can put it on the charger when you when you don't need to use it . # ID: It's a good idea . # ME: Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always . # ME: People don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out . # ME: We just make a small charger and put it # UI: Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ? # ID: That's a good idea . # ID: Also , but I think the goal is to sell our remote control . # PM: we can change the b . # ME: Our remote , we do not want to make it P_D_A_ . # ID: S okay , so charger for is the . # PM: Participant one , no ? # PM: Oh we have so let's move to user interface design . # UI: So you can open # UI: So I'm working on the technical functions design . # UI: can you show the next slide . # UI: So the purpose is to find the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . # UI: So so I found on a webs on the internet # PM: During the weekend . # UI: I spent a lot of time searching # UI: and I found that the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . # UI: For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on . # UI: So I found two very good prototypes for this interface from our competitors so can you # PM: This are usual functionality . # UI: Ours is a bit different . # UI: So these are two example . # UI: One is from the other one is from , engineering centr . # UI: This is the most competing prototypes I've found . # UI: But then loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons # PM: And they are small . # UI: O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that if I have hundred channels I have I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number so it's very lousy . # UI: So you so you move to the next the next one . # UI: , so I talk about the problem . # UI: And then I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick , so we don't want that . # UI: So I propose the easy to use prototype . # UI: You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some to do some preprocessing . # UI: From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the on the remote controller , right ? # UI: And then we the speech recognition as Harry says we may just put in we may K_I_V_ . # PM: What do you mean by the pa processing will be done on the T_V_ # UI: , all the processing is done the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the # ID: So we have to t # PM: So we should have specific T_V_ ? # PM: Or ? We can use this . # ID: We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too . # UI: because are you just wondering what controller okay . # PM: J j just the remote control . # ID: I think there is there is al there is a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to do the processing on the remote control because # UI: So i the processing on the remote controller so it can u be used in any T_V_ , any conventional T_V_ sets ? # PM: Speech recognition . # UI: So I come up with a simple design , just keep the v navigation buttons . # ID: Yes , that's a good idea , I think . # PM: Keep the navigation # ID: We d we don't we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on the T_V_ so Well , f four five buttons , it's sufficient . # ID: It's easy to build , it does not consume much power . # UI: Okay , that's all . # ME: Oh , but you have a catch there , assume that if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then . # ID: Well , then y you go to the main menu and you have go to channel and then you can # UI: No , because you choose by channel , so you choose by T_V_ program # UI: so you don't have hundred channels to choose from . # UI: If you go by channel , you don't have to do that . # ID: but I think i if you if you want to make well a big jump but well you have to have a device when you could you could # ME: then that's right . # ID: Well , not a mouse but something that says more clearly that right , left , up , down , well , the to have the ability to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or # ID: we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that . # PM: How the this remote ? # UI: it's gonna be small . # PM: , of course small . # UI: So it'll beep if you wanna find it # ME: too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it . # UI: you just shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . # UI: I dunno how bu # ME: just give it a name and we call him . # UI: And responds to you , and # ME: , that's right . , that's right . # ID: Okay , so next presentation # PM: Participant four . # ME: Okay , after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here . # ME: And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that These are the findings which we got and adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote but the technology We already know that as discussed earlier # ID: Well I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to make a speech recognisers runs on the small ts # ME: An it does how feasible it is . # UI: But I think if you to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem . # UI: I if you just recognise numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary # ME: Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . # ME: We just have the # ID: And this can allow to choose the program , for instance without adding buttons so it's a good idea . # ME: it's not going to take much space also . # ME: It's going to be very slim . # ME: And next one was the size of the remote control . # ME: It has to be of course a very slim and small one . # ME: And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , so this is an important criteria here is # PM: But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility . # ME: I mean we have to look for a trade-off . # ME: The features and the cost . # UI: I no I think that i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with reasonable cost . # UI: Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , # ME: Little bit more if it's with extra features . # UI: , extra features . # ID: , s speech is a important extra feature I think # PM: But is it useful or not u I don't know . # PM: There is in the # ME: I mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . # ME: Or they say movie name or I don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast . # ME: So , I think this should be a good idea , to put this features . # ME: And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages . # ID: we just have to find a mean how to add a m a microphone or well yes a microphone into the remote control , so # ID: it will be alright . # PM: If it's necessary can you can do that . # UI: What is the teletext ? # PM: We can integrate small microphone in the remote so it's not really a problem . # PM: What about lighting adaptive options ? # ME: as discussed in the earlier meeting , but I think not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . # PM: According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that . # UI: It is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller . # UI: So you need s special T_V_ sets to do that ? # UI: Or it's done via this remote controller ? # UI: It's very complex . # ID: I think it's a bit complex too # ME: I mean , it's for the industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not . # ID: For our next product , our new T_V_ set with automatical sound adjustment light # UI: , then we can conclude that . # UI: but it's quite possible but maybe not in this project . # PM: So we have I think we have s still we have couple of minutes . # PM: So any things to discuss ? # PM: Or any suggestions ? # ME: I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for marketing . # ME: The speech interface and less reasonable cost . # ME: And the lighting adaptation and the teletext . # ME: And regarding the teletext these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . # ME: If you are watching an foreign movie , you get subtitles sometimes . # ME: And if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French . # ME: And if I am a German then I would like to have the my options in German . # ME: So , the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages . # ME: That should be a good point . # ID: , but well what about the new project's requirement ? # ID: I think we should give up with teletext , no ? # PM: I think we can we # ID: Well , so maybe we can j we can already think about a way to access the internet via the television . # UI: Using the T_V_ to access the internet ? Or what ? # UI: I didn't quite understand # ID: , but we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet . # ID: So it's a good idea if i if we i if we think about how to build up our remote control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years . # ME: We already have some . # ID: So if we already have it in our remote control # PM: So you have to anticipate the future ? # UI: The future demand , market demand . # ID: well , not to implement it , but to well , to find a way to add to add this functionality in a , in an in an easy manner , if is possible . # UI: The functionality in the future . # UI: Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital , right . # UI: All the programmes , everything will be in digital than analog . # UI: Th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change . # PM: Okay . So let's go for the lunch break , and we will meet after . # ID: Okay , thank you . # UI: Okay . Thank you . # ME: Okay , thank you .
# PM: So we come to the third meetings . # PM: so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design . # PM: So we will talk about some specific details . # ID: Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept so can you please open I'm participant two . # ID: Components design . # ID: Okay so the first thing I have done is to made a review together with the manufactural department and have which components was available to build a remote control . # ID: So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and kinetic well kinetic technique to store the energy . # ID: We also we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control . # PM: this is what we have decided in the last meeting . # PM: But if we use battery # ID: b f well I meant by battery I meant I will not have a wire between the remote control and the energy source but I didn't fou we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the remote . # ID: So it's a point to discuss . # ID: Then the case material we have uh also several choices , like wood , rubber , titanium or latex . # ID: But well it's not a re well a real issue for the from the technical point of view . # ID: Concerning the interface we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so . # ID: And this is the last point , the choice of chips . # ID: So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic energy collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi won't work in a cluttered environment . # ID: So so I think we can start with these two main things . # ID: For the case well I think that titanium is a good choice because it's trendy and it's well it's modern and user are mm will be very happy to have a nice remote . # ID: For the interface I think that we can ach achieve all the desired functionalities by s just using rubber buttons , simple buttons and th thus this allow to use a regular chip that are well cheaper . # ID: And s so we can move to the next slide . # UI: What is this single curved what does it mean ? # ID: Well uh i it's the shape of the of the remote . # ID: You you will have the well the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the # UI: When you hold on it , it is comfortable to hold . # ID: It's more confog f comfortable that if these it's completely flat . # UI: And the battery , is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter ? # ID: the that's the point . # ID: The kinetic one is y you can recharge by the # UI: That that's what it means by kinetic . # ID: and by well by just by moving the ar your arm the mm well the remote will accumulate energy . # ID: But I d I don't know it's if it is feasible because I don't know if yet if the user will move enough to provide the remote all the necessary energy . # UI: We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product ready for market . # ID: And and so can you go to the next slide please . # ID: So and that's that summarize well what I have said . # ID: So you're right we can see in our R_ and D_ if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy . # UI: the department . # UI: So I keep in touch with the R_ and D_ department . # ID: I take care , it's all right . # UI: So the titanium case is the normal case that I'll show you some pictures that I have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not . # UI: 'Cause I am not very sure , plastic , titanium or whatever . # UI: There's another point I want to make , is that the well you've seen them I le na my presentation that I point out some why buttons are not the mm not the only ways you can use maybe n # UI: So the user interface is i it uses the aspect of a computer system , a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data . # UI: So you s this gives you the ways to input data and we have we are more we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here . # UI: The idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on so you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing . # PM: What's the function of this button . # PM: I think it makes the interface really # UI: Ea easy to use . # PM: Graphical user interface . # UI: function five . # UI: So I can use the button , the mouse maybe . # PM: A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures . # UI: So the here are some examples . # UI: So they cluster the buttons together . # UI: They group them into col they colour them and they have different forms as well . # UI: but this interface are kind of confusing . # UI: basically there are too many buttons . # UI: Right . Next one . # UI: So some people are propose voice recognition by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you . # UI: So I just got an email saying that . # UI: And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that , supposedly . # UI: Mm so somebody some people use some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , you can use that as real so that could be an option as well . # UI: Touch screen , I mean . # UI: And some people propose a scroll button . Integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button . # UI: Like the one we have here . # UI: so there are a few aspects that I collected here . # UI: So s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people , and mm and prog basically they are programmable , specially for children . # UI: And then they also secure covers , to protect secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings . # UI: But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features . # UI: I'm just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people . # UI: , so that's the point . # UI: And you see this is the one where you have the protection cover . # UI: Mm maybe useful for children , they migh you they only see the buttons outside . # UI: And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside . # UI: So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside . # UI: So this guy this is another company that provides big buttons . # UI: I see that is useful for old people and then you don't get it lost . # UI: But for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use . # UI: And you can call your remote controller if you don't know where it is . # UI: T_V_ remote controller where are you ? # UI: And then , he will beeps and to say that I am here , for example . # PM: We should include speech synthesis in this case , no ? # UI: Is it possible ? # ID: but as Norman say if there is already a commercial product available who t who do this we can check to integrate it i into our new remote control . # UI: And , this is another one where you can the part that's a V_ standing for the volume . # UI: So there's a up arrow and a down arrow . # UI: But you the see that in the V_ , the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top on the top up arrow if you up arrow there's a V_ like as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface , so I wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design . # UI: And here are is here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found . # UI: Big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools . # UI: And user customisable is important and finally simplicity is the key . # UI: we have many concepts there but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used . # UI: And basically # ID: Well I think you it's fine you have reviewed all the possibilities but uh well i if we consider that the user interface is displayed on the T_V_ screen I don't think we nee we need much buttons in the remote since we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that , because adding wheels or scrolls makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , so . # PM: Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the user m might in the in the T_V_ . # ID: That's a good idea . # ID: To have a help button . # UI: A help button . # UI: So you are display on the screen . # UI: So on the T_V_ screen . # ID: On the T_V_ screen . # ID: On the T_V_ screen the how to use your remote . # PM: So just you push the button # UI: Okay . Okay . Okay . # UI: So that eliminates all the complicated documentation , # ME: But people are often enough looking at the help , # ME: once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff . # PM: In the case where they need help , in the case where they need help . # ME: It's a psychology . # ID: In a marketing point of view . # ME: And let us see what the market demands . # ME: We could just go to my presentation . # ID: But wel well I think # PM: It's just for user customizable , for kids or old people . # ME: I mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids and if you remove the # PM: So it's the same # ME: Same remote with some # PM: Can be used by both kids and old people . # UI: Well what I s propose is that you know a remote controller , i it could be a cube , is a small device that looks like a cube and maybe you can just change the buttons , if you ch turn one side you get one buttons , you turn the other side you get the other buttons , so for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls . # PM: Maybe for kids , kids they like t no l they like to # ID: So le let's see what people want . # UI: Let's see the market demand . # ME: And then we can decide what we can . # UI: What what market yes . # ME: So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes . # ME: And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires . # ME: we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions . # ME: And we found the following solutions which we could which would be helpful for our design . # ME: So seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything . # ME: And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy . # ME: And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . # ME: And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot . # ME: And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons , so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times . # ME: So this were the findings which we found . # ME: And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls . # ME: Most of fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them rather than watching the T_V_ . # ME: And by the time they found the remote control the program is finished . # ME: So they're frustrated a lot And if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it . # ID: Mm , the functionalities . # ME: So you can just see the percentage , fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex . # ME: So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them . # ME: We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control . # ID: Well mm w well I don't really see the advantage of having L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a big screen and display on the screen . # ID: of course it's fancy trendy and so on but it's expensive to produce and it's not really # ME: I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy . # ME: So if we have a L_C_D_ on the remote , rather than looking onto the T_V_ you just look into a remote and navigate it . # ME: It's the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control . # ME: We just play around # ID: but when you play with the iPod you don't have a big screen in front of you , s # PM: You can use this screen instead of the big se screen , instead of use the . # UI: If you re-use the existing screen , we element eliminate the L_C_D_ , after all the L_C_D_ just to display and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , as fancy as the one on the L_C_D_ , maybe even better . # ME: I mean this were the points which we got from the market demands . # ID: So I th I well I think we can focus on the on the fancy look # UI: More on a fancy design . # ID: on the speech recognition if the technology is available # ID: but well I think L_C_D_ will make us spend a lot of money for not so big results . # UI: Remember we have a s budget for the cost of producing the remote controller . # UI: so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost and then we'll decide again . # ME: I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers . # UI: maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time . # ID: So price of L_C_D_ display . # ME: And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls . # UI: And also the cost for the speech recognition . # UI: Ask our R_ and D_ department . # PM: it's just for small vocabulary . # ME: it's o only for a limited vocabulary , say eighty commands or so . # UI: And also the scroller button , how much will it cost . # ID: Well compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button . # ME: Mm , the scroll button , from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button . # ME: Because they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or help button . # ID: I think that well as we have seen in the in the presentation well about uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button # UI: Don't use the buttons . # ID: so I think to have five simple button is sufficient for our functionality . # PM: It doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important . # PM: But they are just less used compar # ME: They're not used much . # ID: But the thing is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the T_V_ screen like a list of function and then you choose with the with the button to well you navigate # UI: So so the at most more power . # PM: Or maybe we can u or maybe we can make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others . # ID: But if i if we if we could have a display g a user interface that is very complete on the T_V_ screen I think that just five buttons are sufficient , one to go up left right down and enter and you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that . # ID: You don't have to switch to a channel to another # ME: Or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have a L_C_D_ on the remote not on the television . # ME: Because when you have the L_C_D_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background , we are most focused on the commands . # ME: So if you have then L_C_D_ in the remote , you just have a menu , and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu , in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the stuff . # ID: but if you look at the L_C_D_ you don't look at the T_V_ screen # ME: And accordingly you can just increase or decrease . # ID: so i it's not really worth to get to have the image if you don't look at , so . # PM: And I think it's increases the cost of the remote control if you use L_C_D_ . I # ME: that has to be checked out . # UI: I think that there's no contradiction here , because if there are few buttons , you don't have to look at your controller any more because you know where the buttons are , so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness and then you t turn you just press lef increase or decrease button and the same for the volume and the channel , if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel , just tell your channel and then you don't even have to look at the butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the need for L_C_D_ , with the help of speech recogniser you can # ME: I mean , better if we could just check all the cost with L_C_D_ and also with the speech recognition . # ME: And then we could find which would be a more suitable in this case . # ME: And the third problem was to find the remote control . # ME: Always , so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes . # ID: Well so we can think about a well a vocal command like find and when the remote control hears fine well just to make him beep or t # PM: You will listen to a peep , special peep . # ME: that's right , that's exactly what I mean by voice commander . # ME: Or it could be also something like this , it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control , so we have some one charger there and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger . # UI: Put it back at the charge . # ME: And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the remote control beeps , wherever it is . # ID: And that's a good idea , that's simple , like in phones . # ME: I mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command , # PM: But you don't you don't have to move the charger . # ME: because there are problems with a voice command . # PM: You have to keep it . # ME: I mean charger would be fixed because it's always with electricity plugged . # ID: if there if there is nuff not enough battery . Also and uh the remote is lost . # UI: Mm . There's mm . Mm . # UI: That we can what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button , the off button , the remote there be s instruction on the screen , please charge me . # UI: You never get it lost because every time you're off the computer the T_V_ you are asked the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger . # ME: It's an good reminder , # UI: So you will never get lost . # PM: Maybe for some people lazy people . # UI: because everything is programmed inside . # UI: So it's all about strategy , y # ME: And of course the final point is a fancy look . # ME: As we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by Norman they weren't fancy , # ID: They were ugly . # ME: I mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons . # ME: I think we should have something it # ID: Well the last one with the with the two parts was original , so # UI: With two parts controller . # ME: I mean I mean I mean you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it , you can't avoid him . # ME: But you can have an button for child lock . # ME: So just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he can't use even # ID: Well we can think about having on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , things like that . # PM: Or maybe you have to show some specific programmes for kids and then just push kids button so it's automatically # UI: these are probl # ME: I think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think # ID: So for mm So for my part I will check the prices the prices difference of what to use , where to use , and s and so on . # ME: I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th these could be included . # UI: I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser because if you want say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . # UI: If numbers , they're easy , but if name the channel by name # ID: Well I think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like sports and then on the T_V_ you have a list with uh well with sports program playing now and # ME: we have a problem there . # ME: You see if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five . # ME: So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers # ID: Well but well e every possible word has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so . # ME: I mean the you just check all the probability that saying T_V_ twenty five and just ordinary twenty five . # ME: Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent # ME: and T_V_ twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent . # ME: So it's better to have some prefix before the number . # UI: But I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than the numbers . # ME: something , some code . # UI: You say numbe channel number five of the T_V_ correspond to something else in the channel . # UI: So some people may want to say , I want to see this channel . # ME: That will be too big . # ME: And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also . # UI: Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser . # PM: It's difficult to just say the name of the channel . # PM: It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel . # PM: Because you have to s t a ch # UI: Well , it's convenient for the user . # PM: but you have to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary . # ME: Als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number . # PM: Or maybe Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary , # PM: just pronouncing the name of channels and include in the vocabulary . # UI: I think that I have mm I think there's another way you can do is that you can if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little squares of images where you have a snapshot of every channel , so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , you just use the control button , you just you just choose the option you want and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel . # PM: Or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel . # UI: So you don't use the speech recogniser in that way . # PM: Just you have in the beginning you have t you have to train you have to create the vocabulary by yourself . # PM: By associating each channel with the name or # ID: I also think about another problem , if there is more than one person who is watching T_V_ # PM: And for each one has his own . # ID: the s well the speech r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two . # ID: Because I remember when I was a young child with my sister we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time # PM: Or you have to s # UI: , I wanna watch this , I wanna watch that . # ID: so it's a pr it could be a problem if well if someone passes by when you are watching T_V_ and say oh T_V_ thirty and just run , s # ME: A and in the same lines we would have a one more problem . # ME: If we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name bad reputation for our company . # ME: So I think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands , say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something . # PM: Or we can switch on or switch off the special , . # ME: that's right that should be an option . # ID: well I think that's a good a good option because it's simple and simple to implement also , so . # ME: I think these are the practical problems . # ME: So we need to take care of them in the design . # PM: Maybe we'll discuss them in next meeting . # PM: It's time to close this meeting . # UI: Well , you stay a five minutes . # ME: Oh it came there on three minutes back so we are I think we can just press the okay . # PM: Thanks for your collaborations . # ME: Okay . See you another thirty minutes .
# PM: So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control . # PM: So let's see the what did you prepare . # UI: so can you go out to the shared folder ? # UI: Mm the shared folder . # PM: Sh share folder for th your presentation ? # UI: We have a presentation . # PM: Because I have here # UI: So I got the participant three . # UI: It's the final design , # PM: Okay just one . # UI: S so I discussed with Guillaume . # UI: And so we have and we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . # UI: So we come up with two versions . # UI: One with and one without L_C_D_s . # UI: but both comes with a charger and then detachable and or control module . # UI: And detachable big buttons for all people . # ID: S okay so I'll show you the two prototypes . # ID: Here we have the first one with the beautiful L_C_D_ display . # ID: You you can s here . # ID: And you can just browse into the navigation menu by joystick joystick-like button . # ID: You can choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function . # ID: You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here . # ID: And here the switch that control if you want # PM: Why you why you put it in the side ? # ID: Well I think it's the # PM: It's not a good place maybe . # UI: No i it's the all around camer microphone isn't it . # UI: The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere . # ME: Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? # ID: Well so it's a microphone array . # PM: Oh it's very costly , microphone array . # ID: it's just a single microphone , and you I think we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to well it's better to place it here th than here , for instance . # ID: And here is a little switch that control if you want the speaker recognition system to be on or off . # ID: And so this remote control comes up with its charger . # PM: How much does it cost this one ? # ID: Well this prototype is made for about well fi fifteen dollars # PM: Fifteen dollars ? # ID: fifteen dollars , # PM: it's above it's above the budget . # ID: but well it's not it's not but it's just a prototype and if we if we optimises the voila . # ME: The cost would be le reduced . # ID: the and the production costs we can achieve about ten dollars . # PM: How many b battery is there ? # ID: How many , excuse me ? # ID: Well f battery , we use about # UI: Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . # UI: A_A_ rechargeable batteries . # ID: Rechargeable of course , # UI: rechargeable batteries . # ID: because we have the charger . # UI: We have the charger so it's no problem . # PM: So one battery ? # ID: On one battery . # ME: Is that two or one ? # PM: It's kinetic reserve . # UI: Actually it's a flexible thing . # ME: Now what is the whole day rating for that ? # ME: Whole day's rating . # ME: What type of battery ? # ID: it's just a r simple battery a rechargeable if you like it's exist . # ME: Something like a two A_ , A_ three size batteries ? # ID: So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the charger and leave it alone , it's alright . # ID: Then the next time you pick it , oh it works . # UI: I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , b this button # ID: just explain the button Norman . # UI: This button is like the mouse is like a joystick , you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button . # UI: You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . # UI: So a swing to the left , a swing to the right defines other functions . # UI: So even though it's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement . # ME: And the L_C_D_ is this one , on the remote ? # UI: This is the version y that comes with L_C_D_ . # UI: Here I present another version without the L_C_D_ . # PM: I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months of function is getting destroyed . # UI: okay this is new prototype . # ID: So we have the second version also with the different button configuration . # ID: The second version is also simpler , we d we had just I have to put the microphone also . # ID: So basically th it's the same # ME: Uh-huh and also the switch . # ID: Basically it's the same things uh as I presented before . # ID: But here we have we have four buttons for navigation . # ID: Press one button acting as a enter button . # ID: So according to what you said it's more robust to the user . # ID: And it's also cheaper to produce . # ID: We can produce such remote control for about four dollars . # PM: No four dollars , it's good . # ME: And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , because that's a major that's a # UI: th actually th we'll come to that point in our # ID: it's embed in the speech recognition system . # ME: and if you disable speech recognition system then ? # UI: W w I'll come to that point later on . # ID: so Norman will explain to you . # PM: And we will we will serve the charger with this ? # UI: Th they either these with the charger any # PM: With the remote control . # UI: in either versions you they ha they use the same charger . # PM: so the price of the charger included in the # UI: it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price . # ID: Thank thank you . # UI: It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but again depends on the types . # UI: I think we have to investigate more on that , but # PM: The price should be below twelve and a half Euro . # PM: Well that's so # UI: but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design . # PM: We have we have just # ME: people are willing to pay more , but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment . # PM: The price of selling is twenty five Euros . # PM: And the price of production # ID: Alright please go on Norman with the special features . # UI: we'll come up to that , the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . # UI: If you want less function i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , so is modular . # PM: That's for this basis function and if you want more you pay more . # UI: for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it put it back in , or you can use the other one , # ME: Something like customised . # UI: or the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah . # UI: You want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see . # UI: It's pretty flexible in the price . # ID: You also have the two other modules for the parental control # UI: you should present that . # ID: that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control # ME: And this is other one ? # ID: i if you if you want to have more power on what you do , and which channel you want to choose and so on . # ID: H here is just the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up they come up with their modules , they just plug in it and they can have all the control they want here . # ID: We also have this module for old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , and it acts like the previous one , you just plug in and it works . # UI: the i the idea the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful . # UI: Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the mm the same powerful functionalities . # UI: But in addition with simplicity . # UI: So that's the best idea , the cond that that's our an innovation i in this design here . # UI: Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you . # UI: The first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on . # UI: And then we also have security feature for example this here oop it's very robust , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ? # ID: The titanium # ID: and so it's very # UI: Again and the battery life is an is an endurable one , again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . # UI: Lithium-ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . # UI: So when you finish watching your T_V_ and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ , and then there's this message coming out that please put that back to the charger , so that's the or is it that's the reminder part . # UI: And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define And then because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a of T_V_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children . # UI: So instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the T_V_ contents of the night . # UI: So it's pretty powerful , and that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . # UI: And and for the materials that is cheap to produce I think it's quite clear from . # UI: And also like the and the fancy designs . # UI: Maybe we can improve more on the design but # PM: What's the price to p to produce ? # ID: Well so the price to produce For the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . # PM: With with the charge ? # ID: it's about it The without the charger # ME: With the charger ? # ID: it's about well two dollars to produce the microphone and speech recognition systems . # ID: Two dollars for the for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger . # ID: So if you sum up everything wi with the L_C_D_ , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two . # PM: We don't have charger . # ME: I think we can use Excel . # PM: We don't have all the options . # ID: so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about fifteen dollars . # PM: Charger we don't have charger here either . # ID: But it's just if you want all functionalities . # PM: it's below the budget . # PM: It's below the bu the budget . # ME: it's a nice input but we have an other inputs from the l public demands . # ME: I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu I think we can just go to my presentation then . # ME: We can wind up . # ME: Or we could come to some f final conclusions . # ME: So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and very handy to hold . # ME: And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative . # ME: Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . # ME: And the third one is easy to use . # ID: Well I think that the technical in innovation is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh with just four buttons . # ME: Okay and if we go to the next slide , here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like . # UI: Spongy spongy . # ME: So I think it should be much more customised to make a different shapes . # ME: And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy . # UI: But the problem is that is it robust to mishandling ? # UI: We have you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy . # ME: so finally we have these three criterias . # ME: One is fancy look , second is innovative , and third is easy to use . # ME: So these are the f three criteria on which we are going to build our remote . # ME: So and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven , and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this . # ME: So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ , so on this scale , if it is true , if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it doesn't it looks it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . # ME: We can make our study on this and # UI: so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users ? # ME: we have you have designed two products now , one is with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ . # UI: But who will give the scoring we ourself or a third party ? # ME: According to you , according to you designers , how will feel does it with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ? # ME: Okay let us make this L_ and without L_C_D_ . # ME: On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control . How do you look how does it look ? # ME: D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ? # ID: Well it doesn't look much fancy I'll say three or four . # ME: And you both agree for that ? # UI: I think we can improve on the design . # UI: Som someone commented this is like a the stone age design . # UI: we have been focused all this time on the on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . # ID: Technical aspects . # UI: As for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help . # ME: So I take three on with L_C_D_ ? # ME: So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ? # ID: I think it's more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated so removing the L_C_D_ gives us a li more liberty to have a fancy look . # ME: And in the sense of innovativeness , with L_C_D_ . # ID: Well it's the same for both so I will give a five , six . # ME: Five with L_C_D_ and # ID: Well five also Norman please . # UI: from the innovation aspect I feel that what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , because that is really innovative , and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity , few buttons , we've A lot of functionalities . # ID: With lot of functionalities . # UI: So that is that is for both th # ME: So without L_C_D_ ? # UI: I think that the our product is has the best in all well this is a biased judgement because we designed them . # ME: according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ? # UI: the innovation is v is very high I think . # ME: And without L_C_D_ ? # ID: Mm for both it's the same innovations . # UI: It's the same innovation . # UI: So maybe I can put six to seven . # ID: six , let's go for six . # ME: actually to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts . # ME: So I there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness . # PM: no innovative . # UI: uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ? # UI: We haven't really determined what are actually # ME: I mean that what you are sayin that's what the design # UI: it's good to have a L_C_D_ but what are we gonna display on a L_C_D_ ? # ME: No it's like this , I mean on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . # PM: So let's remove it . # ID: but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen . # PM: This is the problem . # ME: on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now . # ID: If you have the L_C_D_ , but if n # ME: Then there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ . # ME: Or then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a # UI: But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ . # ME: I mean that depends upon your design , so # UI: Anyway for the users who opt for L_C_D_ we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ , we give what the customer wants , right . # ME: So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? # ME: And which do you recommend e easy to use , with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_ ? # ID: Well I think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons , and well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product so I will give a six for the easy to use . # PM: No it's just if I see the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ . # PM: Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price , and I thi i they have the same rate so without L_C_D_ it will be # ME: Or we can just go back to the previous slide where we ha we have a few updates . # ME: So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition . # ME: Even then our product is going to be very good . # ID: it's cheaper to produce . # ID: And if the well if we have less technology we have more liberty to for the shape and things like that so # UI: I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . # UI: I think the easy to use aspect is different for different people . # UI: For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons . # UI: For kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , # UI: so that's why we have the parental module . # UI: we can ha have build a more complex design if they want it , but what I'm trying to say here is that the we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . # UI: So in terms of easy to use I think it's very user customisable . # UI: User customisation is very important # ME: So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ? # ME: Or you want it to be six ? # UI: I think it's the same . # ID: Yes as you say , with better # ME: S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ . # ID: And to improve the look . # ME: As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also , and it's going to be much simpler to use . # ID: Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so let's go back to our laboratory and # UI: To improve on the design . # PM: What a what about the sys speech recognition ? # PM: what about the integration of speech recognition ? # UI: The speech recogniser is a add-on module . # ME: That's going to be an optional . # ME: If somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no . # PM: so it's optional with the okay . # ME: It's an optional . # ID: It's optional , since well according to this study people more likes more to have a spongy remote control than # PM: I think it will be I think i I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these # ME: but I mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just hide the parental module and so that their parents can't use it . # PM: Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , so mayb better if you have all this in the same # ME: In the same set , and individual buttons to make them work . # UI: The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . # UI: So we might lose the customer because of this . # PM: So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional will be optional . # UI: what do you think ? # UI: Yes exa what do you think , I don't know . You are Marketing Manag . # ME: I mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that how many married couple or how many couples have a T_V_ or to the number or singles who have a television . # ME: So based on that I think # UI: But the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? # PM: I think it inc increase . # ID: Well you can if you had something li # PM: I think it i increases . # ID: because if you if you add something well maybe because it's three different pieces to build but # ME: But you can make it on a single P_C_ with three different options . # ID: it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities on the same module , but # ME: On the same P_C_B_ # UI: Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you gonna maintain the you're gonna keep the same customer , because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons . # ME: I mean you could just provide with an optional . # UI: i so if don't buy now they can buy i in the future . # UI: So in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again and again . # ME: So it's something like a Microsoft product update . # PM: And and we don't want that . # UI: We're not trying to follow the Microsoft and we don't want to the m # ME: Updates and we sell it . # ME: We make updates and sell it . # UI: well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ? # UI: , it depends on the v production . # ME: And what's the idea about the shape of the remote controls ? # ME: can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? # ME: Do you require different types of P_C_B_s and # ID: I think we are but we are also the well the components will have to change because we have to deal with the shape and but I don't think it will increase the cost too much so # ME: Or it could be like this the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior shape is different o for all . # ID: but it's a bit complicated to if you need machines to different machines to well # UI: What we can change is to propose the customers with skins . # UI: For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin # UI: and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better . # ID: we can have the same global shape and then add on skins and with this tex spongy texture things like that . # UI: you can pl in what material would that be in ? # ME: I think you need to look into the material . # UI: or furry like a pet dog kind of thing . # ID: So we finished the prototype presentation if you have something else to say . # ME: I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models . # PM: Project evaluation project satisfaction , for example . # PM: I don't know , we have to ask these question . # PM: We have to give answers so # UI: I suppose that you this criteria , is it ? # PM: Project evaluation . # UI: Room for creativity . # UI: This room is a bit small , but I think it's okay for us to work with . # ME: I feel it's fine , we know we don't need I think it's okay . # ID: That was good . # ME: This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations . # UI: anyway we have the laboratory nearby to build our modules so it's okay . # ME: And the leadership was excellent . # UI: Good job good job . # PM: He gave you the liberty to talk as you wants . # PM: the teamwork was very good . # PM: I was really I am very satisfying to work with you . # ID: Very democratic . # ME: And new ideas found . # ME: Any new ideas to make these presentations more interactive and more interesting ? # ID: Come up with new product . # ME: I mean what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting ? # UI: Mm we I know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings . # ID: and also more well more seriously I think it's a good idea to have clear points whenever we do a meeting prior to the meeting to have well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , but I think it's alright . # ID: We achieved project goal I think . # ME: that is within the budget . # ID: yes , more or less . # ME: And the evaluation was # PM: Without without L_C_D_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple . # ME: And the next is celebration . # ID: So coffee machine . # UI: Alright then , we finished ? # PM: thank you for your work and # ME: thank you , thank you very much . # UI: Thank you very much .
# PM: Good morning . # PM: Good morning . # PM: good morning everyone . # UI: Good morning . # ID: Good morning . # PM: I'd like to welcome you to our first meeting . # PM: I've prepared a little presentation . # PM: My name is and I hope you will introduce yourself in a few minutes , as will I . # PM: I'm the Project Manager of this project , and , well I will tell you on what actually is the project . # PM: This is the agenda for our first meeting . # PM: this is the opening , then we will get I will hope we will get acquainted to each other . # PM: We'll do a little tool training with these two things . # PM: We'll take a look at the project plan . # PM: there will be time for discussion . # PM: Actually we have to discuss because we have to create a product . # PM: And then we will close this session . # PM: but first of all we I'd like to introduce you to this room . # PM: as you probably have noticed there are little black fields on the table . # PM: you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face . # PM: there are cameras everywhere around the room especially here for your face , of course , and this isn't a pie , it's a set of microphones and there are microphones here also . # PM: But please don't be afraid of them . # PM: They won't hurt you . # PM: I said I'm the Project Manager and I'm hoping for a good project and I'd like to hear who you are and what your functions are on this project . # PM: Let's start with the ladies . # UI: and my function is User Interface Design , I think . # ID: I'm the Industrial Designer and I hope to look forward to a very pleasing end of this project . # ME: I'm Marketing Expert . # ME: My job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers . # ME: I also h hope we have a pleasant working with each other . # PM: Okay , well we have some expertise from different pieces of the of the company . # PM: I said we're working on a project and the aim for the project is to create a to design a new remote control which has to be original , trendy and of course , user friendly . # PM: And I hope we have the expertise to create such a project such a product . # PM: the way we hope to achieve that is the following methods . # PM: It consists of three phases , namely the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . # PM: As you can see , all of these phases consists of two parts , namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss our work so far . # PM: But first I will tell you something about the tools we have here . # PM: I already talked about the cameras and microphones , but they are not of much use to us . # PM: we will have to take advantage of these two things . # PM: They are smart boards . # PM: As you can see , you can give a presentation on them . # PM: And this one here is a white board . # PM: I will instruct you about that soon . # PM: as you also noticed this presentation document is in our project folder and every document you put in this folder is it is possible to show that here in our meeting room . # PM: and there are available on both smart boards but I think we will mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder . # PM: As you can see , this is the same tool bar as is located here . # PM: the most functions we will use will be to add a new page , to go back and forward between pages , and of course to save it every now and then . # PM: and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board , for instance like this if everything's okay , but I first have to put it on the pen , you see I'm new to it too . # PM: and then you can write things like test or whatever you want . # PM: As you can see you have to move it a little bit slow , it's not such a fast board , it's a smart board but also a slow board . # PM: but you can write things and of course you can also , when you click here , erase things , so we have est left . # PM: And you can also delete an entire page , but we ask you not to do that . # PM: Just simply create a new one and start all over because we want to save all the results . # PM: does everyone understand this # UI: So we can't erase anything . # PM: nice application ? # PM: you can erase it with the eraser , but you shouldn't delete an entire page , but just create a new blank one . # PM: I will delete this one now because we don't use it yet . # PM: But you can of course erase when you make a mistake , but don't delete entire pages . # PM: And you can also let's see I think it's here change the colour of your pen , for instance take a blue one and change the line width like to five . # PM: that's what you will need for our first exercise , because I'm going to ask you to draw your favourite animal . # PM: It's also to gets to know each other because I'm asking three things , for that drawing , to do it on a blank sheet , with different colours and I just showed you how to pick a colour , and also with different pen widths which I also showed you . # PM: and a favourite characteristic can be just one word . # PM: I'm not very good at drawing , but I will go first and try to draw Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing , eh . # PM: could be everything . # ID: With a tail and a mouth . # PM: Maybe when I put on # PM: this thing it could be a turtle , or a snail , # UI: the snail doesn't have legs . # PM: But a turtle has . # PM: And those are slow . # PM: And I hope our project group will not be slow , but we will work to a good result and do it as fast as we can . # PM: time for another animal . # PM: Would you like to go next ? # ME: No problem . No problem . # ME: Mm . It was four months ? # ME: To make it a little bit easier . # UI: It's a giraffe . # ID: Make that cute . # UI: Or a dinosaur . # ME: it's a giraffe . # ME: I think it's easy to r to recognise as a giraffe . # ME: the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck , it can reach everything . # ME: And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project . # ME: that's my favourite animal . # ME: Anything else you need to know ? # PM: Could you write the words , underneath it ? # PM: Or more words . # UI: Should I Alright . # UI: I can draw , . Well . Oh . # ID: Bunny rabbit . # ME: A bunny rabbit . # UI: you can guess what it is , I hope . # ME: Uh-huh . No problem . # PM: Little rabbits . # UI: And well it's quick , I guess . # UI: That's my favourite animal . # PM: And our final drawing . # ID: I draw I I've drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence . # ID: One of the most intelligent animals in our world . # ID: intelligent . # UI: You can try out the eraser now . # ID: Well not perfect , but okay . # PM: Okay , well thank you very much . # PM: I can see we have some drawing talent in this group , # PM: nice animals , nice words . # PM: back to business , back to the money part . # PM: from the finance department I have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of twenty five Euros . # PM: And we're hoping for a aim of fifty million Euros and we are hoping to achieve that by aiming for an international market . # PM: And the production cost will be twelve Euro fifty max . # PM: Okay , well it's time for some discussion . # PM: I've wrote down some examples here of what we can speak about . # PM: what's your experience with remote controls , what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control , maybe for which market segments should we aim , or should we aim for all segments . # PM: actually I'd like to hand the word back to you . # PM: What's your experience with remote control ? # UI: I always lose them . # ID: A lot of buttons . # ID: And you always lose them . # ID: A lot of buttons which you don't use or who you don't use # ID: Not user friendly . # UI: search for the buttons , which one is which # PM: Boring , it's not fun to use a remote . # ME: Black , all black . # ID: Black colours . # PM: maybe we should try to make it fun . # ID: They use batteries and batteries and poor signal . # UI: Perhaps that you have a lot of road remotes r road con remote controls . # ME: the angle you have to use . # ME: You had different remote controls for different devices . # ID: different remote controls , # UI: perhaps you can integrate them or something . # ID: for the use of different devices . # UI: Your stereo and your T_V_ Perhaps that's an idea . # ME: but then again you still have a lot of buttons , # UI: And which you don't use . # ID: but you could I thin there's a possibility to g to put those buttons behind some kind of protection so that if y you only get to see them when you need 'em . # ME: okay , that's possible , # ID: That's possible , so that you only get the # ME: but it'll get very big the remote control . # UI: You should just give it to . # ID: No n no , for example you got th the same size remote control you use everyday , but the usual buttons such as zapping as you call it in Dutch . and the volume control are only the only possible buttons to use directly . # UI: Changing channel . # ID: Or the numbers , of course . # ID: But not the buttons used to search on the channels on your television . # ID: You only use those the first time , # ME: play , pause , stop . # PM: maybe a minimalist design , the least possible amount of buttons . # UI: But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it . # UI: Because things for teletext , I dunno , w # UI: what's the name ? # PM: you don't want to bother people with loads of buttons , but on the other hand they need many buttons so they don't have to get out of their seat . # ME: Because I think a market will be all kind of people . Elderly p el elderly , young people , so . # UI: But if it's if it's international you should look in think in Britain they have different things they can do with the T_V_ , or so that you can choose what you want to see . # UI: I dunno if you should take that in consideration , or that you just should aim for the normal T_V_s # ID: I understand . # ME: I think that's the better one , # ME: because I think if you you're going to target a lot of people and the whole world and only Britain then I think the cost will rise higher than the twelve fifty , I think . # UI: I don't know if the they have that anywhere else , though . # ME: I think the aim is better to use the whole world and Britain , . # UI: , we can leave that . # ID: When I think of it # ME: Not that much . # ID: I think the main idea of this remote control is to make it user friendly . # ID: I think when p when the customers will buy this remote control , they already have the remote control which companies uh with the standards remote control with which comes with the television . # ME: Mm . Standard deliver . # ID: it only has to have the most used buttons . # ID: You don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television . # ID: In those in that # UI: but then you have to find your other remote control if you want to search . # ME: th it it's I think that's not # ID: but it is impossible to accommodate all the buttons on the s on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control . It's impossible . # ID: Because for example Sony television has the opportunity to s to make uh to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen teletext , and on the other side just n regular television . # ME: I think n m n most televisions nowadays do this . # ID: but they don't use the same signal , on remote control . # UI: Well not everywhere . # ME: So I think numerals . # ID: Because you can't use a Panasonic remote control on a on a Philips television . # ME: but then you have to choose the always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code . # UI: you can choose the code . # ID: Okay . Okay . Okay . Okay , # ME: You can use which type of television you have . # ME: That's no problem . # ME: But I think like the two pages on the same screen , like teletext and normal television , that's nowadays standard , I think . # ID: but I think that most people th will buy the remote control because the first they lost the one they lost first one # ID: or the first one is broken , so uh perhaps they have a got a an older television , so that option is not optional for those people . # UI: But the people have a new television , and c if you look into the future , then they want will want the button , if their thing is broke . # ID: So we should take that in consideration . # PM: Okay , well any more ideas ? # ID: Things'll come up . # PM: Okay , well we have some time . # PM: Let's see what more I have to tell you . # PM: I don't think there is much left . Nope . # PM: We're starting to close . # PM: our next meeting will start well we're a little bit early , but our next meeting will start in thirty minutes . # PM: In the meantime there's time for some individual actions . # PM: , as you can see , the different roles have different tasks . # PM: And there's a ping . # PM: Is it my laptop ? # ID: Stop the meeting now . # UI: meeting will close in five minutes . # PM: that's good , five minutes and the meeting's over , right on schedule . # PM: the Marketing Expert will take a look at the user requirement specification . # PM: The User Interface Designer will work out the technical functions design . # PM: And this was the Interface Designer ? # PM: Or the Interaction Designer . # PM: Or what was it , I_D_ ? # PM: Interface Designer , okay , first guess was right . # PM: will take a look at the working design . # ID: the Industrial Designer will take a look at the working design , and the in usability interaction # PM: Industrial Designer , okay , # PM: Let's just use the acronyms . # PM: and of course specific instructions will be sent to you through your personal coach . # UI: I should look at what you should be able to do with the remote , or , or how I don't really # PM: well those instructions will be in the email you will receive shortly , I hope . # UI: Right . Alright . # PM: And of course you have your own expertise . # PM: Well that was what I had to say . # PM: are there any more questions ? # PM: Okay well I think then we have to head back to our offices and start working . # ME: I have one question . # PM: one question ? # ME: Where does it says we have to make a remote , because I presumed She didn't know who . # ID: No problem . Okay . # PM: we're still going . # PM: Okay , well I expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive shortly . # PM: Okay well see you all in about thirty minutes , then . # ID: Alrighty . Okay . # PM: Thank you very much .
# PM: Good morning , again . # ID: One question . # UI: Choose a number ? # PM: Let's see what we can find here . # PM: A very warm welcome again to everyone . # PM: here we are already at our functional design meeting . # PM: and this is what we are going to do . # PM: The opening , which we are doing now , and the special note , I'm project manager but on the meetings I'm also the secretary , which means I will make minutes as I did of the previous meeting . # PM: And I also put these as fast as possible in the project folder , so you can see them and review what we have discussed . # PM: if I'm right , there are three presentations , I guess each one of you has prepared one ? # PM: And we will also take a look at new project requirements , if you haven't heard about them yet . # PM: And then of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions and we have some more time , forty minutes . # PM: But I think we will need it . # PM: well I don't know who wants to go first with his presentation . # ID: I'll go first . Okay . I'll go first . # PM: You can go first , okay . # ME: shall I go first with the users ? # ME: I think okay no problem . # PM: Is there an order ? # UI: everybody already has his presentation , # ME: Ja precies , ja precies , ja precies # UI: so you can adjust it . # PM: And one question , your name Denni , is it with a I_E_ E_I_E_ , okay . # ID: I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control . # ID: It's possibly very handy if you want to design one of those . # ID: well so it basically works as I uh r wrote down in this little summary . # ID: when you press a button , that's when you do pr for example when you want to turn up the volume , a little connection is made the rubber button just presses on a on a little print plate which makes uh a connection gives the chips , which is mounted beneath those that plastic of a rubber button . # ID: senses that a connection has been made , and know and knows what button you pressed , becau for example the volume up or volume down button . # ID: the chip makes a Morse code like signal which then is si signalled to several transistors which makes which sends the signal to a little let . # ID: You know what a let is ? # ID: And that makes the infra-red lights signal which is sent to the television set . # ID: which has a sensor in it to sense the signal of the infra-red . # ID: That's basically how it works . # ID: the findings uh that I found searching up some detailed information about the remote controls , are that they are very easy to produce , it is pis it's possible to make them in mass production because it is as eas it is as easy as printing a page , just fibreglass plate is b is covered with some coatings and uh and chips . # ID: and the technology's already available , we don't have to find out how remote controls have to work or how that how to make some chips that are possible to transmit those signals . # ID: I made a little uh animation of about how a tran our remote controller works . # UI: There is something turning . # PM: it's a little bug it's in the in the smart board . # ID: Okay . well the sub-component , I suppose that you understand what a sub-component is , is f in this example it's the button . # ID: when it is pressed down , the switch is ter is switched on , so with the wire is sent to the to the chip in co-operation with the battery of course , because to make a signal possible you have to have some sort of li a d ad electronic # ME: Infrared light . # ID: after it's being composed by the chip the signal is transported to the infra-red bulb , and from there it signals a Morse code-like signal to the to the b to the bulb in the television set . # ID: I wrote down some personal preferences about the remote control . # ID: Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held , so you don't have to uh wind it up or something , or just is it's very light to make to use it . # ID: I personally pref prefer that it would be p come available in the various colours , and easy to use buttons . # ID: But I suppose that the one of the other team members uh thought of that too . # UI: I've got it there too . # ID: And it is possible for several designs and easy to use b sorry , easy to use buttons . # ID: Perhaps soft touch , touch screen buttons because the rubber buttons are always uh they slightly they can be slightly damaged , so the numbers on the buttons are not possible to read anymore . # ID: And well as I said before th we can make several designs . # ID: Okay , well , that's my contribution to this meeting , # ME: To this meeting . # ID: two of these this meeting . So . # UI: Shall I go next ? # UI: my name's , and I looked at technical functions design of the remote . # UI: I did this by looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they look , and information from the web that I found . # UI: well what I found was that th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , how you d what you described just early . # UI: And this can be all sorts of medsa messages , turn it on , turn it off , change the channel , adjust volume , that kind of thing . # UI: play video , teletext , but also t play C_D_ if you use it your C_D_ player the remote control will that one . # UI: There are some examples of remote controls . # UI: You can see they are very different . # UI: The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of buttons etcetera . # UI: And the other is more user friendly , little with big buttons . # UI: And not n all the stuff you can do with it , but the essential stuff is there . # UI: I guess you could better y you should look at a user centred approach , because the customers have to use them and if they don't think it's usable they won't buy it . # UI: A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that . # UI: personal preferences is a simple remote , with the basic functions that you can need that you could use . # UI: But keep in mind the new functions of T_V_ what we discussed earlier , split screen and is that a function that you should have ? # UI: Because all the T_V_s will have them . # UI: Or because of only a few and isn't really necessary . # UI: And then make it I would make so that you can could use it on more than one appliance . # UI: If you have one that uh does with the vi the video , it could also work with the stereo , because play is play and stop and that sort of thing . # UI: The shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for anything . # UI: And it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much . # UI: And that is my presentation . # UI: You must still have it open . # ME: We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , or just , and the users , actually . # ME: The methods I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . # ME: Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? # ME: And then tho that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section . # ME: Younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . # ME: And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . # ME: The elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area . # ME: Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . # ME: So we don't have to make it very small , like a mobile phone or something , but some somewhat bi bigger than small , so you don't lose it that much anymore . # ME: Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or shouldn't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use . # ME: Important issues about the remote . # ME: I think it would be better with a personal reference , but okay . # ME: Remote control has to have to have a low power usage , because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one time an hour , or so , with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries . # ME: The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those they those have to h be find very easily . # ME: And have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera . # ME: It has also be have to find easily when the label is gone . # ME: My colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off or would be s senden okay . So if that's k if that's the problem , you also have to find it easily on the remote . # ME: Buttons . Like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized . # ME: or should be covered , or in L_C_D_ screen . # ME: L_C_D_ screen is easy because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options . # ME: Put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone . # ME: And you don't see the buttons . # ME: So L_C_D_ screens should be easy , but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot . # ME: So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use . # ID: L_C_D_ screen as in touch screen ? # ME: , touch screen , . # ME: The last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . # ME: Because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people . # ME: And the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control . # ME: So we have to keep in mind to focus not a lot not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people . # ME: And on my personal preferences , I don't have any mo more time to come with that , but like I said , L_C_D_ screen is easily to use because you have you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons . # ME: And it should be easy to use . Especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels . # ME: And that is it . # PM: thank you all , huh . # PM: I dunno did everyone receive an email with the new project requirements ? # UI: No . Res I did not . # UI: Perhaps the rest ? # PM: then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them so you can all read them . # PM: Oh , well not in this presentation . # PM: Should be in there . # PM: I can tell you them from my laptop . # PM: teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet . # PM: So that's the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to teletext . # PM: the remote control should only be used for the television , otherwise the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time to market , and of course would make it more costly , I think . # PM: our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , and you talked about that before . # PM: And a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , which means that our corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . # PM: So we have to keep that in mind . # PM: according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions . # PM: who has any idea about what should be on it , and what shouldn't ? # UI: you said it should only work with one appliance ? # UI: Or with one d che only the T_V_ ? # PM: Only be used for television . # UI: And the video also , or not ? # PM: it says only for television here , huh . # ME: Only the television . # UI: Oh . Alright . Okay . # PM: Makes it a lot easier , # ME: Requirements , Functions . # UI: Then it should have on , off , # ID: Standby options , # ME: the basics then by a volume , channel , one till two zero numbers on it , # UI: And per perhaps # ME: oh teletext doesn't have to be ? # ME: other functions . # UI: Well uh yes s sh A button where you can change from one number to two numbers . # ID: Two s two digits , # UI: Don't know if that's got a name , # ID: I understand what you mean . # ME: I think it's I think it's easy to implement a button with a s what which especially do that , because some T_V_s , if you press the t one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve , # ID: It makes it twelve , . # ME: and that's not relaxed # ID: and there are some models that don't accommodate that function . # ID: the Philip's television makes it possible in that indeed to press one and then two to make the tj to reach channel twelve . # ME: So that it easy and fast . # ID: But all the television makes use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to get # UI: so you should have that one on . # ME: Our main targets' age are ? were ? Forty five plus , or ? # UI: Mute misschien also . # PM: new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty , and now we have current customers of forty plus . # ME: Forties , okay because younger people as younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are f eighty one percent interested in L_C_D_ screen . # ME: From twenty six to thirty five have sixty six percent , and thirty six to forty five , fifty five percent , so I think to Because on most recog remote controls the print plate will be broken how much , two years . # ME: You have to press h very hard to go to the next channel . # ME: With the L_C_D_ screen it's easier because you only have to wipe the screen to for fingerprint , # ID: But I think that collides with our mission to make it very cheap . # ME: and then you can use it again . # ID: Because L_C_D_ screens are very expensive . # ID: A touch screen probably even more . # ME: but a you don't know # ID: is it possible to make an L_C_D_ screen , how was the information ? # ME: it only says that this perce percentage like L_C_D_ screen . # ME: Because , and it says that younger age between sixteen and forty five highly interesting features more critical . # ID: perhaps we should we should focus on that L_C_D_ screen . # ME: And if the only f because our target is sixteen to forty five . # ID: but will we not exceed our production # ME: you don't know how much it costs . # ME: you don't know how much it costs , the L_C_D_ screen . # ID: Is it possible to find out , anyway ? # ME: I don't have any costs here , # ME: I only have percentages . # UI: But if you would do an L_C_D_ screen do we have don don't you have any buttons ? # UI: Or because if it only directs at the T_V_ , then you only have I don't know what you want to do with the L_C_D_ screen . # ID: an L_C_D_ screen's just like a drawn here . # ID: just displays several buttons , for example if you wanted the minimal use b buttons , such as channel and volume , you just h displays four buttons on the screen # UI: Oh right , so you can # ID: and it's possible to p press them down , just like a touch screen . # UI: you can adjust which buttons you want on that s screen . # ID: , we can make it possible to do that , . # ME: if you want to adjust , like for example , adjust the audio settings , you press audio on the touchscreen and you get the buttons for audio settings , # UI: alright , oh right . # ME: so the other buttons are gone . # PM: we're going for an L_C_D_ screen ? # ME: I think it's the most easier thing , # PM: And hoping that when we produce a lot it won't be too expensive . # UI: we had twelve fifty , I guess , for production ? # ID: Twelve fifty . # ID: I suppose wi if the mar if our if the i if the young people are interested in L_C_D_ screens , we should make 'em . # ID: And if that is our d market share to and our goal to deliver those remote controls # UI: But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people , but also on the older , and will they use it if it only has an L_C_D_ screen ? # ME: forty six to forty five , thirty three percent , and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent . # UI: so still a little bit people # ME: But our what's it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty . # UI: But you don't want to alienate the other # ME: No , that not now , # UI: But if they also buy it then it's alright . I guess . # ME: but market share fro for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger . # PM: Okay , so L_C_D_ it is ? # ID: Mm . It's treasure . # PM: And what else ? # ID: I hope we h and let's hope to reach those sales . # ME: i if it if it costs gets too much , too expensive , then , we should be sticking to rubber buttons . # ID: can you s I think that they will send you some information about the cost of L_C_D_ screens . # ME: nothing , no costs at all . # UI: But perhaps later , # ID: so if you if you receive an email about that , can you post it in the or shouldn't we post that in our projects mail folder . # ME: I think that should I think we all get the costs of everything . # ID: Because you are the Marketing Expert . # ME: , okay , I'll post it . # UI: perhaps we should have a backup plan that we would use buttons if it's too expensive . # PM: But for now it's L_C_D_ . Okay . # ME: Then you have the seventy five percent of users find it r ugly . # UI: Oh that's a bit of a problem . # ME: and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with a when a remote would look fancy . # UI: Oh , that's a bit of a problem . # ME: Tha i l i it'll look fancy with L_C_D_ screen . # ID: It's looks fancy one , of L_C_D_ screen . # UI: but they don't they don't like it . # UI: They think it's ugly . When it has an L_C_D_ screen . # ME: just a the plain remotes , not specific L_C_D_ remotes . # UI: Oh , alright , I thought that you said that . # PM: and maybe you can make something fancy out of an L_C_D_ remote , because it's new , as far as I know . # ME: And then you have the other thing , that seventy five percent zap a lot , but that's not a f question with the L_C_D_ screen . # ME: Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time , to get all the fingerprints off it . # PM: what else does our remote need ? # UI: A mute button . # ME: The most important things on a f on an on an remote control are channel selection , volume con selection , and power s power usage . # ME: And a teletext , but that is not of the question . # UI: But shouldn't you put a button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it ? # ME: Other things are # UI: Remembering we have got a big remote that you have to fill . # PM: and we could make an a separate menu on the L_C_D_ screen for teletext . # ID: And there's also a # ME: And other less important things are screen settings , audio settings , and channel settings , # UI: they are less important , but I think they should be there , # ME: Less important . # ME: should be there , but not press # ID: but in a sub sub-menu or something like that . # ID: I think it's also important to make it possible to how do you call it in English , to not use batteries , and use ac bat batteries to be # UI: Like with a with a mouse , you have not , . # ID: yeah sure . Indeed . # ID: So you can mount the # ME: in a breath it's # ID: the remote control to # UI: We should think of the twelve fifty we have # ID: to refill the # UI: I don't know how much that's going to # ME: but we don't we don't have any costs now , # ID: because i when you get an L_C_D_ screen , you run it on batteries , the batteries will be empty very soon , very fast . # ME: power supply is one of the most important things . # UI: You should Perhaps you should be able to switch the control off . # UI: If you have an L_C_D_ screen that's burns all the time I dunno . # UI: You shouldn't on and off because that's ver extra , that you have t first you have to turn the remote on , and then you can I don't know . # ME: I think it's not that easy because I don't think people will like it who that you have to turn it on first and then use it , # ME: so I think it's better when th the T_V_ shuts down , the remote shuts down . # UI: But then you can't # ID: And go to standby mode when you don't use it , so that # UI: automac matically , that it . # ID: , automatically . # ID: After two minutes or three minutes , something like that . # ME: After two minutes , two three minutes , . # PM: And maybe a low battery indicator ? On the screen . # ME: And then b that before an hour when its get again gets empty . # ME: Then you have plenty of time to recharge it , of put it in a recharger . Charger . # PM: So we are going for the for the recharger . # UI: If it's sensible . # ME: because when you're watching T_V_ , you're zapping and you have to put it in a recharger , # UI: b when the batteries are low # ME: and I don't think it # ID: when you when you're done with s w watching your television , you have to put it # ME: but then we have to be sure that the batteries go hours , six hours , five , six hours , then . # UI: But you'll also forget to put it in , # ID: sure , of course . # UI: because you throw it on the couch # ME: then you have a problem . # UI: and you don't remember . # ID: But you also forget to buy batteries , # ID: and then you can you can't use it , # ME: Or we have to be sure that the batteries last couple of days when they're recharged . # UI: I think the batteries should w should work a lot longer than a couple of days , # ME: because you have b but you have L_C_D_ screen . # ME: High power usage . # ID: High power user cell , i it should be a standard move to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television , that's also a great advantage because you can't lose it anymore . # ID: Because you are obliged to put it in the charger and not to leave it in a couch between some cushions . # ME: you made a point there . # UI: But then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the T_V_ . # ME: otherwise all your . # ME: Just a small device . # UI: I think everything has it for and I guess . # ID: it hasn't It doesn't have to be big . # ME: Plug it in , that's it . # ME: like a like telephone charger or something . # ID: just a cable , or a even a charger where you can mount it on . Something like that , # ME: It has to be easy to use also , or things . market share , speaker re speech recognition . # PM: you have some more points . # ID: Functional designs for the elderly you could make it possible to enlarge the screen , # ID: so make it possible to not display a button at ten points # ME: I think that this should be standard . Large button large buttons . # ID: but it is one of the functions you have to specify . # ID: Because we can look at uh perhaps forty buttons at a screen , but the elderly only look at two buttons . # PM: And you said something about speech recognition ? # ID: Speech recognition ? # UI: twelve fifty , twelve fifty . # ID: twelve Euro fifty . # ME: Twelve . That's an also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent . # UI: So it's pretty big . # ID: spread it by a big market . # PM: Even bigger than for L_C_D_ . # UI: I know let's do a speech . # ID: let's leave out all the remote controls and just put a microphone on top of the television to # ME: Ninety . Twenty five . # UI: You can clap or something . # ID: Turn volume up . # ID: that's an idea . # UI: Now you shouldn't say the wrong thing , I dunno . # ID: Okay , well that should it has to be remote control , # UI: But they want to talk into the remo remote control , or something , # ID: Sure why not why not # ME: Is this only would you would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . It's the only thing it says . # UI: but do we want to implement that , # ME: I think an L_C_D_ screen should be suf sufficient . # PM: But when you look at the percentages # PM: Speech recognition scores even higher , huh ? # ID: Perhaps the options should be Why not ? # PM: maybe because of the cost , but nobody knows how much it will cost . # ID: Let's hope to have some d # ME: I think I think it's better to have L_ L_C_D_ screen , because in the area of tw thirty six to forty five , we have about thirty percent of the market share in our hands , and fifty five of those people want L_C_D_ screen and thirty five want speech recognition . # ME: So I think it's better to keep it with L_C_D_ screen . # PM: But would it be useful to imple implement both ? # PM: On one remote ? # ME: , if the costs al allow it . # UI: I don't know if that can be done with the cost of twelve fifty . # ME: If it should be done , if it could be done , I won't matter . # ID: We should do it . Sure . # UI: but how would you like to implement that , that you say volume up , and then it goes up , # ID: Certain systems already exist , I think . # UI: Then you also have to have different languages if we go international . # UI: Then it's y it's yours to do a French and Dutch and English # ME: But that should also be with f should be also with L_C_D_ screen . # ID: This should be accommodated with some software , # ME: Because then I think in Chinese is different written , volume is different written than Swahili or something . # ID: Swahili . Swahili . # UI: you can use icons for the a speaker and # ME: Ja , well possible . # UI: But if that's better than language for the for the remote . # ID: So we want to it's international okay . # PM: no speech recognition ? # UI: if it could be done , we # ID: it should be done . If it could be done , should be done . # ME: we have to keep . # PM: and then we have different languages . # UI: that should be anything matters . # ID: That's not so difficult at all , # PM: just make a separate remote for each # ID: because I already use on several voice operated systems , and they are all possible to not all , but # UI: you sh you should to adjust the thing . # ME: I think it's difficult . # ME: Every language of dialects I think it's very differen difficult . # UI: And you have to speak the so that it can understand . # ME: I think it can't be implemented , but maybe # UI: You could use that n as an option , if you have money left , or something . # ME: , 's an option , yes . # ME: Fifty Euro cents . # UI: Let's do speech . # ID: For speech recognition . # PM: so we only do this when we have enough money left . # PM: Okay . Well I've written down an on or off button , volume selection , channel selection , the digits from one to zero , huh . or from zero to nine . a digits button to switch between one and two digits , mute button , a separate menu for teletext , a battery indicator . # PM: we're going to use a docking station and probably L_C_D_ and if there's enough money , speech recognition . # PM: And the possibility to enlarge buttons or to have large buttons in general . # UI: With teletext if it wasn't ver very important , it was but You also now have colours . # UI: I don't know if we should implement that . # UI: when you press the red button , you go to page one hundred two , and when you press the I don't know if we should implement that , because it says that teletext not really important , # UI: but , the shortcut , and you can't go to sport . # ME: I think we should we could that we could also implement a audio settings , screen settings and channel settings , but as sub-menus . # ME: Mainly if you turn the remote control on , you have to u you have to see from one till zero , channel and volume . # ME: And if you want to use teletext screen or audio , then you can press it . # ID: just sub-menu . # ME: It should be available but not # UI: 'Cause it should be there . # ID: Not directly available . # PM: so not too much teletext support , but in a separate menu , # UI: So actually it is there but it's just not r ready there . # ID: Directly available . # ID: So does it confuse the user ? # UI: You'll have to search for it . # ME: They'd have to be easy to use . # ID: If you want to use teletext , you can push the teletext button and then the options become available . # ME: The sign of it . # PM: but no more buttons or functions , # ME: What else can you do with a television ? # UI: We've got anon # PM: Aren't we forgetting something very important ? # UI: Have got two examples here , but I don't think there's anything we're missing . # ME: play , pause , doesn't n need to be there . # UI: we don't have the video orders # ME: this is your presentation . # ME: We could check the other remote controls with technical functions . # UI: you could look here all the # ME: Which ones were yours ? # UI: th I don't know , technical functions . # UI: They're a bit small , you can we should stretch them , because # ME: Ja ja . Technical functions . okay . # UI: I guess we've got them all . # ME: I think I go to have volume , mute but I . Very slow . # ME: the zoom buttons . # UI: And for a T_V_ ? Can you zoom in a T_V_ ? # ME: wide screen , high screen , different things you have , # UI: Or that you can put 'em on wide and # UI: But that should also be a sub then , a sub menu thing . # ME: it should be available , but then in separate screen settings or something . # UI: so we should also implement se screen settings . # ME: screen settings , audio settings , teletext settings you have . # ME: Channel settings . # UI: so you can program the # ME: So those four , and of course the main . # UI: so the first you see the main , and the other ones you can go to # ME: Like tap screens or something or , I dunno . # UI: I hope we can do this . # ID: There are a lot of options depending on what kind of television you got . # ID: 'Cause if you don't got a wide screen television you don't need the screen settings # ME: you don't yu a no you then you don't no ni don't then you don't use it . # ID: and if the television does not support such operations # UI: We don't have to use that top . # ME: So you leave it alone . # ME: Or it could be possible to have a standard version of the remote , an expanded version . # UI: And do we want them in different colours , and the buttons , should they have colours ? # ID: Colours I think the main colour of the remote control is the colour of the L_C_D_ screen . # UI: but we don't have any buttons . # ID: I Because we don't want a lot a devi a device self s g # ME: then defines itself . # ME: Because how many percent ? # ME: Eighty percent ? # UI: They think it's ugly , # ME: Would spend more money if it looks fancy . # ID: so use very lot of peo # UI: Perhaps you can make adjustable fronts , like with the telephones . # ID: Adjust with phones , yes # UI: You can But I don't think that # ID: Twelve Euro fifty . # ID: make it available in different colours , you mean ? # ID: Red , white , blue , black . # PM: And a see-through # ME: Rasta colours . # ID: sea view , yes , Simpson's versions and # ME: see through version . # ME: If you press a button , it turns green . # PM: Okay , well that's the # UI: A disco version . # PM: signal for las final five minutes . # UI: Five minutes ? # PM: I have the things I just read . # PM: then we have separate menus for teletext , screen settings , audio settings , and what else ? # ME: Channel settings ? # PM: Channel settings . # UI: So you can program the T_V_ . # UI: Perhaps you should you'd throw them on in one pile . # UI: So , options , and then you sub them . # ME: Could be possible . # UI: Otherwise you have all those teletext , perhaps teletext not , # ME: Or like you have a menu button , you press # PM: we said teletext also a separate menu . # ME: or otherwise you have a menu button , press menu then you have main menu search all the all the settings . # PM: but we can work that out later , I guess . # ME: , no problem . Yep . # PM: we're having a general menu with the most used functions , teletext , screen settings , audio settings , channel settings , and maybe there are options for the remote itself ? Like large icons or small icons # PM: I don't know what else , # ME: I think b because we don't have a lot of buttons on the one screen , # UI: Or do we have any buttons ? On the remote . # ME: I think the buttons but or like you have # ME: you only have channel button or volume button . # ME: Those buttons you can you can # PM: but on the L_C_D_ , # UI: But that's also in the L_C_D_ , # UI: So we don't have any normal buttons # ME: No , no normal buttons , . # ME: Maybe only the on and o on and off button . # UI: Yet on and off is p is perhaps you kno # PM: But we don't need a special # ME: But I don't think # PM: we don't need a special options menu for the remote itself . # UI: Oh well , you should be able to set which T_V_ you have . # UI: If you have if you have # ID: sure , of course you need a settings button , or a settings option for the remote control . # UI: But isn't idea to use uh what you said , normal on and off button for the T_V_ , that you don't have to use a # ME: No no , because we discussed that you could charge it , otherwise is it jumps to stand-by mode automatically . # UI: but not for the remote but for the T_V_ , that you use # ME: but a T_V_ of course , th that's the I think that's a best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel . # UI: But a not as normal button , in the L_C_D_ , # PM: maybe there should be a separate button apart from the L_C_D_ , because you can't turn it on when the L_C_D_ is off . # PM: So how do you turn the thing on ? # PM: There has to be a on button on the remote , # UI: you just tap I think . # PM: Tap the thing . Okay . # ME: Touch screen , then it's turn off , turn on . # PM: And then the television is on also , or just the remote ? # ME: just the remote . # ME: A television don't have to be on , that one you can press on , # ID: it should be in standby mode , # ME: stand-by , then press on remote , press on and then T_V_ should be available . Or not . # UI: I don't know whether it's handy to have a n a normal on button , a r just rubber for T_V_ , # UI: so you can turn it on and then you can choose the channel . # UI: Otherwise you I don't know whether or not that's # ID: A normal button on the remote control , # UI: or you should put it in the L_C_D_ screen . # ID: because when you touch the L_C_D_ screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on . # ID: why would it be a need to have a normal button ? # UI: I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen , you first have to search where is the on button , then you then turn it , and then the T_V_ goes on . # UI: But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote , then you do the on , and then you search the channel which you want . # ME: but I think the re the remote control , if you press tap the screen , it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button , channel button , and of course of also the on and off button . # ID: I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use if you don't have any buttons on the s on remote control . # UI: , I think so too . # UI: Otherwise y wet e k . # PM: So actually we're going to create a button-less remote . No buttons at all . # PM: Okay , well that's might be a unique selling point , huh for a remote . # UI: If we can afford it . # PM: Okay , well I guess we have to # ME: , if we can afford it . # PM: postpone further discussion to our next meeting , because we're running out of time . # PM: for now , we're having a lunch break , and then there will be half an hour for the next share of individual work . # PM: I will write minutes , if I can create them out of this . # PM: And put them in the project documents folder . # PM: And here are the individual actions for the for the other roles . # PM: And of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your personal coach . # PM: Luckily as we are . # PM: Okay , well thank you very much , for now , and have a nice lunch , huh ? # UI: Should we put this back in our rooms ,
# PM: welcome everyone to our next meeting . # PM: I'm busy writing and busy leading the meeting , but I've prepared a little presentation once again or at least an agenda I think the biggest part of the presentation will be on your side . # PM: we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened . # PM: once again I will try to write some minutes which I just from the previous meeting placed inside our project folder , which was quite some typing . # PM: today we once again have three presentations , if I'm right , and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts . # PM: And just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that . # PM: Okay , well I'd say let's start with the first presentation . # PM: in the same order as last time ? # ID: welcome you all . # ID: Components design , first of all I would like to uh accommodate some of those things I uh elaborate some of the things I did . # ID: I elaborated on the concept . # ID: What should be said about the components , its properties and what kind of materials should we use to make one of those r remote controls . # ID: first of all I've d subtracted some of the components that is that are used are w you know from what the remote control's formed . # ID: first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the remote control . # ID: I would like to give you an idea of how I thought about . # ME: Don't destroy my giraffe . # ID: Giraffe's gone now . # ID: the case was is made from rubber , I suppose . # ID: There's one of the because when you use a remote control a lot of people will drop their remote control # ID: and they break the titanium was also an option . # ID: But it's a very expensive material . # ID: rubber is , I think , the best suitable material to use for our for our remote control . # ID: it's poss it's also possible to create fancy colours with rubber . # ID: rubber l makes it easy to it lets itself colour . # ID: titanium you have to paint it and with that it's possible to scratch it or make it ugly . # ID: rubber the total piece of rubber that's sor that's used to make the case is the same colour , so if you scratch it it's still the same colour , perhaps it's a little bit damaged . # ID: But it's a very strong material . # ID: I h I had an idea single covered curved , sorry , single curved . # ID: it's t two dimensional . # ID: I think it's best to draw # ME: Bright colour . Fancy colour . Forward . # ME: You have to go t # ID: Let's make it black . # ID: I thought of an idea like this . # ID: So it also looks nice when it's on your table . # ID: So you get it doesn't lay flat down on the table , but it's c it's stands . # ME: it's a side view . # ID: Side view yes it's side view I I'm not technically good at th three D_ modelling , it's just an idea I had so it's very so its also looks nice when it's on the table . # ID: the graphical user interface and the buttons , we also thought about that already . # ID: I thought about the L_C_D_ touch screen , which is easy to clean too . # ID: One of the great advantages of the L_C_D_ screen you just use some or another cleaning uh cl some cleaning stuff . # ID: And it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright . # ID: I already s explained some properties of that material and I think we also we almost concluded about that this should be our button component . # ID: that's all about the buttons . # ID: the batteries , we also thought about that already , will be chargeable with uh an option for a mount station so you can put the remote control in a mount station so its charges itself up instead of plugging it in or something like that . # ME: Just looking . # ID: And they should be long lasting , not be empty in about two minutes or thirty minutes or forty minutes of use . # ID: And next step is the chip th the component that's makes or transmits the signal to the television . # ID: there was an option to use s a rather simple chip but I think because of our highly requiring requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it with also the ability to facilitate speaker speech recognition which unfortunately is still in a test phase , there should be some more investigation on that side . # ID: my personal preferences I also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use our own business colours . # ID: That was correct , wasn't it ? # ID: I think they are rather boring for use with rubber . # PM: business colours I thought it was the slogan and the corporate image , so , it needs colour , # ID: they should be m sh they should be in mind , # PM: but I don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour . # ID: so it d it doesn't says to have the slogan ? # PM: It must be recognisable . # ID: that's possible of course . # UI: You can put the R_ and R_ . # ID: We could make a little R_ and R_ on the top of the machine . # ID: they are pretty boring , I suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours and also in a lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very fancy remote controls which peopl who people which people will find they're interesting . # ID: And will buy them faster when they look at the same old grey or black colours . # ID: s as I said before rubber is impossible to damage severely imp instead of course you can break it when you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that , but i if you drop it it's not broken right away s instead of using plastic , hard plastic or titanium . # ID: And I personally liked the single curved remote control , because it makes sense . # ID: Okay . Well that's all about my findings . # UI: I will go next . # UI: Alright so I thought a little bit about the interface . how it should look . # UI: And we determined that will not be no buttons , but only an L_C_D_ screen , so I had to look on that . # UI: And the design is therefore based on what we just uh thought of . # UI: first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition . # UI: And this is that uh you ask you give a question through the device and it answers you . # UI: And they already put this in an in a coffee maker . # UI: And so that it you say good morning , coffee maker , and it says t says to you back good morning Joe or what's your name . # UI: This and there's an easy way to program that you say record into the device into the speaker and then you say the question and three seconds later you say the answer and then when you say the question it gives you the answer . # UI: perhaps it's useful , perhaps for because people lose the remote , they can yell remote where are you and calls or something . # UI: And perhaps we could implement that . # UI: And then I have to go out of the presentation because I tried to make some kind of a idea of how it should look like # UI: but I can't draw , don't make too much of it . # UI: I tried to the L_C_D_ screen I tried to sort of to draw . # UI: I thought at least the icon for the volume . # UI: I don't know if there is an icon for the program , # UI: and then the buttons above and below the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon . # ME: Where's where's the button for two ? # UI: I forgot that one . # UI: I thought I forgot something , And and the numbers , that should be a bit larger I think it's not really on scale and so forth . # ME: Doesn't matter . # UI: an options button . # UI: And I thought the button for teletext apar apart because it's not really options , I think . # UI: It's options is the settings of the remote and of the T_V_ and that kind of thing . # UI: So could call it settings or something . # UI: But this is a bit how I thought it . # UI: And the L_C_D_ somewhere on the remote . # UI: Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should , so that it's better in your hand or something . # UI: But and a microph microphone for the speech recognition if we want to implement that . # UI: and then if you press the op options button , now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what you could do and that you could do with something like this . # UI: And it's also I thought think we discussed earlier that older people don't really want to use these extra settings . # UI: And older people a also don't really want to use this th this kind of option menus . # UI: So they want to u use one button and then something happens , and not choose with this kind of And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your remote , so you could scroll across these things . # UI: That's an option . # UI: And that was my finding # PM: Now our third # ID: Go Danny , go Danny . # PM: team member with his presentation . # ME: I'm going to tell you something about a trend watching . The trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours , material and stuff . # ME: The method I used was Like I told I watched the trends from the past years about colours , shapes , material they wanted from elderly and young people . # ME: So we can keep that in mind for designing f the device itself . # ME: Findings I made . # ME: The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look fancy . # ME: The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative , like the L_C_D_ screen that's quite innovative so that should be great meeting for this . # ME: And the third thing is it should be easy to use . # ME: I think with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use . # ME: The personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like banana yellow , strawberry red and stuff . # ME: The round shapes , and soft material m materials like the rubber . # ME: It should be soft i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things . # UI: Let's build it into a sponge . # ME: Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like woods dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff . # ME: They liked square shapes with round edges . # ME: And hard materials like wood , titanium . # ME: those kind of materials they liked . # ME: This is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours , innovative , all the colours you see , the blue , the red , the white , the yellow , that stuff . # ME: And then I th I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like this or something . # ME: It's it's a bit like a banana . # ME: And the colour should be yellow , or something . # ME: And for the elderly people just plain old . # ME: Because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs , or was it two colours ? # UI: It was one remote , I think , # ME: Different colours , . # UI: different colours . # ME: We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes . # ME: I think like my colleague , you said , is that's e better , or for the elderly people something like the iPod or something , with round squares . # ME: Simple but easy to use . # PM: So for the older people , a more traditional form . # ME: That is my like the older o older colours I can maybe # UI: You could you could change the colours , that was also the idea . # UI: I don't know which shape you should take , # ME: Colours th the elderly people # PM: I guess changing colours will be easier than changing # ID: Changing just the shape of the remote control ? # PM: the shape of it . # UI: Perhaps you could find something in the middle . # UI: Round but square . # ID: round corners , but s but square , . # PM: But maybe then both groups won't buy it . # UI: i if you do it uh square , with round corners but a little in the middle of it Do you know what I mean ? # ID: I know what you mean , kind of like a . # UI: like this a bit . # UI: So it's a bit square , but it's also a bit round . # ID: Kinda like a beer glass . # ID: I know what you mean . # ID: It's also easy to have to put in your hand . # UI: but that's also how other remotes are shaped , so that's But perhaps that's a good thing , so that's easy to use . # UI: People know the # ID: Will recognise that's as a remote control . # ME: Look something like that . Autumn colours like red , brown . # ID: when I saw your d # ME: They liked the wood a lot . # ME: So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look or something in that colour . # ID: kinda like old cars , # ME: And a bit old school style renaissance , medieval kind of things . # ID: Let's put it all together . # ME: Those kind of , those kind of things . # ME: So you see the big difference between the young people ? Fresh , exciting . # ME: And the old people , old and boring . # UI: But that's easily to do with the colour , I think . # UI: That's easy to do with the colours , I think . # ME: I think it's easier to do in colour than in shape . # PM: we think so too . # ME: Because otherwise we have to get different shapes , and colour way easier than the shapes . # ME: In material rubber , rubber is , like I said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones and the old people like plain wood . # ME: So we have to decide if we're going to use real hard rubber , or soft rubber . Or something between that . # UI: Also in between . # ME: soft rubber which you can you can feel in it . # ID: I know what you . # UI: I don't think you should be able to mould it , # ID: It should shouldn't be . # ME: Or or wh what's something harder . # ME: No no but you have to like a eraser or something . That's the bit you can press it in , or something harder . # UI: Bit like this kind of rubber . # ME: , something like this , . # UI: But it's quite hard , this . # ME: it's quite hard but you can press it in . # ME: It's feels kind s spongy . # UI: I don't think it's rubber . # PM: So we need a spongy feeling . # UI: did you have something about # ME: Are you going to invite Sponge Bob , maybe he can # UI: So we should first decide about shape , I think . # ME: I think that's the better thing to do . # UI: Then you can fit the L_C_D_ screen in it , and can decide . # ID: I also s can't help but notice that you used an you had a remote control and the L_C_D_ screen was rather small . # ME: w I think that L_C_D_ screen should be like # UI: it it's supposed to be bit s bit s bit # ID: This was your size , but I think it should be larger . # ME: three quarter of the of the # ID: , three quarters . # ID: So so you don't have to put your oh . # ME: the buttons won't get that small when the L_C_D_ screen is # ID: when you get this kinda like this . # ID: Or should it be larger ? # ME: Larger I think . # ID: Because you want to put your hands # UI: But if you pu Now you can put your hand there and then you won't touch the screen . # ME: becau because you have # UI: Perhaps that's best . # ME: okay , true , true , true . # ID: Your thumb here . # UI: But not on the screen because that's an idea . # UI: Looks a bit like a Game Boy now . # ID: Because when you put your f but if yo if you make the L_C_D_ screen as large as the remote control itself , you'll always get some # UI: You always touch it , # ID: Going to be very greasy and stuff . # ME: But it won't get that small because you have how much ? Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen . # ME: One to zero , the two digit , # ID: you don't want it too small . # ID: How how large # ME: You have to you have to Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time . # ID: they have thick fingers . # ID: But if you wanna make it in international , Japanese people got rather small hands and we got these large # ME: we have we have the zoom option , # ID: Zoom opt of course , You can make it larger to with accompanying greater fields to push the button . # PM: And we won't include a pen , or something to point , we want to do it with our fingers , # ID: Your fingers , . # UI: Y you could include a pen # ID: You don't want Because if you lose the pen if you lose the pen you can't use # ME: Use a pen You you c you can lose the pen . # PM: but I think people want to use a remote with their fingers because th they're used to that # UI: o , if they think it's handy to use a pen . # UI: I think this is a good size for the screen . # UI: I don't know how large the actual remote should be but a little bit like this , or something . # PM: And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , huh . # ID: You can do whatever any cloth . # ME: but that can be with plain soft tissue . # ME: you can buy those at # PM: maybe , if I can interrupt you , maybe I should show some points on which we should take a decision . # PM: So we can discuss these points . # PM: those points energy question mark . # PM: How how should we supply the thing with energy and how are we going to do it with separate docking station and then put in it . # PM: chip on print and case . # PM: Those are points my coach advised me to discuss here , but I hope you have ideas about them . # UI: I think energy were batteries and then and # ID: The docking station . # PM: So that's the first point . # ME: Maybe it's better to include rechargeable batteries # PM: We already decided that on the previous meeting . # ME: which you can recharge through the docking station . # UI: Just like with the telephone . # ME: if the badg the batteries are dead # ID: I kinda like your # ME: then you can re you can change them . # ID: you got some of those uh wireless mice ? Mouse . Computer mouse . # ID: Kinda like those kind of batteries . # UI: but it should be th I think normal batteries , not like two or two # ME: , normal plain normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . # PM: Simple rechargeable batteries . # UI: what was with the chip on print ? # ID: The chip on print ? # ID: you gotta f I think so . # ID: Chip on print with a with a simple a sim not a simple but a # ID: We also discussed that . # PM: but how did this how does that with a L_C_D_ screen ? # PM: You still have a print plate . # ME: You always have a print plate . # ID: Beg your pardon ? # ME: You always have a print plate , # ID: sure , of course , . # ME: Always , I dunno what w what we have to decide about that . # PM: it's a good question . # PM: It just was in there and I didn't have any information about it , # ID: chip on print , I think what they mean with the regular rubber buttons that you got , it's always clear for the remote control when you press a certain button . # ID: But when you got a L_C_D_ screen , with no with not the buttons are not always on the same place , for example if you enlarge a button , or if you got several options appearing on your screen , the co-ordinations aren't always the same . # ID: When you got a regular button , th the button of stand-by is always on the same place and you got on the and on the # ME: but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate , so that that's not of any discussion , I think . # PM: you need some kind of C_P_U_ , I guess . # ME: Mm , I don't I dunno I don't think that's # ID: It is a simple C_P_U_ but it doesn't # ME: but I d I don't know if nor o s it's quite a simple L_C_D_ . # ID: because it has to b # ME: , it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen . # ME: I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_ . # ID: but it the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just you just want to turn up the volume . # ME: , okay , true . True . # ID: So it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or C_P_U_ to know in which state you are and which button you are pressing in at the right moment . # PM: Because we're projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen . # ID: And a touch screen makes it possible to get the co-ordination of your finger on the screen . # ID: And the case , we already discussed the case , # ID: we wanted to make it from rubber # UI: but a hard rubber like this ? # UI: Or softer rubber # ID: hard rubber I think . # ID: That's the easy to ha to # UI: It bounces back from the floor where you throw it . # ME: We have different colours . # UI: this in different colours ? # ME: the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ? # ME: No I don't think , I think it's more round than square . # UI: But I think it should be a bit longer , perhaps . # ME: So it meets I think it meets more the young people than the older people . # PM: But that's what we want , . # UI: I think so too . # ME: , that's our target . # ID: It's our main target . # ME: Lower than forty years , I think # ID: and how about my idea of making it with one single curve ? # ME: that I think I thought that was a quite good # ID: Because it's a gadget and you want to show it off , of course . # PM: you have a fancy design , then , right away . # ME: You can put it on your table with the L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to put it get it in your hand , you can put it next to you and then dive it in # UI: , that's a good idea . # ID: It's a lot easier . # ID: Did you write that down ? # ID: got a single curved rubber f fancy coloured remote control . # ME: You can't you You can't you c you can draw it on your paper and then load it on the # PM: but I wrote it down . # UI: It's pretty easy # ME: And load it on the user the server . # PM: What about the user interface , there are also some questions about the concepts I think you have some ideas on that . # PM: You you showed your drawing . # UI: I had what I just I should again . # UI: I miss a few buttons , At least what we should also have on , I just remembered , a menu to go back through the first if you touch options , you can't go back to this right away now . # ME: you have to go back . # ME: Isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ? # ME: With the minus and the plus . # ME: I think it's easier than # UI: I thought it was easier to handle this way , but I don't know what they think . # UI: Would you like the buttons horizontal or v vertical ? # ME: For sound and channel . # ID: Depends on the screen . # ID: If you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter . # ID: If you make it in a rectangle # UI: Right well if we make it like this , I think if you # UI: put it like this # ME: I think it's easier to have it something like Oh a button minus here , plus over here . A minus here , plus over here . # ME: The other buttons and on here the top . # ME: The options and then you have something like the P_ over here , # UI: But I think I wou # ME: and the sound . # UI: I think that's a matter of what you're used to . # UI: I think I would put a plus and a min here . # UI: And then the P_ in the mid in the middle and the sound in the middle . # ME: Something like # ID: Take your time . # ME: Plus minus plus # UI: but I think when you are holding it , you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus . # ME: I think you're going to s you're going to use it with one thumb . # UI: but I think I don't know . # UI: Perhaps I have some examples . # ID: We'll leave that to the usability engineering then . # ME: Who's the usability engineering ? # UI: But I'm going to look if I've got some examples 'cause perhaps you should choose what's most often used . # UI: 'Cause they can use that better . # ID: Consistency . # ME: I have that those s numbers . # UI: I Here is our here are # ME: Or a good watch . # UI: I don't really know . # PM: Everybody's searching in his data . # ME: Channel selection . Per hour one hundred and sixty eight . # ME: Volume selection four times an hour # UI: but But I mean if it's usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote . # ID: So not how much n not how often it's used , but # UI: W what's usual or normal . # ME: that depends on the remote . # UI: I'm looking here . # UI: But here's it's below , here also , and now here's next to each other . # ME: I think because I have two televisions at home . # ME: One is horizontal , one is vertical , # ID: it does it doesn't really matter , # ME: so it depends . # UI: I think the volume was usually above each other , because you go higher and down . # UI: And the pay the program is next to each other , because you would go further and back . # UI: That's how it's is usually when I look here that's what I see . # ID: Let's cut to the chase . # ME: It's got to change . # PM: I think we have we don't have to decide about that now where we will put the buttons # ME: is it is user interface . # UI: This concept is in the actual design , but you should know where you would place a # ID: Okay , well . Interface , . # UI: And the speech shall we implement that ? # PM: we just heard about the new technology , huh ? # ID: Technologies , . # ME: I think it's easy for that , where are you , but then it says I'm here . # UI: But then you should also find a place # ID: Makes it possible to # UI: You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something . # UI: You can talk into the corner . # ME: , a microphone , . # ID: Not even necessary , because a lotta you can make a very sensitive microphone , so it makes it possible to just put it arou underneath it or on the on the bottom of the remote . # PM: maybe at the bottom where you can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone # UI: in the middle or something . # ID: But that's not import I think that's not im very important because , it doesn't matter where the microphone is . # UI: but you should decide where you want to put it . # ID: okay , sure , okay , # ME: I think where it isn't seen # ID: Indeed . It shouldn't be very visible . # UI: You could p you could put it in a logo of the company . # PM: maybe just in the spot you just pointed out # ME: between the round of the R_ . # PM: because I think it should be in a in an important position where people can see it , because it is the unique idea of our remote , huh , the speech control . # UI: where do you want to put it ? # PM: maybe where the one hand # ID: but it doesn't makes it any more fancy because you get to see # UI: actually it does because it you can you can find it better if you use it . # UI: It's a way for you to So it makes more sense just 'cause other remotes don't have that . # PM: But are we talking about the button , or about the microphone ? # UI: About a microphone , # PM: because a microphone is very small thing , # UI: there is no button . # PM: but you can make it look like it's big so as its really an important function of the remote . # ME: I think the left s under corner should be the best . # ME: Where isn't i it isn't most in sight . # ID: Okay . Well put it there . I don't mind . # ID: That doesn't really matter . # ME: No . Actually doesn't . # ID: Interface type . # PM: type , supplements , anything . # PM: we already s discussed that , huh , the L_C_D_ # ID: The L_C_D_ , supplements well the supplement is to # ME: I think I thought the , like you said , like scroll next to the remote isn't that handy . # ME: I think it's better to just up what you'd like to do on the screen . # ME: If you want to go back you have to back button go back , if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s sub-menu . # UI: the young people do like scroll # ID: Use the scroll . # ID: I think so too . # ME: You do like it ? # ID: So why not , on side . # UI: Or at least I don't know if it's really the scroll , but the menu they like most , and I think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll # ID: if you've got a settings , if you # ME: I think it is faster . # ME: I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options , but if you don't have a lot of option then # UI: But you have it's f # ID: You have a lot of options , # UI: we have five or four or something . # ID: because when you use you get w when you use the settings menu for example to look up some uh some channels on your on your television , you should scroll down on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen . # ID: So then it's very handy to scroll down , you make just a rubber just like on your mouse or . # ID: Just put it on the side and it's very easy to use . # ME: Okay , no problem . # PM: And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side which you can touch # UI: It's also different . # PM: Okay . Well there's our five minutes warning . # PM: any more questions about the design or the user interface or different components , everyone ? # ME: colours are clear , # PM: Everybody think they can # ME: shape is clear , material is clear . # ID: what's the standard colour ? # PM: work for that ? # ME: And a standard , # PM: Is there a standard colour ? # ME: we don't we have different colour . # ID: You got you got different colours , # ME: How many colours are we going to # UI: You should you should have a black one # ID: but you should have a standard colour . # UI: because I think black is standard . # ME: Black . , black I think is the standard . # ID: With the with the yellow # UI: But if you want to be different , then # ME: Dark grey , something like this colour or something . # ID: Just a regular remote colour . # ID: And then have different covers to use . # ME: I think it's better to have silver nowadays . # ME: I think you see more silver than black . # ID: You see a lot of t silver televisions . # PM: But still silver and black are # UI: Silver rubber . # ME: the silver black are our main colours . # PM: silver is new but also traditional , # ME: I think we have silver , black and between those is like I dunno s five colours between them or something . # PM: w what about a yellow thing , I mean it # ID: y I think it's better to # ME: it'll be a banana yellow , we have . # PM: could be ugly , but it's definitely fancy . # ID: th . That's right . # ID: But if you use silver , rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy . # ME: Green , wood , brown . # ID: When you use titanium , silver is fancy , but when you use silver rubber , it isn't fancy . # ID: Silver has to shine , and rubber doesn't shine . # ID: Especially when it's made of soft rubber like this . # ID: You understand ? # ME: , I understand . # PM: I would think about colours like red , yellow , green , blue , # ME: The fruity colours and the autumn colours , like red and brown , dark red and brown . # UI: Just all kind of colour . # ID: Fruity loops . # UI: And and do we have to have a normal black one , or # PM: Who's pinging ? # PM: You are pingin I thought we # PM: Okay , so that wraps it up ? # PM: Everybody knows what to do ? # PM: I wrote it down here . I wrote it down here what to do . # UI: I don't know what to do , # ID: not what to do . Not what to do . # PM: The next meeting is once again in thirty minutes . # PM: here are the individual actions , and especially notice that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board , and of course to all four of us specific instructions will be emailed by our personal coach . # ME: We'll be available . # UI: But do we have to We'll work together , but do we have to stay here , or do we # PM: I I'd say just wait for email and find out . # ID: Thin I think we should work . # PM: Okay well that was what I had to say , # PM: final thoughts from anyone , We're finished . # PM: Okay , well thank you very much . # ID: Thank you very much . # UI: we have to keep talking English now ? .
# PM: So well welcome everyone . # PM: as you may have noticed I created separate folders because it was tending to get a little busy in our shared project documents folder . # PM: I don't know if everybody put their own documents in the right folder , which is for now the detailed design meeting . # ME: That's new one ? # UI: We didn't make any # ID: we should save that one . # PM: Then I'll move this one . # UI: Didn't we just do that ? # ID: save in the folder . Save as project . # PM: this is just one big document , so you can leave that wherever it is . # PM: And we have a evaluation left here . # PM: not main documents this time . # PM: I have it open myself I guess . # PM: the detailed design meeting Huh ? # PM: We're finally getting somewhere hopefully . # PM: what are we going to do ? # PM: I've opened it already . # PM: I'm still going to take some minutes , and if I'm right , you two are going to give a prototype presentation ? # PM: And m did you do something with evaluation criteria ? # PM: And we have a correct agenda . # PM: And then we have to look at something which is less nice , the finance aspect , whether we can afford what we have designed , and if we can we can commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation , how did we work together and what are the results , and how happy are we with those . # PM: Okay , well finance will be later . # PM: Now I'd like to give the word to you two . # ID: Get up stand up . # UI: we made a prototype . # UI: We first start with the overall This is about the total remote control . # UI: We made it green . # ID: Just example colour , there's one of the colours we would like to see in our prototype . # UI: It's a fresh colour . # UI: And the screen light blue . # UI: this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under . # UI: And the R_ and R_ logo , it just says R_ and R_ now , Any questions so far ? # ME: Big microphone . # ID: just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible . # ME: That's the place where it's going to be , not the size . # UI: perhaps you should make it a bit big , so people know it's there # ID: Do not forget it . # ID: To function it doesn't really have to be sm big of course . # ME: , okay . Of course . # ID: The microphone could be just a minor hole on the left button . # ID: we also made some ideas about how the options menu would work . # ID: using the scroll button on sides y I # UI: You push the scroll button # ID: , you push the scroll button # UI: and it's claps out if there's a # ID: and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and you get you get the options becoming available . For example T_V_ settings , remote settings , et cetera . # UI: Remote settings , et cetera . # ID: So you can scroll down too with the scroll button , as you can see it's here , just push it in , the menu comes out like this and i it all becomes visible . # UI: And you could also touch it so that it comes out , # UI: and use the scroll thing as a with your fingers . # ID: it's also nice to see that we made a small menu , the options menu becoming available when pressing the scroll button , and the opportunity to use the teletext , whi which is used which should still be used and we think that it's very handy to put it not under the options menu , but in Yes . In an apart # PM: a separate button for text , # ID: In a separate button , . # UI: Perhaps we should use the teletext sign # ID: just like Okay , indeed . # ID: we can modify that later . # ID: Would you like to make any comments about next # UI: this is the total interface that f of the L_C_D_ screen . # UI: the numbers , which is pretty straight forward . # UI: We put ano an extra button in . # UI: We can erase it , but It's the button where you can switch channels . # UI: just when you are one and you go to two , you can or if you go to five , you can go back to one with that button . # ID: Previous page , indeed . # UI: And uh we put that in , # UI: I thought it would be handy there . # UI: this the one number or two numbers button . # UI: Below that , the page and the sound . # UI: And in the middle the mute . # UI: battery indicator . # ID: It's quite large . # UI: It's it's a bit big . # UI: And this is the on off knop , the stand by knop . # UI: Or at least it should look like it . # UI: And the options of teletext . # ID: You can see very clearly now that the teletext and options menu isn't taking much it's taking much part of the screen , so it's very when you when you use it , doesn't become irritating to see . # ID: 'Cause if you put it on the top you always get see the options menu . # ID: 'Cause people regularly read from left top to right down , # UI: this about it , I think . # UI: I will put it back on the on the nice green . # PM: And I just missed when I was typing The R_R_ stands for ? # UI: That's the logo of the # UI: It's th right now it's only R_ , but # PM: I would have recognised it if it were the right colours of course . # PM: the evaluation criteria , # UI: Oh full screen , . # ME: my task was this time to put up a questionnaire by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users . # ME: My name , my job , # ID: My name , my job . # ME: Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false , like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's true or it's false by steps . # ME: One means absolutely not true , seven means true . # ME: The three important things of refa are from th of this year is are , # ID: you used the PowerPoint # ME: is the remote control fancy enough , is it in innovative enough , and is it easy enough to use . # ME: And then evaluation itself . # ME: First question . # ME: Is the design fancy enough ? # ME: Project Manager , what do you think ? # PM: it's looks fancy , especially with the green colour . And the curves which we decided , # PM: Only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting ? # UI: It oh it's in the background . Oh . # ID: the single curved idea was # UI: Y you should make a sideways view . # ID: . The sideways view , that ma # UI: It will be , I guess . Oh , we can # ID: not that pen . Not that pen . # UI: g I would smart board . # PM: it might work one time , huh . # UI: can I draw here or # UI: it would be something like this from the side , but with a bit of curve here , # ID: , that's the single curve indeed . # UI: if you v flip it like this . # ID: That's not very i it's also very handy if you make a side curve way to make the remote control very thin at the bottom at a bottom at a bottom . # ID: make it rather thick on the top , because on the top it has the screen , which takes in some space , and the batteries can be located over there , # UI: you just make the back of this part a bit bigger , so that it lays a bit o # ME: Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top ? # UI: , that's a bit of problem maybe . # ME: With two batteries , the whole print plate and t and top , and if you're holding it quite a lot I think # UI: I think , the battery should be in here , because it's just nothing , so if you could # PM: but we have to rate these things now ? # UI: 'Cause otherwise I think i # ME: , we have to rate . # ME: Is it fancy enough ? # ME: True is one , false is seven . # ME: fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people . # UI: I think it does . # UI: I if you don't make it green , then the elder people won't like it . # ID: It's pretty fancy . # ME: I think , I have to agree , all the colour colours don doesn't matter that m that much now , # ME: it's only design . # UI: I think it does . # ME: And the design . # PM: I think especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also . # UI: I don't know whether older people will use it , but # PM: Very new thing . # PM: Fancy the old people will . # UI: I would make it a two or something . # ID: It's true , it's a one . Very fancy . # UI: Alright , it's a one . Oh it's a one . # PM: Little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves , # ME: I n used I wouldn I should use that one , but it doesn't # ME: Okay , no it's two ? # ME: Very true , is it very true or isn't that true ? # PM: I'd say two on a scale # UI: they think it's very true , # ID: It's very true , because we designed it to be very fancy , # ID: It's very fancy , I think . # UI: We should perhaps # ID: Have you ever seen a remote control like this ? # PM: okay well , that's true . # ME: That's fancy enough . # PM: That doesn't matter that much , so make it a one . # ME: Let's give it a two . # ME: Is it innovative ? # UI: because it has an L_C_D_ screen , a mi microphone . # ID: And uh the scroll is rubber , # UI: It's from rubber . # ME: We have for the search function . # ID: Eno enough to I think . # ME: The scroller a bit I think it's a one . # UI: It's a one I think . # ME: Also huh uh-huh the buttons , are they easy to find ? # ME: That was a big requirement of the old people . # UI: because they're right on your screen . # UI: So you can use the b the arrows . # UI: They're right on your screen , so I don't know where you'd search . # ID: With the ones # ME: Are all the buttons easy to find ? Not only this buttons , all the buttons . # UI: I think they are . # UI: The options are it little bit harder , but if you touch the options then it's # ID: Take a harder look , # ME: I think th it's # ID: It's easier than the regular remote control . # PM: and you use these buttons the most , # ME: I think this is easy now . # ME: I think th I think the options buttons are not the easiest way to # UI: No they're not , but they're they are easy to find . # ID: , they are a lot easier to find than th than on the regular remote controls # ME: I would rate it a # ID: where you have to find out what which sign or icon means on every button . # ME: , okay , that's true , that's true . # ID: So you have t you have to use the manual to understand most # ME: But that's vantage of L_C_D_ screen , you can have text . # PM: which number are we going to fill in ? # ID: I think it's a two , at least . # UI: you can make it a two . # PM: Two , three and # ID: It's not perfect , but # PM: what do you think ? # ME: I think it's a three . # PM: Okay , so we have two , two , three . # ID: And why is that ? # ME: I personally think , because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use , it has to be easy to find right away . # ME: I think if you have the button at the right , I don't think you can find the option button that easy . # UI: but you don't have t have to use the button on the right . # UI: You can touch it . # ME: You can touch it . # UI: You you can touch options . # ID: It said bo both the options . # ME: but you have y then you have here s written option on here , the teletext button , Okay , then okay , good . # ME: Then I think also two , . # UI: You can touch options # UI: and it's comes out . # PM: because we have to # UI: The the Below . # PM: It's the box below it , # ID: the next question the next question . # PM: Otherwise we have two results in one question . # UI: It's different . # PM: next question . # ME: It's easy to use , as well for younger as elderl elderly people . # UI: For young people I think it's easy to use . # ME: Young means sixteen to forty years . # ME: And elderly from forty eight to their death . # ID: I think it's the most useful remote control ever to be manufactured . # UI: In the entire mankind . # PM: you're very enthusiastic about your own design , # ME: Also if you're sixty years old # ID: but because it has the regular controls , as you can see in the screen now , you don't have all the other options always on your screen . # ID: So it's t I think it's really easy to use . # ID: You want these options to # PM: As well for the for the older people ? # ME: , as well as your if you're fif sixty years old , you're holding one of those things in your hand # UI: but they don't want the extra options , # ME: but we're going to th make this f for a all kind of people , # PM: And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ? # ME: so it has to be # UI: but so they could I think it is . If they read a manual . # PM: Because that might # ME: If you read the manual , # ID: Perhaps that is one of the most # PM: M maybe that's the most user friendly and easy to use . # UI: Because it it's not it's not it's not difficult . # ID: because a lot of # UI: You say you say record to the to the speech recognition , # ID: Channel one , channel four , # UI: then you say the question and the answer . # UI: And that's everything it does , the speech recognition . # PM: maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them . # UI: I think it would make it # ID: , I think it does . # ID: Because all the people who can't # UI: I would make it two . # ID: a two . Sure , two . # ME: Not a seven for this ? # ME: I would also say three . # PM: Okay , so we have three two So what are we going to do ? # UI: Two and a half . # PM: Another question . # ME: Remotes overwhelmed with buttons . # UI: But I mean , that's definitely one . # ME: Tha that's a one , I think , that's definitely a one . # ID: That's definitely our # UI: Oh nee , oh seven is it ? # UI: the remote score . # PM: but I think you should make it one scale with one being good and seven being bad , # ME: I think isn't , this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed . # PM: because otherwise we can't calculate anything from the results , # UI: It's not overwhelmed . # PM: because we designed for that , # ME: Remote control has colours that different that meet different target groups . # UI: 'Cause we make them in different colours , so that they # PM: and I though w we had about single colours , # PM: but you can also make a wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing , # UI: That it that it looks like wood , like something , . # ME: Also with rubber ? # UI: I think you can . # PM: Whether it looks like wood , it isn't w it isn't wood # UI: It it feels like rubber , # PM: You can make a print on rubber , can't you ? # PM: So that's a one then , # UI: but then when you scratch it does come off . # UI: So that's a bit # ID: it is it is harder to # PM: Do you have many questions ? # PM: but we have We also We have to get to the money . # ID: We're getting paid . We're getting paid . # ME: The material used is spongy , that that's a one , that's m rubber . # UI: , it's very spongy . # ME: I th think it's not the most spongy thing . # UI: but not it's not very spongy , because it's hard rubber . # UI: I think it's a three . # ID: it's a three , because you want to make it rather flexible but not too flexible , # UI: Hard but You can break it . # ID: because it has a L_C_D_ screen . # ME: Remote control is hard to lose . # ID: it sh and it's easy to find . # UI: you could you could call it . # ME: Y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old . # ME: If first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust set the microphone , and then you lose it , then you have lost it . # UI: , y you can lose it , but it isn't hard to lose . # ME: It isn't hard , no . # ME: I think I think this is a two , personally . # UI: That it's hard to lose ? # UI: it is there's the # ID: Isn't hard to lose . # PM: so isn't hard to lose you . # UI: it's a six , you think ? # ID: Isn't hard to lose , # ME: Isn't hard to lose . # UI: , you can lose it , so I don't # ME: You can't lose it . # UI: you can make it a three I It does have an a built in function . # ME: Or if you're sixty years old , your demands # PM: but a har A hard to lose is good . # PM: So it should this question should be hard to lose . It's difficult to lose it . # UI: Hard to lose . Oh right . # ID: this is hard to lose . # UI: It is hard to lose . , so then this is it is almost true , # ME: I think , I think also . # ID: And most all because of the option to # PM: That happens above also . # PM: But maybe when you scroll away and back it will be normal , # ID: put the cor cursor on the . # ME: Remote control mainly be sold to younger people . # UI: I think it will , # ME: No , I don't think very true because the colours . # ME: We have the colours . # ME: we have the buttons is aren't that much . # ME: the material isn't that # UI: It's it's much more younger . # ID: So ma make it make it a two . # ME: I don I think I think it's a three . # PM: I think it's a lower number , so better because w we designed it for young people especially , didn't we ? # UI: I think it's a two # PM: What do you think ? # ME: I think because # ID: A two ? I think it's two . I think it's two too , two too . # UI: Let's make everything a two . # ME: In the features ? # PM: Dissatisfy younger people . # UI: Younger people . # ME: Because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing . # UI: that it doesn't . # ID: n not exactly but uh if it had some games on it or something like that , but it's for a remote control I think it i it would satisfy those needs . # UI: I think they like the speech . # UI: You could call to your # ID: the speech possibility , # UI: and the screen , # ME: L_C_D_ screen and scroll . # ID: Scroll options , . # ME: I think they'll be quite met with their expectations . # PM: but those are more fancy functions , not really many features or something . # PM: It has relatively few features , # UI: those are features . # ME: It's three features , basically , the L_C_D_ touch screen is feature . # ME: The microphone is a feature . # UI: aren't the features the microphone's feature and that you can change the channel's feature , and that you can change the volume is feature , and that you can change the options of the remote , uh something like that . # PM: Ours had other features with # ME: I think and then you have the audio settings , channel setting , video settings . # ID: The easy volume up button . # UI: Those are features . # ID: Remote younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume . Turn turn up the volume . # UI: Enough features ? # ME: So I've chos I shou I think it's a one . # ME: Personally , I think once you've 'cause you have the channel features you have the screen features , audio features , you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , L_C_D_ screen extra , scroll thing extra . # PM: you think one , what do you think ? # UI: I think two or three . # PM: I'd say three , so two it is then # UI: a two a two . Just another two . # ME: Make it make it a two . # ID: One two three . # ME: Or make it a fucking two . # ME: You can see the remote control is R_ and R_ . # UI: , there's R_ and R_ in front . # UI: it's not the colour , so maybe you should make two , but it has R_ and R_ . # ME: do did have nah y you have the black one . # ME: And we'll probably make also a yellow one . # UI: but not R_ and R_ yellow I think . # PM: but the logo is on the front , # UI: One d on i it's the colours and the # ME: And the menu is avail that is available is easy to use . # UI: I think it is , but I don't know what you think . # ID: I think it's easier to use than a regular remote control , because when you push on the options menu , you get the various options entirely explained . Entirely explained . # ME: , tha that's so true . # ID: Instead of just finding out what an icon means on a button . # UI: And you can navigate easier , because wi with the you have to push the arrows and with a normal T_V_ remote . # ID: , you can navigate . # ME: I think that wou that would be quite hard to learn to use it . # ID: You're not satisfied , Let's start over again then . # ME: , I'm not convinc . # UI: Let's make a different remote . Well # ME: Let's go th for inhalation of air] I think it would be a t , two . # PM: Oh , well that's pretty good , # UI: We only have twos . # UI: just twos . One three and a few ones . # ME: So okay , we have one three , a one , that have to got up . # UI: We m mostly have twos , so it's pretty good . # ME: So two , . The average is a two . # ME: That is quite good # UI: I think so too . # ME: in my opinion . # UI: We can be happy . # UI: It's like a bug or something . # UI: A f butterfly . # PM: That was your evaluation show , okay , so we don't have to calculate anything because of these results . # ME: it's two . The average is two . # PM: let's see it isn't asked to save but it did already # ME: I uh I saved it . # PM: And this Everything okay . # PM: the next part might be a little bit difficult to do in a group , but I am willing to try it . # PM: Because we are going to look at the finance and I have a nice Excel sheet to do that . # PM: And I'm not sure if I put it in the project folder . # PM: and we're going to calculate the production costs , and if they are under or at twelve Euro fifty , we're good , and if they're not we're going to re-design , but we have to do that very quick I think , # UI: So we're going to erase features or something . # PM: don't know if I # UI: Do you have the cost # PM: put the Excel sheet in the # ME: f fifty five Euros . # PM: folder . I think it's # UI: We're going to be here at eight o'clock . # PM: I think it's still in my own documents folder . # UI: We're goin still going to be here at eight o'clock . # UI: Perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the Excel sheet . # ME: The microphone . # UI: it was in my information , # ID: It i It wasn't too much . # ME: maybe you're going scrap it . # ID: As well as the L_C_D_ screen . # PM: Okay , well this is it . # UI: if it doesn't work # PM: maybe I could ask one of you to fill it in , so that I can also take minutes , # UI: I want to fill it in , but # PM: and maybe the other can use that thing to count numerous functions . # UI: But you should direct # ME: Li like write it be # PM: we have to count some things and we have to think about some things . # PM: But you have to fill in this column , huh ? # ID: You got Excel to count . # UI: The number of # PM: count number of functions , because for every button you have to pay # PM: and there are different screen shots , so or different screens , # ID: Danny , Danny , I'll do that , # ME: Huh ? Oh , yea , you design it . # ID: because I draw the # UI: We've got a battery , one or t two batteries , or not ? # UI: one battery , with two small batteries . # PM: but it's more about the energy source , Do you use a hand dynamo , a battery , kinetic or solar cells ? # UI: I would do a battery we do . # UI: A battery . One battery , # ID: No , no solar cell , no . # ME: it took a battery ? # ID: No hand dynamo . # UI: Electronics , simple chip # UI: advanced chip , # ME: we have sample speaker . # ID: On advanced chip . # ME: But b al but we also have sample speaker , do # UI: so this one and this one . # UI: we ha we have single # ME: we already on nine . # ME: We have double curved . # ID: Single nee single curved . # ID: Double curved was uh see ju three dimensional . # ID: But it isn't three dimensional , # ID: it isn't curved in a l # UI: it's not going to work people . # UI: We have rubber . # ME: This one is curved like this , # PM: I'll just fill it in . # ME: It's curved like this . # PM: rubber indeed ? # ID: single curved is like this . # ID: that's the only curve you made , # ID: not th curved like that . # ME: but we have curves like it and it . # ME: There are two curves , Oh , okay I understand , I understand . # UI: With a scroll wheel , Is he integrated ? # ME: No , we don't have push button . # ID: we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button , because when you push it and you w it won't just pu makes possible to s # UI: Oh , right , we want it to it's not it's not no . # ID: Not going to work ? # UI: Fifteen , oh , too bad . # UI: but with special colour we have . # UI: A special form , # ID: But now button supplements . # ID: We don't got the button supplements . # UI: we don't have any buttons , # ME: Eighteen and a half , # ME: We have to lower it with six points . # UI: we have fifteen and # ME: Twelve and half . # UI: We could lose the curve . # UI: , I would lose the curve . # ID: We could lose the scroll wheel . # ID: You could make it just a regular scroll wheel . # UI: But you can't push it , so you have to tap . # ID: if you can't push it you have to tap the options window button here and then scroll down with the d with the button . # PM: I think that will be our best bet . # UI: So normal scroll wheel ? # ID: Normal scroll wheel . # UI: And I think we should lose the curve . # ME: I think we should scrap the sample speaker . # ME: It's four pri it four units . # UI: but if you would i it is a new feature , it it's something special . # ID: Okay , so we don't exactly need the single We don't need a curve . # UI: the curve doesn't really # ID: 'S possible to lose curve . # ME: Curved then it will be square . # UI: then it will won't stand up from the table . # UI: Then it would just # ME: Was that does that mean to it , single curve ? # ID: , that's meant with scr with s curve . # ID: The curve is in a dimension . # ID: If you make it a flat one , s n it's no curve , you got no curves . # UI: We would lose this one ? # ME: but tha that only is one . # UI: we could s , a bit . # UI: Sixteen point three . # ME: we also have to # ID: Is it possible to make # UI: Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ? # ME: otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen . # UI: Ma y you just can't do that , or # PM: And what did you change ? # PM: You changed the scroll wheel # UI: We changed th and the single curved to uncurved . # ME: Single curved . # PM: but it's just one # ME: so that does doesn't that mu I think # PM: so maybe you should # ME: Scrap sample speaker ? # PM: you should you should drop the speech recognition . # ID: The sample speaker is two d wait , f s four points . # ME: Yes , four points . # PM: And then you can keep the curve . # UI: but it is it is a new feature , # UI: it is something special . # ID: becau when you lose the # ME: but what else what else do you want to scrap ? # ME: You have to we have to scrap four points . # UI: that's difficult . # PM: Or make it on a hand dynamo , but I don't think that will work . # ME: Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ? # ID: Make it w when you made it uh a remote control of wood ? # UI: We could make it titanium instead of rubber . # ID: You don't make a remote control of . # ME: it also it also takes one point less . # PM: but a wooden remote control only helps for old people we discussed , # UI: can I ask something ? # UI: What is special colour ? # UI: Is that the wood # UI: this , we have to have that one too ? # PM: but it's only a half . # PM: But I think the only option is to drop the sample speaker . # ME: Sample speaker . # ID: To knock the sample speaker , . # ID: And sample sensor . # UI: Th then we still have too much if we use the # ME: three . Point three . # UI: we scrap that one ? # ID: What we'll have . # ID: Let's make it thirteen or fourteen . # ME: Point twelve . # UI: three . We need point three . # ME: That's a scroll wheel . # UI: Don't make it wood . # ME: we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood . # UI: but it's special colour , a all kind of colours ? # ID: special colours , fruity colours . # UI: It's also green # ME: Is it also no that that's just normal colour fruit colours . # UI: but it's a special colour than just rubber colour . # ME: Normal colours , yellow # UI: You have to add something to the rubber to make it green . # UI: You don't say here's green rubber . # ID: They don't sell green rubber plants . # ME: but then I d I don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half . # UI: , you can , you should you have to lose # ME: But then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display , we have to scrap # UI: it is the scroll wheel , I guess . # ME: s advanced chip . # ME: then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make ? # ID: If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally depending dependent on the touch screen # ME: Then we have two . # ID: then it's possible to make . # ID: And then you can and then you can add to the colours . # ME: Then we can make add two colours on it . # ME: two colours it . # UI: Switch colours . # ID: if you lose if you lose the # UI: It was such a great idea . # ID: You lose this one , you got eleven point five # ME: They can add two colours . # ID: and you make i and then you can make the spec single curve , for example . # ME: But the colours . how ma the colours like l she told , is that all the colours we add # ID: How d uh how many colours ? # UI: What do you mean ? # ID: Special colours , all the colours you want , because you want to make p # ME: but we are we have yellow , red , black , titanium . # ID: but when you use more than one colour , it's a special colour . # UI: But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour , # UI: 'cause you have to add it . # ME: but the rubbers alls original black . # UI: so you always lose the special colour . # UI: You co you could make it always black , like normal remote . # ME: but we're gonna make it yellow red , and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now . # ID: we also want to make ano another colour . # UI: we should u We have to make this like four or five or something . # UI: That's what it means . # ME: because we have more colours than only black . # PM: but isn't it per remote that you pay ? # ME: I then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special # UI: Is it per remote ? # PM: I think you pay half per remote . # PM: So each remote with a special colour . # UI: and you one colour per remote . # UI: So then it is one . # ID: You don't need four of those four of those special colours in one in one remote . # ME: , okay , true . True , true . # ME: We have two points spare . # PM: we have advanced chip on print . # UI: So it would be curved , single curve . # PM: Because of thing , well you can at least make it curved again . # UI: y you just can't make a nice remote . # ID: , single curve . # PM: Because that was very important , # UI: It's too bad for the speaker . # PM: it's curved , it's still that we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker . # UI: Should we change that tha that that's a one if not , # PM: We dropped the scroll wheel . # UI: Could you copy it ? # PM: And the rest is the same , # ME: Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped . # UI: The entire Perhaps you can then copy page or so . # UI: you made the entire could you Would you ? # ID: Twenty minutes ? # UI: Perhaps you can save this one , and then copy or something . # UI: Add it copy page . # UI: Alright , something went wrong . # PM: but this new remote we can afford . # UI: It doesn't work . # ME: It should've work . # ID: Okay , so you had this list at start ? # ID: When did you receive this list ? # PM: I just received it . # PM: They don't work so hard at the finance department . # ID: I suppose this is a # ID: Okay , so we lose the scroll wheel , # UI: The microphone . # ID: And the microphone . # UI: A and we changed something , I guess , # PM: Twelve Euro fifty . # PM: and did you try to make a new design , or what were you trying to do ? # UI: I tried to copy that one , but it didn't work . # PM: It didn't work . # UI: So we could fix it like tha that it's like this . # UI: You could select it all , but then you can't erase . # PM: Oh , you can arrange # ID: You can only re erase ? # UI: When you saw th li Earlier when we selected it , w I couldn't erase anything . # PM: , can't you then just say copy ? # UI: Just tap somewhere . # ID: just up somewhere b besides it , # ME: just tap somewhere . # PM: and now you can erase . # UI: I don't think I can , but we can try . # ID: , we already try . # PM: it should be possible . # PM: you can draw over it with white pen . # UI: we tried it earlier . # UI: It's very much work . # PM: but that's also useful for the evaluation , because I think we have a prototype now # ME: Evaluation drops . # PM: which we can afford and we only need to draw a little bit to get a good design . Doodle . # PM: And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time . # ME: And erase the mic . # ID: All I need is no mic . # PM: Let's see , we can save this now . # UI: I already erased half of the line . # PM: And move back to here . # UI: Still looks nice . # PM: And then all green . # PM: Okay , well thank you . # ME: Looks like a iPod . # PM: but you can erase that . # UI: that's a bit weird . # ID: S Difference between lines and text and the pen . # ME: All I need is mic . # PM: And you can't erase this ? # PM: just leave it at this and quickly save . # ME: Station page . # PM: and then we are going to the project or product evaluation . # ID: looks fucking boring now . # PM: We just did our project evaluation . # PM: I think I can sit for that since it's almost my final slide . # PM: what did you think about the process ? # PM: How satisfied are we ? # ID: Deadlines were sometimes very short . # UI: Bu but stressful . # UI: You think , no , my presentation isn't ready . # ID: And stressful . # ME: I think we it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together . # ME: Now we worked through each other , # PM: And you could ask things . # UI: you had information I didn't have # ME: something he said # ME: and you had information I also had , # ME: so some things I had in my presentation , they already told , # PM: And for me it sometimes was a surprise who was going to present what , huh ? # ME: I don't think that is the best way to work at for such project . # PM: So you would say communicate during our individual work . # ME: or maybe session of five minutes together or something , and then work separate . # ID: but why not work here together , for example ? # ID: Why should we be separated from each other in those difference different rooms ? # PM: probably to simulate the whole working process , # UI: I think so too . # UI: but then you can work together too # PM: you can't have a meeting for several weeks . # ME: like she told . Then you can work together too by mail or by , I dunno , chat , something , # UI: A chat would also be # ME: but now we're completely separated from each other . # ME: I don't think that was the best way , # ID: But the technology was fantastic . # ME: , the technology's okay . # UI: I don't really like the board , it doesn't really work great . Sometimes I think . # ME: but I don I do I think becau that's because # ID: Perhaps it is e # UI: It does work , but sometimes it doesn't erase or it doesn't # ID: perhaps it is easier to get one of those dig digital pens or so and to and lay it next to that keyboard over there . # ID: So you can draw see it over th on the screen . # ME: like the f like a plotters or something , Yep yep . # PM: you don't think the SMARTboard is really useful # ID: It's useful , but not m # ME: , it is useful , but # UI: but it doesn't really work all the time . # UI: Th the pen doesn't # ID: Because when you put this pen on the screen uh for exam and line is d being drawn at two or three centimetres below . # UI: The line is a bit off . # PM: so it's maybe a bit unnatural also . # UI: you can point to where you want the line to be . # ID: The project because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to have , you didn't have time to make a very qualitati qualitative presentation . # ID: So you used this the different PowerPoint presentations in which you put your material in the # PM: That wasn't me . # PM: the means , we discussed the smart board , and what about this digital pen ? # ME: I didn't use it at all . # UI: it was you can use it , it's quite handy I think . # PM: I use it as a normal pen and only you use it to get it on the computer , # UI: I used it to y to it did work pretty well . # ID: I used it too , oh well . # UI: I don't think why you would want to use it actually , # UI: but it does work . # ID: because it shou To make some designs , # ID: it is very easy . # ME: it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer . # UI: and then you can show it to everybody . # ID: But to write it th . # UI: It doesn't really write normally . # ME: It's b bi little bit too big to write . # ID: , it's too big , it's too fat . # ME: Fat document , those . # PM: and what about the teamwork ? # UI: I think it was great , # ME: Team work was okay . # PM: , well I think so too . # ME: Only thing that we worked through , past each other . # PM: but that was it was our assignment , # ME: With some things that was only problem , # UI: but it was because we didn't # ME: but furthermore better . # PM: and maybe I should walk out of the room when you discuss this point , the leadership . # UI: I thought it was good , # ID: Not too much , not too . # PM: And creativity ? # PM: when we look at this I'd say we have been creative , # ID: or the room for # PM: There was room for # ID: it was the idea to be creative , You got some standard ideas in your head and this what came out . # UI: And you get stuff from the from the computer , # ID: The information was sometimes a little bit too late # ME: Little bit lo . Too late it took a lot of time before you got your ema # UI: You just sit there for ten minutes . # UI: where is that email ? # ME: I played I think seven times Solitaire something . # PM: I didn't have time for that . # UI: Is it on there ? # UI: Is it on there ? # UI: I didn't find the didn't look but # PM: At some times I Sometimes I received like five emails at one moment , # ID: Was searching and searching . # ME: No , I never got that . # UI: I got like one email after ten minutes or something . # PM: I even got spam . Or something like that . # UI: That's what we said . # ME: So does this I think lik oh and information was a bit low I think , sometimes , # UI: And it not a lot # ME: in the beginning I didn't understand what to do . # UI: No , the first one . # ID: w I didn't know # ME: like I with the remote and I never new we have t we had to made a made a rec a remote control . # UI: And I didn't know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here , so I went , right . # ID: No stepping on the table and then looking at the internet page . # PM: And I was working and working and work # UI: Just looking at the screen # PM: Okay , well but after all we can say we are satisfied , but it could've been better . # PM: When we get when we have we would have gotten more information . # ID: more information about the costs . # UI: , that will be handy . # ID: First of all I didn't think that we were able to make an L_C_D_ screen first point , but it was possible # ME: it only costs four units . # UI: actually you could make an L_C_D_ screen but no mic , or it could make mic but no L_C_D_ screen , when you look at that . # PM: that was a bit mean to put it in the end . # PM: And what were the other points to improve this whole process ? # UI: Think that's about it . # ME: I think we got it already . # UI: Heavier less heavy laptops . # PM: they're pretty heavy . # ID: Faster laptop . # ID: They were they were just fine . # UI: But that's not really # ME: And furthermore the network was okay . # ME: Everything you loaded was also # UI: everything worked . # ME: av available there . # PM: And so more time w might have improved the quality of work , is what you say . # ME: . , but that It's now half past four half past three , # UI: but it's just the off hours between that you will work alone . # UI: Then it pops up pop up screen came . # UI: Five minutes in the meeting . # PM: Okay , so more time during the individual work phases . # PM: okay well I just got my warning for the last five minutes , so I'll move on to I guess my last slide , # PM: which is the closing . # PM: we managed , but we did it very quickly . # PM: I don't know if that's the best way to when it isn't is it when it is too expensive to quickly re-arrange it and say , okay , this is it , # PM: but we had to do it , because we have to have a design , and that is within the budget . # PM: And we evaluated . # PM: Maybe we should re-evaluate the product , but we did that before , and we also evaluated the project . # PM: And I think everybody's very happy . At least I am , with the results , celebration , well , for the three of you , because I have to write the final report now . # PM: But well , thank you very much for your co-operation , and I had a very nice day so far . # UI: Do we get another email ? # ID: Bling . You're fired . # ME: I think you do . # UI: I think we have to fill in a questionnaire again , # PM: I have t I think we also have to go to our own rooms again , but well I at least . # PM: But maybe you can try to make a screen shot of this , so I can try to include it in the final report . # ID: you can save it . # PM: wants to , but at least this one . # UI: but it's it isn't a picture or , well , is it ? # PM: I know , we should remove this , # ID: file save as the J_ PEG J_ PEG . # PM: but it won't h And please put it in the project folder then , huh . # ME: Can you find it as a J_ PEG ? # UI: isn't possible . # UI: But you can make a screen shot , I think . # PM: Okay , well I hereby officially close the meeting and I hope to see you soon . # ID: In about five minutes . # PM: I think we'll be a bit a bit longer , okay . Well , happy celebration , huh ? # ID: Let's let's have party . # UI: How big do you want the images ? # ME: Or shouldn't I ? # ID: Let's have some fun . # PM: Whatever you think is good . # ME: Six hundred . No , # ID: that is one thousand twenty four . # ME: I think eight hundred six hundred is better . # UI: it isn't on the desktop . # UI: You can only save it in my documents . # UI: Can we stay here ? # UI: Why can't we stay here ? # ME: Celebration time , come on . # ME: Peace out nigger .
# PM: And then you have to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot . # PM: It's important to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot over here . # UI: No , that's okay . # UI: Joost , your mouse . # UI: No mouse needed ? # ME: I've got a touch-pad . # ME: Do you know how I can wake it up ? # ME: You with your brilliant ideas . # ME: I don't know if I can touch the power button . # ME: Do you know how I can wake it up ? # PM: No . Try the power button . # ME: Come on , move it . # ME: Now , wake up , bitch . # ID: I've lost my screen . # ME: That wasn that wasn't very smart , I guess . # ME: Come on . Get back to me . # UI: You've got your name . # PM: , my name is name . # ME: No , I didn't restart it , I just closed it . # UI: Hope it working . # UI: Never close your laptop . # PM: Everybody's ready ? # ME: Great . Thanks . # PM: Well , welcome to the kick-off meeting . # PM: I forgot to put my name over here , it's Martin . # PM: , so you all know . # PM: Well , this is the agenda for today . # PM: Well , the opening is what I'm doing right now . # PM: , we gonna do some acquaintance things . # PM: give some examples of the tool training , project plan discussion and the closing . # PM: We have twenty five minutes . # PM: Okay , the project aim is to design a new remote control . # PM: , some of the oje objectives are that is has to be original , trendy , and user-friendly . # PM: So now we all know what our goal is . # PM: , I oh forget I forget the whole acquaintance part , but we all know each other . # PM: We all know each other's names . # PM: Joost , Guido , Antek . # UI: What is your name ? # UI: Antek Ahmet . And Joost . # PM: Okay . I think we al already been through that part . # PM: Okay , it consists of three levels of design . # PM: we begin with the functional design , then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design . # PM: Every level of design consists of some individual work , and we close it with a meeting . # PM: You all received an email with a example of our explanation of what the particular level of design means to the different functions , and you p you probably read that already , so I don't have to tell you about that . # PM: Okay , first we're gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these uh meeting tools . # PM: We have the smart-boards , the thes those two boards . # PM: This is the presentation boards , wh which one I'm using right now . # PM: You can there's a document folder called the sh shared document folder . # PM: You can upload your documents to that folder and then you can open them over here , so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen . # PM: We also have the white-board . # PM: , we're gonna skip through th # UI: Can we see the white-board on our laptops ? # PM: No , no . Just on the on the screen over there . # UI: No , I saw I saw the file , the smart-board that X_B_K_ but # PM: Oh , no . Probably is , but I don't know if the software is on the laptop . # PM: Is is if it's mainly a thing for in the meeting , so I don't think it's I don't know if it's important . # PM: This an explanation of the smart-boards . # PM: There is a tool-bar over here . # PM: It's quite simple . # PM: You have the pen function , eraser function . # PM: It's like a very simple paint application . # PM: , we well , we use the same file during the whole day , and you can make new sheets by pu puttin pressing on the blank button . # PM: It works like this . # PM: If pen is selected , yes . # UI: With that pen ? # PM: It's not But it is pen . # PM: It's not working like a pen yet . # PM: It's doing some stuff now . # PM: So you can use a pen . # UI: Little bit slower . # PM: You can use an eraser . # PM: And you can make new fi new blanks , and you can change the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward , which y you have to select pen format . And then select current colour or line width . # PM: So , it's quite easy . # PM: well , now you're all acquainted with the different tools . # PM: Right , we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards . # PM: , every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics , on blank sheets with different colours , with different pen widths . # PM: , I'll start off then . # PM: I'll use this same sheet . # PM: Oh , let me think . # PM: Different colours . # PM: Well , I'm gonna draw a p piranha . , a fish . # UI: piranha . Okay . # PM: I'm gonna use some different colour now . # PM: Some a little white . # PM: Looks like a fish . # PM: This is black ? # PM: Oh , this is just useless drawings but Oh teeth . I need teeth . # PM: Well , they're not supposed to be green , or whatever colour this is . # PM: What was I have su to sum up its favourite characteris # PM: Well , I like its sharp razor sharp teeth . # PM: Plus , the big forehead and a small , well a small actual face . # PM: And I like its overall aggressive look and Well , that's what I like about piranha . # PM: I think that's kind of what the intention should be . # PM: Well , who wants to be next ? # ME: Nobody , I guess . # UI: I will try . I will try . # PM: You go , Guido ? Okay . # PM: , make a new sheet . # PM: , it's by pressing on blank . # UI: Then pen again ? # PM: And so in the format menu you can choose the different colours and pen widths . # UI: , I don't know what my favourite animal is , but the easiest animal I can think is a bird . # ME: You know , I thought of that actually . # UI: That's my bird . # UI: Isn't it quite it's a little bit light . # UI: , another colour maybe . A red one . # UI: Oh that's okay . # UI: That's another one . # PM: Well , tell us something about your favourite characteristics of these particular birds . # ME: Its simplicity . # UI: , it's the most simple animal I know , I think . # UI: Maybe because there's some s free maybe in the sky or something like that . # UI: Maybe a little bit . # UI: So more birds ? # PM: We get your point . # PM: Okay . Who wants to be next ? # UI: Okay , okay , okay . # ME: , whatever . I'll go next . # ME: I haven't got a favourite animal too , so # ME: Oh . What should I draw ? # ME: Thank you , I'll draw a penguin . # ME: I'll draw a penguin . # ME: I can't draw , so you can start to laugh already . # ME: Something like that . # UI: , it's little bit hard . # ME: Mm hmm , orange . # UI: Orange , of course . # ME: Oh , it's better than your bird . # ME: Everything's better than your bird . # ME: , I like its ugliness and , whatever . # ME: The way it walks or whatever . # ID: I'm going to draw a cat . # ID: I don't know why , but a cat is a very smart animal . # ID: And you can have them at home . # ID: Which is not as the case with bingwings and # PM: Well , you can have a piranha at home . # UI: Don't mess with my birds , . # ID: It's not very good drawn , but you can see a cat from it . # ME: It's a handicapped cat . # PM: I don't think I don't think Darwin would agree with that . # ID: , it's not scared . He's crying but # ME: He's crying because it's ugl because of his ugliness . # PM: What do you like about it then ? # ID: it's i most cats are small . # ID: You can handle them . # PM: Okay . Okay . Okay , and then we are through the tool training , I guess . # ME: I wouldn't call it training , but # PM: Okay , this is something about the project finance . # PM: The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros . # PM: And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros . # PM: We're very ambitious on this one . # PM: The market range is international , so it's gonna be sold world-wide , and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control . # PM: So that's clear . # PM: Okay , we're now gonna discuss some stuff when well , we're gonna brainstorm about what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be . # PM: , well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls . # PM: Do you have know what good experiences with remote controls ? # PM: Or do they annoy you sometimes ? # PM: Are they difficult to understand , or maybe they don't interact with different kind of equipment very well ? # ME: I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls , but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever . # ME: And then a totally different remote control with different functions on different places , and half of the functions a are removed , or whatever . # ME: , so I think what we need is a clear remote control with grouped buttons , you know . # ME: All th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in one # PM: Different functions of # ME: Well , one area or whatever , not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to , to minimise it to this or whatever o other functions totally somewhere else . # ME: I think we should group them . # ME: And same for the for the volume buttons and the t # PM: And , is it gonna be a remote control that's what it can be used for different kind of equipment , like your T_V_ and your home stereo ? # ME: Well I was I was thinking since a T_V_ is mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players , recorders . # PM: But , the D_V_D_ players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi-fi sets probably . # PM: It's what , from my experience . # ME: Hi-fi set is not often used as I know of in combination with television . # UI: It's only for television , I thought . Not # PM: Oh , it is only for televis # UI: I thought it was only for television . # UI: So so we probably don't have to have to have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_ . # ME: Yes , it is only for television , but # PM: So wha what What wha what document # ME: well we we're gonna brainstorm about that . # ME: If we think it's useful , we do it . # PM: But , where did it Where did you find that ? # UI: I thought it said # ME: That's right . It's a television remote control . # UI: , television remote control . # ME: But I was thinking since it is useful with D_V_D_ # PM: , but most television remote controls support other functions as well . # ID: Yes , that's something extras . # PM: No , we have to think about that . # PM: Okay , but we've gonna put some a is it so user-friendliness , is a is a pri priority in this case , or # ME: , also no one's gonna buy it . # ID: Only the experts . # PM: Well , this the maybe is some aspect of the , or some point at which we can excel by making it very useful . # PM: That w Well , then you're the usability man , so this gonna be a very important task for you then . # PM: Well , other ideas ? # PM: How can we make it trendy or something ? # PM: Do by just sh shape and the look of it ? # ID: , to go with to go with fashion and # PM: Maybe a can opener underneath it ? # PM: Or someth something special , like M_P_ three player inside of it , or # UI: I , no I think it # PM: Oh , well then the production costs are gonna be too high probably . # UI: , I th I think yo we have to keep it simple , to get a whole market . # PM: Okay . Maybe with different type of fronts or # UI: It's international , so we have to use a standard . # PM: Well , m has to be something spectacular or one which makes it # ME: Well that's an idea of course , . # PM: We gonna skip back to the goals probably . , original , trendly , and user-friendly Well , we al also already talked about user-friendliness . # PM: No , well something trendy and original , well that goes hand in hand I guess . # PM: When something is original , it tends to be trendy , probably , or we should make it combination of that . # PM: 'Kay , so you the technical part of the process is something you're gonna look after for , so you have to think about what kind of equipment you want to , you know , you want to manage with it . # PM: Well , and that's an important part for you then , with gogors regards to the user-friendly part of it . # UI: Use friendly . # PM: Well , and you should look out for what makes it trendy . # PM: Well , you know , y like some special feature . # PM: Or some Does it does it gets some gadgetness or something . # ME: Yes , what the market wishes . # PM: Well , the closing . # PM: Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . # PM: Individual , I think so . # PM: The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design , of course , we will Already s said that . # PM: The User Interface Designer is it a User Inter User Interface # PM: the technical functions design . # PM: And the Management Expert of the Marketing Expert . User requirements specifi Well , this one was already clear to us . # PM: Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . # PM: I don't know how much time we have left . # PM: Oh , not many I guess . # PM: We started at twelve . # ME: You just got a message . # PM: Oh , and what does it said ? # ME: And it said five minutes , so we got four and a half . # UI: I didn't get a message . # ME: He's the whatever . # UI: Oh , the Project Manager . # PM: No , we're ahead of schedule then . # ME: He is the whatever . # PM: I'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes . # PM: And it's clear you can put the stuff in the project documents presentations . # PM: You can all Or we're all # ME: Project joc project documents is for showing on the white-board . # PM: , but we're all familiar with uh Microsoft PowerPoint , are we ? # PM: I'm gonna wri write some stuff down # PM: and then we're ready . # PM: Or we can leave already I guess . # PM: or sh or should we or is important that we leave at exact # ME: I don't think so . # UI: I don't think Oh # PM: We'll see each other in thirty minutes . # UI: I will need it . # ME: I will need it .
# UI: Here we go again . # ID: My mouse is not working anymore . # ID: when I put it in , is going to beep . # ME: Oh , I got a nice little screen here over here . # ME: I got like this big black border on every side . # PM: Everybody ready ? # PM: Welcome at the functional design meeting , again presented by Maarten . # PM: this is the agenda , the opening . # PM: , we've got three presentations . # PM: And I'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me . # PM: And we're gonna make a decision on the remote control functions . # PM: We have forty minutes . # PM: Oh , well this is the closing already . # PM: So well we start off with the th the first presentation then . # PM: , I think in we have to do it in right order . # ME: I don't know what the right order is . So # PM: Well , it Oh that . It won't doesn't Maybe we should start with the technical functions . # ID: how can I get this on the whiteboard ? # PM: Well it's you dumped the file in the in the sh in the project document folder . # ID: I've done that . # PM: You've already done that ? # UI: No can that open . # PM: Well let's close this one . # PM: We'll just open a new one . # UI: Open it there . # PM: Uh-oh . New thing . # PM: Oh , I have to say something . # PM: , due to some technical problems I haven't digitized the last the meeting minutes . # PM: But I'll make sure that happens next time . # UI: About the get # PM: And I'll get this one in digital form too . # ID: 'Kay , we're going to talk about working design . # ID: , the method of the remote control is electrical energy , it activates a chip in the remote . # ID: It's an electrical circuit which compose messages in the form of uh infrared signals to control the television . # ID: Mm , it's a nowadays very known , a known uh technology . # ID: , the known technology can make a cost very low . # ID: , it's a wild a wide sale of remote controls in the world . # ID: And and the components are very cheap . # ID: , diodes , bat batteries and uh LED lights , they're needed and they're everywhere available . # ID: , again , it's a fair price . # ID: It's a common technology , like I told , the circuit board , it's the most important part of the remote control . # ID: , we can use for that fibreglass with copper wires , it's it is can be made as fast as printing paper . # ID: It's it's all very , they're making it all the time . , and it's not very specialised technology . # ID: I haven't come to here , but I've got some images of remote controls . # ID: They were not very trendy or just a remote control like everyone knows . # ID: So I don't know why I should put it here . # PM: Okay . But it's the technical side of the remote control . # ID: but I haven't made it because of the time . # PM: Okay . Well , we'll have to skip that part then . # PM: But you don't think it's a problem to design the technical part of the remote control ? # PM: It's gonna be easy ? # UI: But nothing restricted for user interface ? # UI: With technical # ID: , no , it's just a part of a known technology , . # ID: Remote control is nothing special nowadays . # PM: R regardless of what type of functions we want to implement . Doesn't really matter . # ID: I don't think so , # ID: because of the all the televisions there are a few maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions , but is it useful to put them on a on a standard remote ? # PM: Well , we'll see . We'll see later on . # UI: Well , the technical functions . # UI: , well I don't know if you got the same pictures as I got , but I got these two , and I think they're we have to focus on the one hand the expert view or the novice user . # UI: th I think it's very much depending on the user requirements , I don't s know who's doing t # PM: Well , will there be some user requirements later on ? # PM: The ones I I've received from the account manager . # UI: , but it I think that's very important to watch what kind of functions there we want to put in a remote control . # PM: Well , we'll keep this in mind , and then discuss it later on . # UI: well y we can put functions in it when , when we get the user requirements and we can update it . # PM: but this real this big d distinction between this type of remote . # PM: we should we should choose one we should not compromise but really choose for expert viewer or novice v # PM: Well , what that's what you want trying to say . # UI: w if you want try a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market , like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user . # UI: But I don't know . # UI: It's it's really depending on how far the remote controls are already in n in use . # PM: , well some of these Well , some of that will , but i but it will be more clear when we come to the u some of the new requirements . # UI: well , there are l at least basic functions , like just th the channels one till nine , on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that . # UI: , most standard have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel . # UI: I think that's just basic what we need . # UI: And from that on we can user requirements what we need more . # UI: , I just um I thought Joost was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets , and I don't know if there are any if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that . # UI: M you can just you can k # ME: I haven't really found a conclusion like that . # UI: you can keep it in mind that . # UI: , I th I thought the with less buttons you can make a more trendier # UI: , more trendier design , I think . I think . # ME: Sounds interesting . # UI: , well , that's all I have to say , I think . # PM: Well , then the Marketing expert can tell us something about the current market . # ME: Alright , I've done some research for functional requirements . # ME: The working method there were hundred uh w h one hundred people , how do you say , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also filled out a questionnaire with a few questions . # ME: , I've lined them up here . # ME: , ask whether common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and stuff like that . # ME: I have found some interesting things . # ME: We do we do got a market . # ME: three out of four people claim m to find remote controls ugly . # ME: So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach . # ME: , three out of four users zaps a lot , as I quoted here from the results . # ME: Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . # ME: That's quite a lot . # ME: relevant options are , of course , power buttons . Although , only used once per hour . # ME: , channel selection , volume and buttons for text , and the more , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and very much used . # ME: Furthermore , fifty percent says they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . # ME: That doesn't say we got we can leave ninety percent off . But it sure says we shouldn't make it too complicated . # ME: Fifty percent also claims to have lost a remote control very often in the room . # ME: And an important thing here , the most important customers , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . # ME: And elderly people , our market , are less interested in nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls . # ME: So , what I was thinking oh , wrong side . # ME: We shouldn't implement too much features on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost . # ME: Group features for a higher usability , what I was claiming in the previous meeting . # ME: , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used , we could group them on one button and make them accessible in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it there are a lot of options there , so we can really make , how do you say , we can spare at buttons over there . # ME: And , if you want to implement V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ options , group them in the button , not too Small buttons , so they won't be very , how do you say # PM: Visually presents . # ME: Yes , won't be very present , thank you . # ME: And a trendy look , well , although seventy percent of the market is consists of elderly people who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever , I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent . # ME: That was kind of what I found . # PM: Well , then we I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on what features we find important . # PM: , well some of the new requirements make some of your findings quite irrelevant , I think . # PM: Because s decided to put They have decide to put two additional requirements forward . # PM: Well , now I see four . # PM: That's kinda strange . # PM: Well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . # PM: Well , I think that may be so , but well , we can't just leave the teletext button off . # PM: It's impossible , I think . # ME: No , I agree , I agree . # PM: So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and don't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or # ME: Not too much , no . # PM: You know , it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much . # PM: So we have to think of that . # PM: The remote control should only be used for television . Otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t ma the time to market . # PM: So maybe we should leave all D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ related features off completely . # PM: I think that that's what they're trying to say . # PM: , our current customers are within the age group of forty plus . # PM: New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . # PM: So you talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested . # PM: But , well , they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger # ME: I don't really agree actually , to be honest . # ME: It's a very small market which we will approach then if we want to reach customers younger than forty . # ME: It's only like thirty percent of the total market . # PM: , but it is it's is a dif it's a fact that the th that bigger market you're talking about , we already cover that . # PM: Our company already sells remote control to the older people , but we also want , you know , a new customer group . # PM: That's the one we haven't covered yet . # PM: So I think that's what the problem is . # PM: We haven't got remote controls for Well I think , . # ME: Maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit . # ME: Not too much then , bu alright . # PM: no , but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants . # PM: So maybe we can make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either . # PM: , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products . # PM: Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . # PM: Okay , something else nice to know . # UI: But what's our slogan ? # PM: , you will have to look that up . # ME: , I'll have a look . # PM: I think it's something about the # UI: Puts fashion in electronics . # ME: We put the fashion in electronics . # PM: I thought it w might be , let's make things better or something , but # UI: Sense simplicity . # ME: Sense and simplicity . # PM: Okay well , let's go back to the agenda . # PM: So we've now had to the three presentations . # PM: We know about the new project requirements . # PM: That means we can well d , discuss on the remote control functions . # PM: Well , if I can make a start , I think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be , and I already talked about the maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the can opener underneath it . # PM: I think we're looking for some , we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions . # ME: Well , to be honest , if our aim group is till forty , not older than forty , maybe that's not very , we don't really need to have a simple remote control . # ME: I think we can implement more functions then , because basically the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology # ME: and therefore will be a more # PM: M , that's why well a lot of the use the requirements the account manager sent me , I think they are c are contradicting each other , because they want a simpler design , and no other s functions than just T_V_ , but they s do aim at a younger Well , ma # UI: , but you sai you said that a lot of functions aren't used . # UI: So why should j we put this function in ? # UI: I think more I think people younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than more functions . # PM: But I think you we can make some discuss distinctions in what kin in the , know , th in functions you have Well you have different kind of equipment in your room , like a t T_V_ and a D_V_D_ player . # PM: You can , know , you can make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the T_V_ set on your remote control with the with the , you know , audio settings and v screen settings . # PM: We don't want that . # PM: I think that was that became clear . # PM: But w maybe we should put some func , I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to , you know , they want to # PM: control , remotely . # UI: , d , but th the functions are not in the remote control we're making . # PM: No , th the user requirements of the The new project requirements told us not to But maybe w . I think we maybe should , well we should put some functions for other maybe for other equipment on it . # PM: But just the basic functions . Maybe like rewind and wind , or n what d what do you guys think ? # ID: But you can put them under the same button . # ME: Not much more than that . # PM: , if as far as possible . # ME: Or we can u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever . # PM: But what do you think ? # PM: Do th should we implement features that uh or functions that to control other devices ? # PM: No , you don't think so ? # UI: No , new requirements say no . # PM: , the new requirements say so . # ID: But you can put a play and stop and rewind . # PM: Well , maybe it's maybe there is something th m most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as well as their own remote control . # PM: You know , a lot of D_V_D_ players have some tricky settings with # UI: I i if it's too simple th they won't use the remote control , they use their own th with lot more functions . # PM: That's that's wha # ME: But but for example , V_C_R_ , that's better example in this case . # ME: I think on a remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme the V_C_R_ to start recording at three P_M_ or whatever , # PM: No no , you don't No no , you don't need it . No , no . # UI: No , no . Exactly . # ME: just play , stop , rewind and fast forward . # PM: Okay , but we have to think w we have to think D_V_D_ I th , I guess , so but from my experience it's kinda a lot of D_V_D_ players , you know , like forwarding , goes differently . # PM: , you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed . # PM: It's c sometimes a bit difficult . # PM: Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m Well , I was thinking about putting it in , but concerning the project requirements and what you just said , I think we m should focus on the T_V_ then . # UI: but just keep it simple and look more at th # PM: And and it's just an a complimentary remote and not a universal one . # PM: If you want to keep it simple , you can make a universal remote . # UI: It's only for television . So # PM: It's just a s it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table , # ID: Yes , but there are there are # PM: and it's just for when you jump on the couch , you pick up the nice remote , the simple one , just to put on the television , nothing more . # UI: , nothing more . Exactly . # PM: , but what televis # ID: But how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ? # ID: There are a dozen of dozens of remote controls that have # PM: , we we'll make w this one trendy . # UI: The user interface is easy . # PM: Well , we will come to that , but ju first on the on the functions . # PM: So we should put zap buttons on it . # PM: , also numbers , to go to the specific channels . # UI: And the basic , basic functions , . # ME: Yes , definitely , . # UI: It's too much integrated in the other . # PM: a t a teletext button should be there . # PM: But just one big teletext button , on and off . # ME: and maybe two or three other options , but not nothing more than that . # ME: I think stop function is very useful . # ME: If you have a page which consists of more pages , and you are not a very quick reader , # ME: then I think it's very irritating if the next page shows up , but # PM: , but I think that becomes too difficult , it's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then . # ME: Well , I use it very regularly , the action . I re I use it quite often . # PM: , but maybe you s yeah , maybe y you do , but I've never heard of it in the first place . And # UI: Will you look # PM: we have to well t , and t and teletext is becoming outdated . # UI: Look at the market . # PM: We just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably . # PM: I think that that's kin getting too complex for our remote . # PM: I don't know what you th guys think . # ME: Might be . Might be . # UI: Sunday I always use it for the , for the soccer # PM: , but do you like to have a such a s stop button ? # PM: Or do you think it I think it's a kind of uh very rare and special function . # UI: Well , when you uh when you look for example , a couple of weeks ago I looked at the for the flights , and there are a lot of flights in one page , so if th # PM: Okay , it goes , but that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now . # PM: That's why it was said in the in the use in the r new requirements . # ID: Yes , but you could put on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to access all the same pages . # ID: If you have seven pages , you can go up and down . # PM: lots of new televisions can store pages , you know , and then you can just skip manually through them using I think we should just put one teletext button on it . # PM: Then we meet the new requirements . # PM: we also meet the other thin y you sh you just re we have to choose for the simple design , I guess . # PM: well , what functions do we have to decide on ? # PM: Or do we I dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want . # PM: We have the zap and the volume . # PM: Should we do m make them very big ? The the zap button . # ME: I think the plus and the minus button should be quite present , # PM: Th that's considered to be trendy also . # PM: Or maybe you should place them on a , in a special way ? # ID: Maybe we can make a kind of a joystick . # PM: , something or somethin special way to zap through the it has to s it has to be , and quick . You have to use it very quickly . # ME: If you grab the remote , your hands should be on top of the plus . # PM: and it the buttons should make it possible to zap through your channels in a rapid at a rapid pace . # PM: Oh , what should we decide on then ? # PM: I think in a in a case of this simple remote control , the technical aspects which weren't worked out already , but it w shouldn't be a problem then . # ID: No , it's o just signals and the television d does the rest . # PM: No , okay , but we don't have to , when we don't want to control other devices , I think it makes it even more simple . # UI: maybe we uh the batteries maybe . If you use large batteries or small batter batteries . # ID: The most standard batteries . # PM: I think that we should use d # ME: I think double A_ . # PM: , not the b the watch kind th the most Well , it has to be simple , and I wi # ME: The most ordinary batteries . # PM: Which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house , you know . # PM: Oh . How much time do we ha we have left ? # PM: M m more than thirty minutes ? # ME: I think about twenty minutes . # PM: ten twenty minutes . # PM: Well , these shouldn't # ID: But i in a way we have to be uh special . # PM: But that's Do you have you have you think about tha thought about that ? How we can what the extra touch can be . # PM: Do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f kind of feature or # PM: Well , it was something about how we lose them . # PM: Maybe it should be a remote control when you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing . # ME: I think that's n that's more for a for an age range or ten to twelve or whatever . # UI: To find him . That's maybe . # PM: I don't know . I don't know . # PM: Nah , a lot of people like to have such kind of kind of gay kind of things . # PM: It w it w should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone , and it is i has something nice . # ME: , that's good one , yep . # PM: Or maybe it w should have a big light that can flash or something on it , or maybe it should or an or the like the can opener . Maybe it contains some feature that you don't normally link to a remote control . # PM: I think it's very impor because we're gonna make such a basic remote control , we have to do something to make it special . # PM: It's gonna cost twenty five Euros . # ME: Ye I think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually , because television and beer is not a rare combination . # PM: , but the well , it's already been done . # PM: Nah . , that's true . # PM: and I think it's gonna be very it has to be sturdy or something , so maybe with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something . # PM: it has to be used something special , and you really it has to , you know y not s people , when they buy it , they have to think , well this one lasts for a long time . We're really gonna use them . # PM: Not some thing you throw away next week , you know . # ME: No , that's true . # PM: So maybe that's i I think that's when we decide on these type of functions , know , basic functions , it's very important to find something like this . # PM: So there's a very important task for you . # PM: And maybe we can all think about it . # PM: , also for you maybe , when t you it's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy , and al as in a friend use friendly as well , you know . # UI: And use friendly , . # PM: So big buttons , flashy design , and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing . # UI: Must brain-storm . # ME: a swapable front or whatever . # PM: , or just different colours would be I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their remote control . # ID: For the remote control . # PM: It could be , you never know , but # UI: More money for us . # PM: and I think we have to make it quite big . # UI: Quite big . , you think ? # ME: Yes , definitely , definitely . # ID: That's to be a formed for your hand . # PM: So , and also because it is expensive . # PM: If you want it to be something , you know , it's ha doesn't have much functions want to be you don't want to get it l make it # ME: Yes , it should be f be visible nearly anywhere in the room . # ME: As I as I said during my presentation , fifty percent o # PM: And shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table . # PM: I think you m might wanna put it # UI: A standard or something . # PM: , that it stands up . # PM: , you have to put it on its So it's like a vase or something you put on a table . # PM: no , put stuff inside it . But , it's like a statue or something # ID: More like a joystick then . # ME: , I see what you mean , yep . # UI: It's like you have four phones . Something like that . # PM: , but , but you also can put it somewhere near the window in # ME: If you do that , but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros . # PM: That it's fashionable . # ME: I in the base we could like make a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise . # ME: That's probably stupid , but as I found here , fifty percent , was it fifty ? # ID: But that's fun for the first time , and then the second # ME: fifty percent fifty percent often loses remote control . # PM: , but when you when it gets lost , how can you press the button to make it # ME: No , of the base the thing you put it in . # UI: On the television . # PM: , that's kind of nice . # ME: If an a button in that # PM: And then also you don't even need batteries , because you can make it chargeable . # UI: A char chargeable . # ME: , you can ma make rechargeable one , . Why not . # PM: , that w , but , the pro No , well I think that it might be t p Well , nee but we don't . # PM: Maybe you , but we don't know much about production cost , but when you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control , then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know , rechargeable units . # ID: With recharger . # ME: It should only cost twelve and a half Euros , of course . Aye ? # PM: , but we would d ma we'd do it in Taiwan and So , it's not gonna be that expen # PM: I think it's a great idea . # UI: It should be possible . # UI: I think it's a good idea . # PM: S some kind of be I've never seen that before , and you make it be , you see it with the mo the mouses nowadays . # UI: To make a base or something ? # ME: Yes . Yes , definitely . # ID: Yes , but is that handy ? # PM: Well , I well it's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem . That's one . # PM: And you can always find your remote control up # UI: not the purpose to be handy , it's # ID: But but remote controls remote controls nowadays can last two years , three years , with t two batteries . # PM: Well , maybe , you could when that's when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger , # PM: but you will you do need also an , also you would need a battery in the base unit as well , you know . # PM: Does it makes it kinda # ME: Well y you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , of course . # UI: Mm . , but that's not it's ugly , I think . # PM: , but then it's very easy to make it also a rechargeab I don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it . # ME: On the other hand , if you don't do it , we can also make a nice bay . # ME: I mean , it looks trendy and still put a bleep function in it , but I think the bay is definitely # PM: I think it's a good idea . # PM: And make it , you know , we Well , we it's it isn't a t a most costly remote control . # PM: We can save on the on the functions . # PM: We just put some simple button in , make it big and sturdy , nothing more , and just make s sure there's some noise that it can make , or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it that it lights up , # ME: Sure , why not . Yep . # PM: it's also nice . # PM: And if you put it away , I think it's w we have to we that's it's not a easy market . # PM: We have to something special . # PM: And for twenty five Euros people want something remote c special from your mote control , and we can't deliver that in r with regards to the functions , # PM: because we aren't gonna put # ME: With eye candy , ear candy , whatever . , definitely . # PM: And then when make it , you know , nice looking shape and this and then you also you got the stand-up thing . # PM: I think I think it's a good idea . # UI: , it must be must be a gadget to have . # PM: Oh , if it let's well , we will see what's possible concerning the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that . # PM: And we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing . # PM: And the first thing we the most likeable thing to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something . # PM: If that's too expensive , we won't do that . # PM: But it would be nice . # ME: It would be nice , yes . # PM: I know that batteries last long nowadays . # PM: And and what people just think about , well , I'll never have to buy any r batteries again , so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty . # PM: And you know then when you haven't batteries around , and probably for two weeks , your remo I've experienced that # ME: Most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty , so yes . # PM: So , easy functions . Well , we will we will I think we'll work that out , zapping , numbers on it , bi # UI: Or just give a beep when the battery's out or down . # PM: But it's also annoying . # PM: 'cause as long as it stays as it ke keeps working , you're not very motivated to do something about it . # PM: Then it beeps all the time and . # ME: No , that's true . # PM: You don't want to have ever have those problems , and you won't have if you have the rechargeable . # PM: And you don't have to use the unit , you can also put it on the side if people don't like it . # PM: , i in the in the ma # ID: But you pay for it . # PM: , but it w I mean , if they pay for it because they think , oh , that's a great idea , I'm gonna use it . # PM: And when it , you know , when time goes by and they think , well , I'll never put him in the recharger , I think last long enough , then they put it on side and they can use it now and then . # PM: Then when they look get m I know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control , within a couple of months of they will be in the situation that they they're seeking for the remote control , they wanna see something quick and just push the button and th , I think it's brilliant . # ME: Bleep bleep , oh there it is , . # PM: , I've never it's so simple , but I've never seen it . # PM: M maybe we should really do this . # UI: And you can leave it just there . # PM: Okay now , well , how much time have we got left ? # PM: These clocks aren't synched . # PM: Oh , now I've put well , it is twenty p Okay , so we have ten minutes or something ? # ME: Something like that , . # PM: , but we're done . I think . # UI: fifteen minutes . # PM: We've decided on the functions . # PM: Well , there is some oh . # PM: There is a closing sheet . # PM: We have lunch break , and then we have thirty minutes of individual work . # PM: Oh okay , I'll make sure I'll I had some problems with the digitising the first minutes , the s the next minutes won't be a problem , but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too , but maybe it won't work , but you'll see . # PM: I think these are more important than the first ones , so # UI: Can you make an uh a part of f folder for the minutes maybe ? # UI: That not everything in one folder . # ME: Maarten , five minutes . # PM: Oh , five minutes . # PM: , because I d I did the first minutes I did were a bit scratchy , you know . # PM: Then I did a s second one with a nicer layout , which I could , know , use for the other ones well , but I d think I forgot to do put done under the first one , and when you go write a second it's get it's not working when you try to write second paper or something . # ME: No , that's true , . # PM: And then you had to overwrite it or someth I don't know . # PM: Becau I d , it was not my pen . # ME: Should we by the way draw # PM: this kind of looks you like . # ME: on our nice whiteboard , a little idea of # PM: , probably , it would be nice . # ME: Has anyone got a little bit detailed ideas about the shape ? # UI: Do you get an idea of the shape ? # ME: I don't , for one . # ID: Maybe like this pen . # ME: A bit bigger I guess , but # UI: A little bit bigger , but # ME: The shape is nice , it's something different , and we want we want that . # ID: It has to feel nice in your hand . # PM: Well , I have to say , I have this can opening remote control in my head most of all , or I think some maybe we should no , that will be too costly . # UI: Oh , look at the pictures . # PM: We shou we could also , that was a would also be an idea , but I don't think it I don't know if it exists already , you should like make Alessi or something design it . # PM: That would also be nice . # PM: But that's gonna then you c then you don't # ME: , but twelve and a half Euros ? # PM: , but then you don't have t it that's not something i that's in the production cost a one it's a one time , you know s was it's a single cost . # PM: , m but then you can nah , I don't thin I think that it would be more expensive , because I've bought the Alessi stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive . # PM: Would be a nice idea though . # PM: I think it has to be a r it has to have round forms or something . # PM: Like something like that or so or so # ME: Something like that is very ergonomic . # PM: And on th and then s a base unit underneath it . It's also round . # PM: Put it in there wire on it . # PM: Maybe , I don't know , some lights , a big but well . # UI: , flash lights at the side . At the side , or something like that . # PM: Volume and programme , . # ME: Yes , volume and programme should be there I guess , because you hands wi y your hands will be in the smaller part . # PM: And some of the extra funct Some of the extra functions over here . Numbers . # ME: and the numbers on top , I guess . # PM: And and lights ? # PM: How we're g well , maybe s a ring of no , no , you have to Maybe on the side of it . # ME: Maybe ro roun rounds # PM: Along the side strip of . # UI: Just two LEDs or something on the side . # ME: Maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons . # PM: but I also meant the blinking li w you know , the ones that also blink when you try to uh locate your remote . # PM: Well , theys have to be # UI: Well , probably at the side . # UI: You know look at the front , but # PM: When you see it from the side , then it would look just like that . # PM: And then you have a strip of lights or something # UI: , exactly , and then there is . # UI: , something like that , . # PM: Well , I think it's nice , for one thing . # PM: maybe put something on top of it or , you know , like that's looks funny . # ME: I think I think that'll be too big tha too big then . # UI: Bumper or something . # PM: We'll have to think about it . # PM: I think we're done . # PM: We can save this one . # ME: Yes , I guess it's lunch time . # ME: Half and hour ? # ME: I thought our next individual round was half an hour . # PM: , that was what # ME: I don't know about the lunch break . # PM: Mm , we'll hear about it .
# PM: Welcome to the conceptual design meeting . # PM: I'll again be the secretary and make minutes , take minutes , and it will be three presentations , just like the last meeting . # PM: So , who wants to start off ? # PM: Technical designer again ? # PM: , . , before we begin it , I want to say I've put the minutes of the second meeting in the shared folder , but they're still not quite okay . # PM: It it still some technical difficulties so the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that were layered over each other . # PM: But , from now on I won't use my pen anymore , so will be p just ordinary keyboard . # UI: , may be better , . # ME: Keyboard work . # PM: I think it will be more easy for you to read the minutes . # ID: Okay , when we talk about components design , it's really about the material and the and uh really the stuff we build the remote controls of . # ID: , a remote control consist of components and the components of a remote control consist of properties and material . # ID: We have to choose th these wisely and it could affect uh a kind of grow of in buying the remote controls . # ID: , the components of a remote control are of course the case . # ID: the properties of the case , it has to be solid in hard material like hard plastic with soft rubber for falling and uh , it feels good in your hand . # ID: Mm the buttons has to be solid too , and the material is soft rubber . # ID: I've got a email from the possibilities of Real Reaction . # ID: they're telling me that when we build a remote control of plastic or rubber , the buttons have to be rubber too . # ID: I when we use a rubbled a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to the rubber double-curved case is a is a t three-dimensional curve in the in the design , which is necessary when we want to be trendy . # ID: the energy source , I've got a lot of possibilities for that too . # ID: the basic battery , which I thi prefer because of its non non-depending of here you have to have a hand , kinetic energy . # ID: Also in this one , like in the watches , but a remote control can lie on a table for a day , and then you push a button and so you don't have to walk with it all the all the time . # ID: Mm , solar cells are also a bit weird for remote controls . # ID: also the case material , I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because wood or titanium would also be a bit weird . # UI: Oh titanium is probably trendy , I think . # ME: That's true , I guess . # UI: Well , maybe a little bit expensive . # ID: , they don't tell anything about the cost of titanium . # ID: the chip the chip set and the board is all off the shelf . # ID: Also , the speaker in the remote control , when we want to retrieve it . # ID: , the base station is also off the shelf , all the materials and the components are just available in our factory . # ID: I've told about the three first points . # ID: Mm , the simple electronical chip is available with the LED transmitter . # ID: , it's all off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all available in our company . # ID: , another possibility . I , I looked up on was the L_C_D_ displays . # ID: Could be something special to our remote control , and it's possible , but it only cost a bit more , but maybe it can be within the limits of twenty five Euros . # PM: Twelve and a half . # UI: , production cost . # ID: I th I got an email with some examples and it these were the most trendiest one . # ID: You see a covers , which can be # PM: What are those , t tooth brushes , or so # PM: But it's actually kind of well , it resembles the design I had in mind for this proj You know the cartoonish Alessi kind of design . # ID: Yes , maybe we can bri bring a couple of couple of types of # PM: And we can we can steal their ideas . # ID: maybe a kind of whole a whole set of different remote controls . # ID: Maybe we can bring a whole line with a huge variety of # PM: Well , it's a possibility , too . # UI: Different colours also . # ID: Like maybe radios and television also in this in this in the same style , but # ME: , that'll be for the future , I guess . # PM: Next time we're here . # ID: because we have to we have to we have to bring the logo and all the stuff back into it . # UI: Well , I shall go to the next slide . # UI: , I still don't have any information about user requirements . # UI: I was thinking about just the basic functions and I got # PM: Oh , we decided upon that in the last meeting . # UI: , but then wh I don't know when there are new user requirements . # PM: Well , tha I didn't receive any new requirements or somethi # UI: I ha I ha I have the I have nothing . # PM: no , but we decided to use only b basic functions only . # UI: Well , I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of . # UI: I dunno if they're maybe a little bit more , but # PM: Well we maybe we can think of that later . # PM: these are the ones you already summed up in the # UI: , I well , I pointed them out here , just to make it a little bit easier . # UI: Another function is of course we already discuss it on the side . # UI: , I don't know what costs of it . # UI: , I've no idea about it . # UI: , I was also looking for what you said , for I got an email uh about L_C_D_ in front of the remote control . # UI: I don't know if that's a good idea , or maybe it's a little bit too much for twelve and a half . Production . # UI: If we got already something like a base . # PM: That might get redundant also maybe . # PM: I don't know what kind of information it would # UI: I d I ju I was just thinking about it . Then I got a pop-ups to go to the meeting . But # ID: Maybe we can bring t uh teletext to the t to the remote control . # UI: The remote control . # UI: a little too A little bit # ME: and then you've got a flag s Very big R_C_ . # PM: Okay . That's not It was not a good idea . # UI: A little bit too big , I think . # UI: , . Well , the functions are not more to discuss , I think . # UI: It's it's just the base things we already discussed that the no V_C_R_ or that kind of , so that's very easy . # PM: But you do mention the next and previous button . # UI: Well , that's next channel . I mean next channel . # ME: Next channel , previous channel . # PM: Oh , okay , o okay . # UI: oh , I got an email with an a remote control with a base . # UI: So , it's just an idea . # UI: And I thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure if they have to be big or just small # ID: But you're the expert . # ME: I think it depends on the function . # UI: Well , I'm not a e I'm the expert for user-friendly , but not for trendiness . # ME: Well , if you save Perhaps s tiny buttons aren't user-friendly , then we wouldn't im implement that of course . # UI: okay , that's your point . # UI: , I've nothing to s # PM: Well , w when we only use basic functions , we have the possibility to make the buttons larger . # ME: Oh , that's right . # UI: , with a little bit larger , . # UI: I thought so , but maybe with the # PM: Well , I think we already agreed upon the fact that the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons , th those two have , they have to be large . # PM: I mean th the two basic buttons , you know , the to skip channels and to I think , I don't know why , but I think that is that's t trendy too , # UI: Most the most used buttons . # ME: Those are probably the th # PM: because that's the mo it you know , it's acc accentu , how do you say it ? # PM: It puts an extra accent on the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big , like t # ME: Those are probably the b four most used buttons on the th in the remote control . # PM: And you want to acc accentuate that , you know . # ID: You did the research . # ID: It's from your research . # UI: , that was all y personal preference I didn't have . # UI: I didn't had any time left . # PM: No , that's coo it's cool . # ME: You don't care . # ME: Well , I've done some research again about trends on the internet . # ME: I've done some investigation , and well I got some information from fashion watchers from Paris and Milan . # ME: Some some findings the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control . # ME: , well , we were going to imply that , so that's nice . # ME: The second important thing is innovative technology in the R_C_ . # ME: , our market really likes really likes that . # ME: And the third point there in this order if of importance , the third point , is a high ease of use . # ME: And , well , for the idea , I've put some trends for the market of elderly people . # ME: Dark colours , simple recognisable shapes . # ME: So we probably won't do that . # ME: The younger market likes Well , the themes of this year are surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material . # ME: I found this image , which is Well , it symbolises the idea of fruits and vegetables . # ME: I don't see the spongy part in it . # ME: But with a little bit of fancy # PM: Well maybe c then we have to do something with Sponge Bob then . # ME: I got some ideas well , pictures isn't really good word , but some symbols of fruits or vegetables maybe . # ME: , catchy colours . # ME: Fruit is yellow , green , red , whatever . # ME: So , remote controls in catchy colours . # PM: It doesn't stroke with the with the dark colours . # ME: , no , we don't want dark colours . # PM: Not the dark colours ? Okay . # ME: No , I just put them there to , for general idea . # ME: And , the docking st I think the spongy material is very irritating for the remote control itself . # ME: To implement some spongy thing , maybe we can do it in the in the docking station . # ME: At the bottom of the docking station or whatever . # ME: And , we could bring one line with a dark colour to p uh v how do you say ? # PM: For diversity or something . # ME: , also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour . # ME: I mean it reaches a different market , but it doesn't cost really much effort to b to bring like a black R_C_ on the market or whatever . Yes . # UI: But how do we use fruits and vegetables in Christ's sake with remote control ? # PM: No , but I think that our design already resembles so a piece of fruit . # ME: , there's always a # UI: , make it a banana ? # PM: It's like a pear or something . # ME: Well there there's always empty space of course on a remote control . # ME: I mean I think this part of the R_C_ well the upper the upper part or whatever is not used with buttons , I guess . # PM: No , I don't think you have to do it like # ME: So you can put some fruity things # PM: , but it that doesn't have to remind you , you know , like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like the round curves . # ME: No , of course not . # PM: And so y I think this y it already sem resembles something like a pear to me or something . # ME: Especially i # ME: If we make it little bit greenish . # PM: You do get the idea , eh ? The fruity kind of round # ME: A and we could use one of these for the w what is it ? # ME: Wha whatever . # UI: But d don't we need a creative artist or something like that to m make it to feel like a vegetable or fruit ? # PM: , . Of course we have we have a very big the s # ME: Well , w we can w we can we can produce multiple things . # ID: For a big team of artists . # PM: Of d design team , . # ME: This is then the pear . # ME: I don't know the English word , so forget it . # PM: It's pear , I guess . # ME: And , maybe , a b a banana is n not easy for a remote control , but m . # ID: But but I think we don't have to make we can't make all ten designs . # ID: We have to make one design I th I think . # PM: No , but I think it's already what we were up to . # ME: Mayb maybe two or three . # PM: , it's it doesn't have to resemble what I already said , a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like a fruity thing going on . # PM: And it's it looks fruity to me . # ME: B but that's great , and what I was # PM: And , but I do like the # ME: what I was saying , the catchy colours # PM: , I do like the f to the idea of making a y , a catchy colour design and a d because I do I think a dark colour would be nice too . # ID: But pictures of fruit , vegetables # PM: Maybe it's too much , you know . # UI: But , we have to There have to be the firm colours , our own colours has to be in it . # ME: , not really . Pictures was a was a bad word , but # PM: Okay , but what are the This is yellow . # UI: Yellow , a Real Reaction . # ID: Yes , you can put a logo on top of it . # PM: But I don't think our company colours are this fashionable . # ME: Maybe we can if we got our docking station over here . # ID: Yes , it's really fruity . # ME: I can't draw with this thing , but I'll try . # ME: If this is our docking station , we can make our logo over here . # ME: It doesn't work . # UI: , and the button then . # ID: With a strawberry on top . # PM: on n on the bottom of the remote you can do # ME: Well , the button over here or whatever , I don't know . # ME: On the front , of course , because else you can't find it . # ME: Well , that were my ideas a little bit . # ME: I'll close 'em down . # PM: Okay , you can you open the conceptual design presentation ? # ME: Conceptual design , yes . # PM: See what was on the agenda . # PM: This is his own remote . # PM: Because , maybe we can start with the technical functions , but I don't think it's there do we want to use an L_C_D_ display , for example ? # ME: Well , it's nice , of course . But I don't I don't know what to display on it . # ID: Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it , for the channel you're on . # ME: , but it should be li like this big , and I don't think # ID: No , no , only the T_V_ channel with the with four programmes . # PM: I don't think we should do it . # ID: You can zap through them with the page up page down button . # ME: Yes sure , but it has to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite large part of it and then you get a very large L_C_D_ screen , because # ID: Yes , it can On your No , on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also . # ID: So why not on your remote ? # PM: , but no . I do I think it's a bit redundant , actually . # PM: And it's also not I don't th even think it looks s like sexy or something , # UI: Well well what would you display on it then ? # ID: , programme information or g or a guide # ME: Programme information . # UI: But is it isn't that a already on T_V_ , a lot of new T_V_s ? # ID: on t on teletext , yes . Also on the internet . # ME: Well a lot a lot of T_V_s indeed show when you zap to a # PM: But you're already watching the T_V_ , you're not gonna watch your remote control . # ID: Yes , but you also want to know what's next . # ME: But then we also w need to bring out a line of T_V_s which we were planning to , # UI: and we also have to . # ME: but whatever . # ME: Because the T_V_ has to send information back to the R_C_ , and I don't know if that's possible . # ID: Yes , that's really possible . # ME: Yes , yes , o of course it's possible , but you gotta implement it in the T_V_s , and I don't think everyone's gonna buy a Real Reaction T_V_ within a month after the release of our remote control . # PM: I really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an L_C_D_ in it , # PM: but I really don't think it's a good n goo because it also doesn't stroke with we wanted c When we talk about the materials , it's a good idea to use these plastic materials with soft rubber stuff on it . # PM: It was our idea , you know , to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it . # PM: But I don't think a L_C_D_ display fits in that image . # PM: You know , it's like more vulnerable , and it adds nothing really , you know . # ME: That's true , that's true , it breaks f , it it's not very solid , it's frag fragile . # PM: , . You could make it , but it's just it doesn't I don't think it it's coherent with the design we're after . # ME: No . No . I don't think so ei either . # PM: But that's my opinion . # PM: Well , you y Okay , we can vote for it . # PM: You want the L_C_D_ display . I don't want to and he doesn't , so it's up to him . # PM: And I've read somewhere that I've got some kind of veto rights . # PM: So I can also say # UI: We can you away . # PM: But did we skip the , you could do m but what i so what i but do you think we should # UI: , I i if it's a simple p # PM: We're not even sure what information we want to display on it . So # UI: No , that that's right , and I also have to think about new functions , maybe buttons or something like that to control it . # UI: Kind of L_C_D_ or something or # ID: Y yes , you can use buttons uh w that are already on the remote control for double functions . # UI: But how does it display then ? # UI: W when I go to the second channel , what does it show me ? # ID: , then you push a button . # ID: The title and the information about the programme . # UI: About that programme ? # ID: But but , what he said was right , about the televisions , they have to be customised to the # PM: Nah , that's not gonna work . # ID: But maybe in future it will be a giant hit , and when you are the first # PM: Oh , well I've seen it done before . # ID: you have the biggest # PM: Do you know th like the bigger rem universal remotes , they have d L_C_D_ displays , but then it's very functional to indicate which what uh device you are controlling . # PM: So it's that that's what I've seen . # ID: Yes , you can put a little L_C_D_ display on it with lots of information . # PM: But it just it j it doesn't match with the our whole basic concept . # ID: But I haven't thought about it . # ID: But whe but when you put a transparent plastic uh screen on top of it , it i it isn't vulnerable . # PM: Well , okay . That's maybe not the most important , # ID: You can throw with it and # UI: Is it fashion ? # PM: I don't think so . # ID: When when you put maybe a colour L_C_D_ t screen on it , it's very special and very trendy to have a remote control from # UI: That's not up to you . That's up to market if i if it's trendy . # PM: , well do you ha do you have to You haven't looked after the trendiness of L_C_D_ displays , have you ? # UI: Because our motto is we put fashion # ME: Well , I think it's I think it's pretty trendy , to be honest , but I don't know if well , I'm coming back to the costs again , but I think we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to stay within our limits . # ME: And I think especially colour L_C_D_ , which is indeed pretty trendy . But I don't think , I think it will be too expensive . # ID: But I've got a the email with the possibilities . And L_C_D_ was a possibility for the remote control . # ID: So why don't we use it . # PM: , but we're gonna if it # ME: , did it say a price also for monogramme L_C_D_ or coloured L_C_D_ ? # UI: , if you want to be trendy you have to be coloured . # UI: If you have black and white or something , or grey , that's # PM: Then then you better don't , d # ME: I in two thousand and four you can't put something on the market which is a monogramme . # ID: No , but it doesn't sa say anything about a colour or But , mm , I alf I also got a possibility to put a scroll button on it . # PM: I really don't feel the whole idea of an L_C_D_ display . # ID: I didn't think that # PM: It can't co you cannot convince me . # PM: I don't know how well how to with you guys , but I don't really feel it . # PM: We already we're # UI: It's too much maybe with the L_C_D_ and the docking station and # PM: , we already have the th base station gadgets , and want and it uh , do it has to be a simple design , which sturdy , which soft # ID: Yes , but o on the # ME: W we've gotta find a balance , of course . # UI: With one thing special . # UI: Not a whole package of specialty . # PM: I don't think and really , I don't see how the L_C_D_ display is gonna add anything , you know , on a design level . # PM: , I think it's slicker to have no L_ CEDs . # PM: Y we want to it's simplicity , w you have two big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons , so you don't need an L_C_D_ . # ID: But it look Yes , but that remote controls are already on the market . The simple # PM: It doesn't fit in our philosophy behind the whole remote . # ID: Yes , but when you want to have something special # PM: , but we already have the docking station , which is # ID: Yes , but you had a picture of it from another company . # ME: We have a pear . # PM: It has to be developed , but no , but it that's our that's our killer feature . # UI: It's just an it's just an idea . # PM: That's our what makes it special . # ID: Yes , it was already made . Tha the remote control on the docking station . # PM: , we're gonna develop our own r n docking station . # ME: Is that so ? Was it wasn't just a prototype ? # ID: Yes , he have a picture of it . # ME: Exactly , I've never seen it in a store . # PM: , but re we really have to cut this off , I re I know you I get the idea you really like it , you know , the L_C_D_ thing , but I think it's not a good idea , and we have already mentioned all the arguments . # PM: do you guys agre How do you guys think ? # UI: No , it's too much . # ME: I think it's a little too much , . # UI: It's overdone . # PM: Okay , we s skip the L_C_D_ display . # PM: I'm sorry , maybe you can do something if we are at your own place , or make it make it make it happen in your basement or something . # UI: Democratically . # ID: I will rule the world with it . # PM: But for the technical part . # PM: The m material , I think it was a good idea to use the plastic and the rubber . # ID: Yes , maybe a bit of a cushion is # PM: yeah , p Exactly . # PM: This is what it w , but it was already what we're after , you know , to give it , you know , the soft touch in your hands # ME: , for the spongy feel . # UI: With a spongy Bob feel . # PM: and also to , know , like , that is y the b airbag kind of thing . # PM: You can st throw it at your little brother's head . # UI: , you just can drop it . # ME: If you drop it if you drop it the airbag comes out , . # PM: No no , not that comfy . # ID: Maybe it but then we have to look that it w will not be too childish to see . # PM: Okay , that's a that's a good point . # PM: And that's why I like the dark t col dark colour bit , you know , because it may be the design , it's maybe it is a bit of the # UI: But not black I think . # PM: it's a bit nineties maybe , what we're what we're up to rat fun to this point . # UI: Well if it's fruit and vegetables , it have to be colourful . # PM: , that's true , but it has to be a little big solid . # ME: , b , that's what w I was pointing at . # UI: But can we ge uh # PM: It mustn't be too , n you know , th too overwhelming , then when you put it on your just # UI: Can we combine it or something ? with yellow and black ? # PM: No , I don't like the yellow and black combination . # PM: But it is our company colours . Apparently . # UI: , it's our . We we have to use yellow . # ID: Yes , real good colours . # PM: I don't like yellow , and maybe I don't know . # ME: Well , we can as I # ID: But that's not really fruity . # ME: draw really nicely over there . # ME: We can put the logo on our on our base station . # ME: , . And maybe very tiny on the remote control itself . # PM: Okay , but what , what are other tef technical things we have to discuss ? # ID: fronts We can have different uh fronts of the # PM: Should we do that ? # PM: I don't think you we should do that . # PM: Maybe just bring it out in different colours , # UI: Different fronts . # PM: but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards , that's also too much . # ME: I guess that's enough . # PM: People don't wanna spend more money on their remote control , I guess . # ME: That's way too Nokia . # UI: , you can you can l let choose the customer which colour he wants , . # ID: Are these designs ? # ME: , definitely . Just bring more designs on the market . # UI: , Three three or four colours , or something like that . # PM: But , without gon # PM: So , are we through the technical part then ? # PM: So we agreed upon n well , not u unanimously or how you call it , but . # ID: It this a real young and dynamic uh styles . # PM: The materials you mentioned in your personal preferences were all were quite okay . # PM: O o only the last point your # UI: And tita titanium , is it a no ? # PM: no titanium's not out of question , I guess . # UI: It's just like that , th this titanium . # ID: But also w Yes , b bu but when we use s soft # PM: But is it possible to use both the plastic and so soft things and t p titanium , as well ? # PM: Makes it in a homogeneous design . # UI: No , not all , not all of them . # ID: But it then it you can't throw it . It will make a huge noise or break other stuff # PM: It will it will break other stuff w when it's plastic , as well . # ID: when you throw with titanium with your remote control . # ID: titanium is a bit it's a bit harder . # PM: No , but uh , you should ma . # ID: But also on the colours , the young # PM: Okay , think of the possibilities and make it in completely titanium . # PM: Well would it be more trendy ? More chic ? # ME: , I think it I think it does . # UI: , I think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic . # ID: Yes , but a titanium remote control , when you're watching T_V_ or your hands are a little bit sweaty , and the # UI: In trendy things . # ME: On the other hand , if you want to make fruit fruity stuff with # UI: It's cold in the winter . # PM: , but I really like the idea of the plastic and the big kind of thing . # PM: But the question is i then it's , you know , is it fits in our s philosophy to make it sturdy and simple and , know , like # ME: , that's true , that's true . # ID: Sports and gaming . Define # PM: When you make it titanium , it becomes more like some kind of gadget you actually don't need . # PM: And when it's big and plastic , it's like some fun stuff you can always have around . # PM: It's always fun to have something big and plastic around . # UI: You have that M_P_ three player of Nike , I saw . # UI: Isn't that titanium with a little bit of rubber ? # ID: Yes , it's w but it is plastic . # UI: Isn't it Is plastic ? Well , it's titanium looking . # ID: Yes , w we can do that on the on the # UI: , he is . Here he is . # UI: , the I don't know if you know the M_P_ three player of Nike . # UI: 'Kay , that that's very with rubber , so it's very # PM: , that's beautiful . # ID: We can make this as a style too . # ID: , this is just a # PM: Oh , maybe th maybe this is an # ME: , I th I think that's difficult , because that's different material , and then you gotta have like uh two material lines of # ID: No , we c we can make it from the same kind of plastic . # ME: , if it's just a colour which you which you change then , I guess it's nice to have one of these . # PM: No , I do like the idea of maybe a t titanium kind type of body w and then with s plastic colouration around it . # PM: You know , like the soft stuff , but I don't know if it's possible . # ID: I don't have the information . , I didn't got it # PM: But you can't make the plastic give the ti titanium look . # PM: But make it just like shiny . # PM: Maybe we should shou # ID: Like the M_P_ three player . # UI: , maybe that's good idea , . # UI: But if you want to la , last longer than two weeks or something like that , you can maybe # PM: And and maybe we sh should we t I don't know if we should talk about , how much time have we got left ? # ID: , in a lot of other # PM: Forty minutes . # UI: What time does # ID: in a lot of other product categories like even in b in bags industry . , they began with t typical leather bags , but then they became stylish , with all si all sort of colours , and w kind of fon of fronts , like we can use on the telephone and it Like Eastpack began a revolution with it with all this kind of bags and colours and # PM: You putting in different colours . # ID: Yes , and styles . # ID: They have also a kind of roses on it , # PM: Well , it is . It's a possibility . # PM: But , let's think about the bas # ID: Then we can always use the same design for a greater resemblance , but with new with new colours , new # ME: New prints on it . Yep . # PM: But wha th our basic idea y I mean , you gonna we're probably gonna have like two type of materials , like the d b the plastic enclosure and then the pads that surround it . # PM: And and pro and lights . We have to incorporate the lights too . # PM: But , do w gonna are we going to give it a two-tone colour look , like the plastic mould is in one colour and the s the cushion pads around it are in another colour ? # PM: Is that the idea ? Is that a good idea ? # ME: How do you mean ? # ME: Th th the base in a in another # PM: How many colours are we how many colours are we gonna we're uh f # PM: Only five minutes left , by the way . # PM: How many colours are we gonna give it ? # PM: Like two-tone colour ? T # ID: There there are three components three components type . # UI: no , not too much I think . # ID: You have the buttons , the case itself , and the rubber and th # ME: How the buttons . # PM: I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons , and the cushions as well should be in another colour . # UI: Or you just make one colour , maybe with a z a kind of like a big wave or something like # PM: Okay , but not more than # UI: In in another colour . # UI: Not more than two colours I think . # UI: It's a g a little bit too flashy . # ME: No , definitely not . # PM: Maybe we should talk about it on a l in a later meeting . # ID: , or when you use the buttons as black , it you can use two colours as well # ME: Yes , definitely . # PM: But we have to think of some other important things . # PM: oh , the functionalities of the buttons . # UI: The funct , I was I was thinking about th the st do we still want a joystick idea . # ME: No , I think that's too vulnerable . # PM: I think this is okay , so we have the basic . # PM: Then we have the numbers . We have the power button . We have we have a teletext button . # UI: The volume , teletext and # PM: And maybe want to access a menu or something . # PM: Most T_V_s have a menu . # ME: , but that's I was thinking that's gotta be on the television . # PM: , but I think you ha I really need a menu button . # PM: That's just i the only button only # UI: , but wha what kind of menu ? # UI: Is isn't that different from every television ? # PM: No , I think most T_V_s have an a menu nowadays to access the uh screen settings . And so # ME: , if it's c if , I think it's okay to add a menu button for # PM: But that covers all the all the other settings . It covers everything then . # ME: and if the T_V_ doesn't have a menu , then # ID: But then you have to put up and down and left and right # PM: No , you can use the # ME: , you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever . # PM: And you al can also use the normal skip buttons for that . # PM: Th in that way we have like only the numbers , the power button , skip and volume , and then uh ten rem # ME: A mute and a teletext and a menu . # PM: , mute . A teletext and a menu , and then i that's it . # PM: It's all we need . # PM: Okay , another stuf some stuff about the design of the docking station . # UI: Okay , that's not mu not much functions . So # PM: Something important about a s , no , which sh should remind us of the remote itself , I guess . # PM: , in one colour . # ME: Are we gonna do something with the spongy thing there ? # PM: Just use I think the spongy thing already comes forward in the in the in the cushions , pads and things on the s side . # ME: , that's true , that's true . # PM: And we will make it spongy and well , the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did I think this is kind of fruity , you know . Just round shapes with # ME: , it's kinda fruity , and with th with catchy colours uh w # PM: , but we're gonna have to we really have to think I think colours is very important , because it has to be flashy , but and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying , that when you , know , some things is just over the top , and when you have it on your table for more than two weeks , you it just gets annoying , because it's so big and flashy . # PM: , it has to be some level of subtlety , but we have to still have to think of how we manage to get to that . # PM: Guess we're through then . # PM: But we I think also we just so we have to do something with colour but also , I think we have to keep the dark colour thing in mind . # PM: I think that's adds to the too much colour maybe m # UI: Too much colour , i it when you got it in a living room , it's too much maybe # PM: But our des design experts will work that out . # PM: Okay , well I think the meeting will be over within a minute . # PM: So we will wrap up . # ME: Something like that . # PM: Or is there anything we'd like to discuss ? # PM: Well , you will read the minutes in the you can find them in the # ME: In the shared folder . # PM: pro probably . # PM: no , for su for sure because I'm will now type them out . # ID: What are we going to do now ? # ME: You'll see in you email , I guess . # ME: , I don't know . I don't know . # UI: And the other thing is that you don't have kind of prototype or something like that . # UI: You see a kinda prototype you can a little bit more # ID: I will make one in the next twenty minutes . # ME: Construct one , . # PM: But toilet paper roll and # UI: With you laptop ? . # ME: Alright , shall we get back to work ? # PM: I was waiting for the l last message , but # UI: Well you are . We're not . # ID: Back to the pen .
# PM: Okay , welcome to the detailed design meeting . # PM: Again , I'm gonna take minutes . # PM: Oh , we're gonna have a prototype presentation first . # PM: , who's gonna give the prototype presentation ? # PM: Okay . Go ahead . # ID: 'Kay , we've made a prototype . # ID: we've got our aspects from the last meeting . # ID: especially we looked at the form , material and the colour . # ID: we've drawn here the p prototype . # ID: The logo is pretty obvious to see on the on the remote control , it is necessary when you want to build your company f to a level higher . # ID: our interface elements , there are shown in the in the drawing . # ID: Maybe you can point them The functions . # UI: , well the all the functions are discussed I think the most of the functions are uh obvious . # UI: , it's a little bit . # UI: , power button . # UI: then the nine channels . # UI: the volume uh at the side , and the other side is the programmes . # UI: And then we had just two buttons , we place them in the middle , the menu , and for the teletext # PM: Oh no , the mute button misses now . # UI: I thought that was th # UI: Oh , the mute button . # PM: did we want to have a m mute button ? # ID: But that It's here then , in the middle . # ME: Alright , and you gotta point out which is the volume button and which is the programme button . # UI: , well most of them are right-handed . # ID: Most of the users # ME: , but you gotta make it clear on the on # UI: well , I don't have time in anymore on the # ID: Yes , y there will be a p a little a little P_ on that and a little . # ME: , and a and a triangle on that . # UI: Oh , just progr programme above , I think . # ME: Next to that I kinda miss a zero actually . # PM: Wait , there's was one thing I wanted to ask . # PM: , there are different ways for remote controls to do like d I call it teens and twenties . # PM: , y th the two numbers . # ME: All n no , that's kinda dependent on the television . # ID: It's a television . # PM: but do we have do we need extra buttons , for example some have to # ID: Yes , yes , you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be on it , th with the one and a double uh # ME: I think you should add A cross , or whatever . , line . # PM: but you don't you don't actually need them , # UI: May maybe here ? # PM: becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have a couple of seconds # UI: And then a second . # ME: No , that's dependent on the television . # PM: No , I don't think so . # ID: Yes , you have televisions , then you have to , you know , you have to press # UI: Is it depending on television ? # PM: Nah , I don't think so really , because you have a I know some remote controls that don't have these buttons , but you still can , know , obviously you can still select the twenty a number in the twenty or in the ten . # ME: Yes , but uh no remote control nowadays are they come with the television . # ME: Or actually , the other way around . # PM: No , I think I really think it's n because you can when you put a button on it with like one and then a dash , it's the same thing as when you just push the one , because it i it first gives you the functionality of that separate button you also had to apply . # ME: , well but su If # ID: some televisions don't accept that # PM: , because that's i it's for television . It's exact the same thing . # ME: No no . So some television respond differently . # PM: When you push the button , the remote control gives a signal . # PM: I in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it . # ME: Yes , that's true . # PM: The one with dash , that signal gi and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one . # PM: I think it works that way , really . # ME: it works if you haven't got a special button for it , if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a line , which is an empty space . # PM: , but it's exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button . # ID: Yes , but some old televisions you have to click on a special button , then you go to a next level , you can push two buttons . # PM: , but you don't underst you don't understand my point . # PM: I think it's exact the same thing when y # ID: You want Yes , but some television don't support it . # PM: No , but then they would a would also support that button , because it's the same thing . # PM: Listen , with that that's that special but button you're talking about , eh ? # PM: That's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv T_V_ that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash , which you can pu so you can still put another number on it . # PM: When you don't have that separate button , and you push y one , it's exactly the same thing . # PM: Do y you the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had # ME: No , s some televisions need the input first and you c # PM: But you give the input . # ID: so they need no , they need # PM: You push the one . # PM: That's the same thing as the button with the one and it # ME: No , that's not true . # ME: It's simply not true . It's simply not true . # PM: Think about it . # UI: You you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash , and then wait two seconds or something # PM: And it's the same thing what happens and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one . # ME: No , remote control doesn't give signal after five seconds . # ME: Remote control is a stupid thing . # ME: If you push a button , it sends it immediately to the television . # PM: , but I m but it's I know for sure that some televisions that w th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that doesn't sport these buttons , it still works . # PM: But okay , we we'll impl # ME: No , definitely not . Definitely not . # UI: We'll discuss them in the usability lab . # PM: we'll apply them then for now . # UI: eva evaluation . # UI: I don't know I don't know if it's necessary . # PM: , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two . # PM: , for now , if we don't know for sure whether # ID: And the button for the SCART audio video external input . # ME: , you can access that via zero , and then minus , I guess . # PM: What I said about the remote control sending another signal , that might not be true , but I still think i it all T_V_s in some ways support it , I don't know . # PM: I think it's more c is m maybe we don't we both don't really understand how it i how it really works , but I think there's more to in than wha than what you just said . # ID: , remote control sends one signal at one button press . # PM: I do think that m T_V_s support mur multiple kind of remote controls . M # ID: N some televisions when you want to go further than ten # PM: Th won't work wi with # ID: No , you have to you have to give the television two or more signals . # PM: to have that special button . # ID: When you press one button , you give one signal . # ID: And the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher . # PM: Okay , well we'll see . # ID: When you make the technology that it will give more signals , it could work , but Just a basic idea of the most y most common and simple operations on the remote . # ME: I kinda miss the docking station . # ID: It's here on the # UI: Well it , there's nothing I think it's pretty basic , # UI: the there's no fu there's one there's one button , # ME: No nothing really trendy about it . # UI: that's wha there's one function and that's n the one button when you want to find it . # ID: But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh a bit standard for the other products we sell , # ID: because Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls . # ID: So maybe we can use the docking station , for example , M_P_ three players or hearing devices . # ME: I think that's very difficult , because of different shapes of uh devices . # ID: Yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put when the when the when o the lowest part of it , when it's o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same # ME: Well it got it has got to fit into the shape , of course . # ID: but we can make # ME: The technology and the voltage can be the same . That's that's true . # ME: But i if you all make the m having a bottom like this , then they all fit . # ID: No , we can make the most lowest part all the same . # ID: When when the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it . # ID: Just have to be big enough for the biggest # ME: but I g Shouldn't it fall then ? It isn't going to fall down ? # ID: No , when you make it large enough no it will not . # ID: But then it's a little bit # ME: No , but if like this , I'll point it out , if you got a base a base like this , # ID: But it's just an idea . # ME: I won't draw it really . # ME: If you got a base which is as big as this # ID: But it's flat it's flat as this , so we can p make all the products as flat as this . # UI: But i it's backwards . # ME: but if you got if you got a tiny player , it can # ID: Yes , but when you make uh a bit of big # UI: But it's backwards . # UI: It's leaning . It's leaning backwards , I think , in the in the docking station . # ME: , wha what you could do if you from the bottom # ME: oh , right , help . # ME: , you could make like a hole in it , you know , of in the # ID: Yes , little holer littler , little products go deeper in it . # ME: That i that is possible , yep . # PM: Well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later , because maybe we have we have to consider the docking station anyway , because we have some cost issues still to come . # ME: , sure , you're right . # PM: But we have to look n I don't know . # ID: the f the look and feel would be great on this remote control , because you always will pick up the remote control in the in the smallest area . # ME: I don't like the colours . # ID: Then your left thumb of your right thumb is near the programme button , which is the most common used function , and all the other buttons are available for your thumb . # ID: So it's really good design . # ID: Yes , on the side there will be a strip of rubber , and in the middle there is a hard a hard material , a bit hard plastic with a light behind it . # ME: And other lights ? # PM: I think added lights are gonna be a problem too . # ID: Yes , we can make also n neon lights on it , or the buttons that can make light on it . # ME: No , o on the on the front . # ME: Maybe the logo . # ID: But , it will also uh use batteries , # ID: and do we want to # PM: Okay . For now , this is good enough . # PM: , what was on the # ID: The all the aspects of the interface buttons were # PM: but in the oh , the colour , because we're gonna use one colour for the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber , isn't it ? # PM: Then we're gonna do the buttons in the i are we're gonna have rubber buttons . # PM: And they're be a they'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side . # ME: , in the same colour as the side . # ME: , I think I think that'll be good . # PM: And I think we should use a darker colour for the plastic , and maybe some more m brighter and flashy stuff # ID: Yes , maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use uh multiple lights , so it will # PM: , we'll talk about the lights later . # PM: 'Cause I also don , it's depends on the costs and such . # PM: But , and we have to agree upon the exact colours , but may I dunno if that's important , but we'll talk about that later . # PM: Okay , for now this is this is okay . # PM: , the next p y you gonna give a presentation too ? # PM: , I have to see the agenda . # ME: Well , I I'm gonna do something right there , . # PM: Detail design . # ME: We gotta do that on the right the most right-most screen , because the leftmost # PM: Evaluation criteria . # ME: I will be needing that image , so leave it please . # ME: Right , we're gonna evaluate that design according to a few points . # ME: , we g the four of us are going to do that together . # ME: I wanna have a colour over here , come on . # ME: Right , the remote is not ugly , a bit weird sentence , the positive things has to be on the left , so I said not ugly instead of ugly . # ME: , what would you say , we gotta give points to all of these to evaluate that design , and please forget the drawing skills of these guys . # ME: The remote control is not ugly . How do you feel ? # PM: , I think four maybe would be appropriate , because it's , maybe it really depends on taste . # PM: , I mean it's kind of , our design . # PM: so if maybe a lot of people find it really ugly , you know , o other people find it really cool . # ME: Background colour . # PM: I don't know or I don't know how you Casting . # ID: I think I think the fronts will give it a more uh less uglier side , because you can make it in your own # ME: How do you guys feel ? # ME: The different designs . # ID: yes , you can make it in your own more to your own personality or house style . # PM: , but we d we didn't we're not planning to use fronts , I believe . # ME: No , not fronts , but different designs . # PM: With a colour a co a colours . Oh , okay . # UI: No , not fronts . Different designs . Different colours maybe , . # ME: And that's still uh , is a little personal touch , I guess . # PM: Okay , but Oh , maybe we should do three or something that w you know , our # ME: , wha what would you guys think ? Personally . # UI: We can make it a one . # ME: but what is it ? # ID: I think two or three . # UI: , I go for the positive . So I go for two . # ME: I was thinking about three , so I guess # PM: , I was thinking about four , so I think three is # ME: three is a bit oh , what am I doing ? # ME: The remote control's uh that n makes zapping easy . # PM: well , let that let's make that a one . # ME: Antek , you agree ? # UI: Okay , I'll agree . # PM: That's one thing for sure . # ME: You're not Antek . # UI: I'm the I'm the usability , so # ME: I totally agree . # ME: The remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible . # PM: , two or a one , I guess . # PM: It's something we really put work into . # ID: It's all about the buttons . # ME: I would say a one because every button is uh relevant . # ME: And our oh , it's a b . # ME: That's a one ? You agree ? # ME: The remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . # ME: I think we totally succeeded there . # PM: Well maybe a two , because of the menu button or something . # UI: , well menu , maybe . # ME: , that's true . That's true . # ID: Also , the buttons of the one , the two , the digits , # PM: , we don't know if the they're necessary . # ID: o they're used uh # ME: the , m well , you d you've got a point . # ID: yes , three , two . # PM: Came a long way , but not we didn't not # ID: But you can't make a remote control without them , # UI: Because we got # ME: Nay that that's true , that's true . They're definitely needed . # PM: No , w it can also always be more simplistic , but two is # ME: we put it on a two ? # ME: The remote control has got a really trendy look . # PM: , a t I think a two . # PM: , y i it's hard to say from this picture . # ID: we've tried to make it the best trendy look ever . # PM: But I do think it's more # UI: , I will I will make it a three , because . I th # PM: But I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful . # ME: , I agree . I agree . # PM: So so I think maybe it has to score higher on this than on the # ME: I was planning to give it a two , where I give the not ugly # ME: oh , that's true . # ME: You agree on the two ? # PM: I i when you compare to the # ME: Remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . # PM: what's the difference with # ME: , I copied that one . # ME: Well , forget that . # ME: Remote control has got innovative technology implanted . # UI: No . We're not well , maybe the on the side . # PM: you mean the rubber stuff ? # ME: , and the light . # PM: , but we have t we have to talk about the lights . # UI: And the light maybe . # ID: But that that's not innovative . # PM: And I don't u also it's also really not innovative , # ID: Lights lights are # PM: Or seven maybe , . # ME: Why why not a seven ? # PM: , mine is seven . # ID: Because we've tried to make it a little bit innovative , but it but it # PM: it's depends on the on the maybe # ID: With the lights it it's kind of future # PM: No , I think I think actually it's a seven maybe , but there's nothing innovative about it . # ME: , you think the lights are innovative ? # ME: Well , it's n true . , I agree , # ID: But still you can retrieve it when it's when it's gone , with the with # UI: Innovative in generally or just f original for # ME: , you didn't draw the docking station . # ID: Yes . The docking station is a is a little bit innovative . # ME: , it it's I think I think with its # UI: A docking station is innova # PM: , I mean the dock station , but , I think the docking station , it's gonna be a kind of a problem . # ID: It's a part of the remote . # ME: I think more m # ID: And with the speaker on the there's also a speaker . # PM: Well , let's leave it open for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway . # ME: No , well , the agenda says evaluate now , so I think we # PM: Okay , for now it's a six or a seven , sev # PM: six maybe , because # ID: But the retrieval or the # PM: , but I don't I don't know if it's very inno . # ME: , for the retrieval function . # ME: I think that's very innovative for a remote control . # ID: how would you innovate a remote control more ? # PM: , more through like function T_V_ functionalities and # ID: To put it on your head . # PM: you know what I mean . # PM: You have must be innovative technology for remote controls , but more in how you control stuff , not in how you find your # ME: But I d I definitely don't think it's a five , # PM: that's think about it la later on # ME: Remote control is easy to use . # PM: , as a one or a two ma at least . # ME: The remote control hasn't got . # PM: No , I would have seen that one before . # PM: Oh , you skipped one # ME: I've just filled Go away . # ID: You like the buttons . # ME: I found twelve questions so much , but it still is ten . # PM: Remote control will be bought by # ME: It will be bought by people under the age of forty . # ID: and comparing with people of th of the age above ? # ME: No no . No , just if they if they buy it . # PM: , just in general . # PM: , but I think I think two . # ME: , what do you think ? # UI: , I think two , . I agree . Two . # ID: Yes , two , but only in c when you compare it with elderly . # PM: , that is not the question . It's just w it will be bought by people under forty . # ME: No , that's no comparison . # PM: , you can , you can be very picky about it . # ME: And I don't mean two people . # ID: This is just guessing . # PM: , just make it we'll make it a two . # ID: When it succeeds , it can get a two , # ME: Right , the rem The remote control has recognisable corporate image , colour , logo or slogan . # PM: . , you have make an # UI: We don't have the slogan though . # PM: slogan is quite obvious . # ME: Oh , the slogan . # PM: Oh the oh sorry , no , not the slogan . # ME: Can we see the slogan ? # PM: , you can put that on the side if we would like to . # UI: Underneath it or something . # ID: Yes , encrypted with # PM: , and I will I th still think it's gonna be a two or a three . # ME: Are we gonna do that ? # UI: A three . Three . # PM: Maybe a three this time . # ME: Three ? I agree . # ME: Because of the slogan Remote control's got a basic design intended for novice users . # PM: , it's a one or a two . # ME: We gotta add up the scores now to see our total average . # ME: Four , five , seven , nine . Forget that . Fifteen , seventeen , twenty one , twenty four , twenty six . # ME: It's a two point six . # PM: It's not that bad . # PM: , and that's mostly the inno when we score higher on innovative technology , we would score two , which is quite a great score . # PM: , this is was the evaluation ? # ME: This was my evaluation . So # PM: Because I still think that the most important part of this meeting still has # ME: We did a pretty nice job until now . # ID: Is there something after this meeting ? Or # ME: Well , I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire . # PM: Still opened or Okay , finance . Because I received a spreadsheet . # PM: , but I actually don't need this presentation , I guess . # ME: Doesn't matter . # PM: I'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together , because I didn't really fin I have a . # PM: Didn't really finish it . # PM: Well , we We'll see . We'll stumble upon some problems . # ME: We probably will . # PM: I probably have already opened it here . # PM: First of all , the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list . # PM: But let's st start with beginning . # PM: We include one battery . # PM: I i I'll explain its , the components are listed over here . # PM: , price is given . # PM: we indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them . # PM: And then , we'll calcula Don't watch the number yet . # PM: I don't know if it's filled in properly . # PM: Okay , we need one battery . # PM: One battery . I think one battery is enough . # PM: We don't need kinetic , solar cells , hand dynamo . # PM: A s okay , this is a p first problem . # PM: , I think we should know how many simple chips , regular chips # ID: it's one chip , but you have to choose one from it . # ID: The simple chip is e enough I think , but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval , it can be # PM: Where did we find this information ? # ME: I haven't got an idea on which we need to use , really . # PM: I think it was your job in the first meet , f your first presentation to make this clear , but then you had some t time problems . # ID: my The the email I got said simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever device , it will cost a bit more , like I think the advanced chip maybe . # ME: And how do you know ? # ME: I mean , you got that email . Did it point out what to use them for ? # ID: Bec No , the they didn't know about a retriever or a speaker in it . # PM: Maybe you can look it up right now . # PM: Okay , but okay . # PM: When we don't when we leave the retriever and such aside , what # ID: Then it's a simple chip . # PM: then it would be a simple chip . # PM: And with the retriever , it would be an advanced chip . # ME: Alright , well , point out the advanced chip for now , I guess . # ID: That will be enough for future recommendations . # PM: , but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems . # PM: The sample sensor sample speaker . # PM: What is it m is that the speaker we were t I don't know what it is . # ID: I don't know it either . # PM: Okay , we went for the double-curved case made out of plastic and rubber . And with a special colour . # PM: I guess that's what we were # UI: Well , special colour . # PM: , I don't know about the special colour , but I think w # ID: Otherwise , you get a standard plastic colour . # ME: I don't know if it's very special . # PM: , I think we have special colours . # ID: Standard rubber . # ME: Alright , that's okay . # PM: Okay , then the push-button , I was just counting them . # PM: , I think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use , isn't it ? # PM: Well that's bit of a problem , because I re but I really don't understand that , because I can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons , and it wouldn't be possible according to this sheet . # UI: We have the simplest buttons . # ID: it's only when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much . # ME: I don't think so , because it says amount . # ID: If you use a scroll-wheel # ME: The the yellow row is the amount of # PM: Fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost I don't know . # ID: Maybe it's the kind of push-buttons . # ID: You can have f four kind of push-buttons . # UI: Is that one or is that nine buttons ? # PM: And I count them like this . # PM: One two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen . # PM: Because Oh , this is oh , this is one , okay . # PM: Twelve , okay , then it would be eighteen , because , I rated them as uh separate buttons . # ME: that's total of four buttons . # PM: And plus these two , f plus the mute button , and it's will be eighteen . # ME: I think that Eighteen . # ME: One two three four five , si # ID: Why is that so expensive . # PM: , I don't understand . # PM: Y I do I don't get the point , because it's would be s relatively so expensive , just these m small buttons . # UI: Is it cents , the fifty cents a button ? # ME: Fifty cents for one single stupid button . # ID: So , whe when you so then it # PM: Well , okay , well let's make it just one . # ID: It's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of # PM: Here , now it's now it's already s # PM: shall we just give our own interpretation to , because else we would really have a problem . # PM: It would be impossible to make it # ME: I couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh per button . Really . # ID: When you have the same amount of button , you have to put in wi in your carton . Board . # PM: And and less buttons than this isn't possible . # ID: And then throw it # PM: This is the most simple # PM: , it is possible , but I've never seen one before . # ID: But whe I've seen one remote control with only the pu , only with page up , page down and volume , # PM: , without the numbers . That's possible . # PM: , we could skip the numbers . # ME: , but I d I wouldn't want to own that . Really . # UI: That's still four . # ID: , it's still for little children . # ID: They can handle that remote control , # PM: Then , teletext would also be im impossible . # ID: but it isn't fo it's for it's li it's just for a little # UI: , that's no option , that's no option . # PM: Okay , we'll just But then still , when we there's no room for a docking station or something . # PM: Tha w Le let's see th we have oh , button supplements . # PM: We'll give the buttons special colour . # PM: We'll give them a special form . # PM: , I think we should mark the special form thing , because it this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons , I guess . # UI: A special colour , why a special colour ? # PM: Because the buttons will be d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings . # UI: But wha what s what special ? # PM: I think that's the what they mean by a special colour . # ID: Otherwise , it Otherwise it would be the # ME: I don't think the special form is really true . # PM: I think all the special colour things have to be marked over here , because that's what we were planning to do , making it # ID: Special form also , it says . # PM: , special material r also , because i has rubber . And the buttons have to be rubber . # ID: What is the normal material ? # UI: Plastic , I think . # PM: 'Kay , but the problem now is that the There's no such thing as a docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents . # ID: But we can sell the remote control and sell the docking station # ID: And and but we don't have to tell it , but what we can say of can almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station . # PM: , but I do like the idea , but we . # PM: It but it then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore , but we can # ID: No , but you otherwise you can't retrieve it . # PM: but then you still have to use we have to find out what chip we u need . # ME: , I really don't get it . # ME: I mean if it's a simple chip , then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents . # PM: I think we can agree on this . # PM: I think the special colour thing has to be marked . # PM: 'Cause I think we , I think that's what they mean # ID: But for two Euros and thirty cents , we don't get a docking station . # ME: I think so , too . # ME: Oh , I don't know . # PM: But can we find out about this chips ? # PM: Because when we don't need a d a docking station , then probably we also have only we also need a simple chip . # UI: And then we can get a docking station . # PM: And maybe then we can do something extra . # PM: Oh , n oh , still oh , it's gonna get more expensive with . Two . # PM: Then we have some money left . # PM: We can put then # ID: For two Euros . # PM: We can put a scroll-wheel on it or something . # PM: , well who knows . # PM: Or a little bit of tin titanium . # ME: I mean i if you if it would cost two Euros , that had a total a total thing , it would be nice too , I mean we're not gonna add a trip to Hawaii to it . # UI: But what can we do # PM: or we can ki do the kinetic cells . # PM: That's also maybe an idea . # UI: But what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ? # PM: that's what then what he has to find out . # PM: Maybe you can find it in your email right now , then we know then we exactly know what it will cost us . # PM: Maybe is that that's nice to know . # UI: Regular chip and because we don't have special functions to use in advanced chip , for example . # PM: bu but when we , but when we skip when we when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station , then we still , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special , # ME: I like the hand dynamo part . # PM: because that was our special feature . # ME: We can make a plain docking station for two Euros . # UI: We'll go back tomorrow . # PM: , okay , you can also do that , but maybe # ME: Wi wi without recharge # PM: It still is a special remote control cons you know , wi its form is special and material . # ME: but we can make a docking station for two Euros if you don't put the recharge function in it . # ME: I mean , it has a shape . # PM: but for two Euros , then we have still maybe we have to use the advanced chip , # ME: Of course it has a shape , but i # PM: then two Euros isn't even possible . # ME: Why should that not be possible ? # PM: because then we'd thirty cents left . # ME: for the for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip . # PM: , but , I don't know , because maybe d , we have to find out with the simple chip . # UI: That's the question . If we do i do we need an advanced chip , or is it okay f # PM: and w and we need f # ID: It isn't in my information , so I don't know it either . # PM: and what is this ? Sample sensor sample speaker . # ID: It isn't in my information , I've got a schematic view of the remote control , but nothing about advanced chips or # PM: You can look at it for s presentation . # PM: S technical functions ? # ID: I've got here in # UI: No no , they were mine , . # ID: I will put a I will put a page on it . # ID: When my mouse works again . # ME: Reanimate it . # ID: I will put my email on the network . # ME: What the hell are these ? # PM: I don't think here it's in here already . # UI: It's circuit board . # UI: It's only just basics for # PM: It's nothing about s . # UI: At the end circuit there is an infrared LED . # ME: This isn't helpful . # PM: But i in the presentation of yours , there was also something about different components . # PM: Which one was it ? # UI: Components design . # PM: Functional requirements ? # ME: No , that was my presentation . # UI: Components design maybe . # ID: Yes , that was mine . # PM: yes , it was the second one . # ID: But that was my second # PM: , it was your second # ME: It's already open . # PM: your first presentation . # ME: It's at the bottom . # UI: Working design . # ME: It's at your task bar . # UI: , but it's the other one . # PM: , this is n this is not this n # UI: Was it working design or components design ? # PM: that's not the right one . # PM: No , this is the other one . # PM: Or maybe something is maybe there's something abo in these # ID: But this is the same This is o only the possibilities . # ID: We can use a simple , a regular , or advanced chip . # ME: , nice . I it doesn't say anything . # UI: The display requires an advanced chip . # PM: You know that a push-button requires a simple chip , but a scroll-wheel , it me requires Okay , so we only need a simple chip . # ID: With the light . # UI: Little lights . , but that that's just the same as the LED . # PM: No no , that's just a simple chip . # PM: A scroll-wheel # ME: That's not needed . # PM: it s only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip , and that a display requires an advanced chip . # PM: So , we don't need any of them . # ME: A display is , of course , for showing letters . For showing text . # ME: I don't think that just a l a little light # UI: I think the normal simple chip will be okay . # PM: And what's the sample sensor slash sample speaker ? # ID: Maybe you can say against the remote page f page up , page down . # ME: , I guess so too . # UI: Well , that's not too what we want . # ME: Next channel . # ME: Well , we might want it , but # ID: All in twelve Euros . # PM: Back to the costs . # ID: Twelve Euros and fifty cents . # PM: So we're gonna use the simple chip . # UI: So , simple chip is okay . # ID: And the lights . Where are the lights ? # UI: , lights , there's no # ME: Well , there're three , I guess . # PM: Nah , there is some money left to be spent . # UI: Can we do it wi within two Euro ? # ME: I think we can make a docking station . # PM: Okay , but what we have to think about now is that is it still a special remote control ? # PM: But I mean it isn't it hasn't got any innovative technology , we aren't gonna apply any innovated innovative te technology anyway , I think . # PM: I don't I don't see any possibility to do so , because it would wouldn't fit our defi design philosophy . # UI: But it's original . # PM: But what w is there some extra # ME: No , that's true . # PM: maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something . # PM: Instead of the rechargeable the rechargeable thing was something to know , so y so people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore . # PM: Maybe we if we put the kinetic thing in it # ID: But but sometimes you put a # PM: , you leave the p , I know , but still I they will think about that . # PM: I mean if you u # ID: Kinetics aren't nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking . # PM: The it's made for s people well , the they don't if it was uh r useless technology , they wouldn't put it as a possibility . # ID: solar cells are useless . # PM: And i it th the target # ME: Or the hand dynamo # PM: the target group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking . # PM: Because I think it when there w was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic uh power source , then it would be this one . # PM: Because it's one it gets thrown around thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot Hey that maybe that's cool that's a cool thing about it , you know . You don't use batteries . # PM: I've never seen it before in a remote control . # UI: But then we could make a docking station . # ME: I don't know if Five minutes . # PM: No , we can't make a docking station anyway . # ME: That's not true . # PM: , we can als or also m we can make one # UI: Wow , w why no li # ME: We can make a docking station for two thirty . # PM: we can still make # UI: Look at now , we got two # ID: Fo for a docking station . # UI: two thirty left . # UI: Ca can't we make a docking station of that ? # ME: We can make a docking station . Sure . # ID: With a cable , with buttons on it , with retrieval device in it . # ME: The power device is i is very cheap . # ME: That's just a regular power cable and whatever . # PM: , but be serious , then the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control . # ID: Wi with a button to # ID: wi with a button to retrieve it , so it will beep . # ID: , so it's wireless technology . # PM: but we don't inc we haven't looked at the these costs of the speaker and other stuff . # PM: I don't think it's realistic for you to do so . # ME: Well then it's a useless project . # ID: Look at the case , # PM: Oh , because we # ID: the case the case of # UI: , then we don't have any innovation things . # PM: We well look at all the special stuff we have . # PM: Colour a the colours are special , the form is special . # PM: It th this is whole concept . # PM: maybe it with the kinetic thing , I think we could do a compromise with the kim kinetic thing . # ME: Can't we Can't we say fifteen Euros ? # ID: No , then we have to sell it for thirty Euros . # UI: No , we only make less profit of it . # ME: You can sell for twenty seven and a half . # ME: Then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs . # PM: my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing and make it like a I still fee I also feel this concept of making it kinetic , because of the you know , it g it gives something dynamic to the remote control . # ID: Maybe we can do it both . # ID: Maybe we can do it both in the in the in the remote . Battery and kinetic . # PM: No , that wouldn't n no . # ME: Thirteen twenty . # PM: , and it is also not a good it's not you have to really do it only kinetic , you don't want it to think about batteries anymore . # ME: And I think only # ID: Yes , but when it's then when it # ME: , but only kinetic , then you gotta # ID: then you have to shake it and all when it's when it's empty . # ME: You you gotta throw it through the room like twenty times an hour , really . # PM: No no , this is very sophisticated technology . # PM: When you use it your remote like once a day , or maybe even less i it # ID: You asked for three d No , that's n that's not true . # ID: , a watch is kinetic because you walk all the time . # PM: It We can make it no . # PM: Becau be but a remote control gets why do they state that this technology can be used if it # ID: Yes , solar cells are also stated . # PM: , m but a w uh n a calculator also works on r on solar cells . # ID: Why don't we use solar cells then ? # PM: Because I think the d whole dynamic part , do you know , appeals to me qui thinking of our design philosophy , you know , with the rubber parts and sturdiness of the thing , and y when you move it around a lot , then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and # ME: , it's funny for a week . # ME: I guess something like that , where you have to move it around very frequently , is demotivating . # PM: , but you don't have to . # PM: The idea of this technology is that you don't think about it , it just happens . # ME: No , I don't move my remote control very much , seriously . # PM: Okay , then we d Okay , well y we don't have to do it , but what that would just have a lack of key features , you know . # PM: You m have to put something on your box . # PM: You have to make people buy it and We can really can do the docking thing , it's not , we can do it , but it's would be a easy way out . # ID: You can do it for fifty cents . # ME: Well , we've got more than fifty Cents . # PM: Okay , but we have to grou to agree upon something , # ID: The c The case the case alone is # PM: because we only have a minute left or so . # ID: the case alone for remote control is at least one Euro . # ID: Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station . # PM: No no , it's not possible . # PM: Okay , w b we can s we can leave it on be well then th it's this is then our concept is ready . # UI: Cheap remote control . # PM: , we make some extra profit of it . # ME: No , we won't , but that's something else . # UI: It w it won't tell , but # ME: No , this not gonna sell . No . # PM: Huh , any ideas ? # ME: Of course not . # ID: Great . It's great . # UI: , we just have to go all what we did today again . You have to do it over . # ID: Our remote control . # ME: We come back tomorrow , okay ? # PM: No no there's still there's still someth concept and something special left . # ID: Seventy Euros . # PM: I mean we're gonna it's gonna excel in on in the range in the field of design and looks and feel . # PM: That's what it's makes it special . # PM: , and I would li I would have liked a kinetic part as well , to give it some just to give it some extra special feature , and I know it will work , but it's an They're they're not putting technologies on this , but if it if it was impossible to make it happen . # ID: Why not a hand dynamo then ? # PM: Okay , well we leave it like this . # PM: Then it's c then we're . # ME: We can't do anything else . # ME: Warning , finish meeting now . # PM: Okay , project e # PM: well , we were gonna what look take a look at the last sheet . # PM: , we have to , it's # ME: Yes , yes . Celebration . # ME: I don't see why , but # ID: Where's the champagne ? # ME: I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire , to be honest . # ID: I don't hear a bell . # UI: We can do it here then . # ME: Alright , I'll see you guys in a minute . # UI: can't we do it here ? # ME: I don't think so . # ME: I don't know . I don't I don't think so . # ID: Just fill that one in . # UI: , we're doing now .
# ME: Throwing away my toothpick . # ME: Nice user interface . # PM: What the well , ja well let's just start . # PM: I've made a presentation but I'll open it on the Smartboard , so we can all see it . # ME: Right let's see it . # PM: So it's in the project documents because that's what we can find here . # PM: Well this is called the kick-off meeting . # PM: So I'm the Project Manager , so I had to fill it in , Oh sorry . # PM: And an a nice agenda . # PM: we'll do the opening and then we'll meet each other , what we already do , so , that's not very much trouble . # PM: I'll show you the tools we have here , so that we can all use them . # PM: Then we'll look at the project plan from Real Reaction . # PM: We'll discuss about our first ideas about the project , and then we'll close the meeting , and then we can individually do our things and then we'll get back here . # PM: So this the opening we'll We have to design a new television remote control . # PM: You have heard that already I think , so . # PM: we want it to be original , so a nice a nice new design . # PM: trendy , it's also for young people , and we have to just make it modern . # PM: And friendly , so size does matter . # PM: And Well it has to be a have the right the right buttons on the right place , that kin those kind of things . # PM: There happen to be three stages . # PM: functional , conceptual , and d detailed design . # PM: so every time we we'll do some individual work , get meeting , talk about it , and then go into the next phase . # PM: That's just it . # PM: We have these two Smartboards . # PM: well as I just showed , there's a project management folder , a project document folder on the desktop . # PM: It just works exactly the same as a computer . # PM: You just click on the on the folder and you open the everything you put in it with your laptop . # PM: So you can make Words Excel , everything . # PM: and the w the r the rest also works the same so when you open a notepad you just get your things , you can draw . # PM: This is a well a drawing board . # PM: you have a these different functions on the board . # PM: You can see them there . # PM: So you have a nice pen , and it's works just like a bal ball pen . # PM: This is just a . # PM: I want to Of course w doesn't work any more . # ID: Maybe you should try to write on the on the big white # PM: It's fantas fantastic . # PM: We can uh well you can save a file . # PM: So if we draw we have to save everything . # PM: Don't throw anything away . # PM: just we can start a new one , and we just go on , and don't throw anything away . # PM: Just let them all stand here . # PM: We can delete , but we don't do that . # PM: you can here select a pen , you can draw anything you want . # PM: It's a bit childish you have to write . # PM: It's not as fast as you w you know it , but it does work sometimes . # PM: Well it's just like a normal paint . # PM: Well we are designers , so we have to have a more a Smartboard . # PM: So that's fantastic . # PM: well this speaks for itself . # PM: We going to try it . # PM: So we all are going to draw a nice animal on this board , not my idea . # ME: Alright , your favourite animal ? # PM: Yes our your favourite . # PM: So I'm to going to have to draw a kangaroo , but I'm going d I'm not going to . # PM: I'm just going to well draw a nice beast # ME: Grizzly bear . # PM: w I dunno what I'm going to design . # ID: I hope this was part of the assignment and not your I hope this was part of the assignment and not your personal enjoyment . # PM: I just said it's not my idea but I am the Project Manager , and officially this is my idea . # ID: I understand . # ME: We're kinda losing time , though . # ME: We're losing time , but # PM: the first the first meeting is just a bit loose , loosen up , a bit meeting each other # PM: well uh nice . Sh # PM: I hope our Industrial Designer does this better because this is # ID: Don't count on it . # ME: Do we have to guess ? # PM: Well I should make it an hippo now . # ID: I think it's a mouse or a rat . # PM: No I don't think so . # PM: Well what is it , huh ? # ID: It's a hedgehog . # ME: I don't know how to call it . # PM: difficult English word . # PM: I didn't knew it myself . # ID: Well I'm amazed about your drawing skills . # PM: Our characteristics sum it up . # PM: Well it's very painful those kind of thing . # PM: So we can just We're going back and now our Industrial Designer can draw its most favourite animal . # ID: I am the Industrial Designer . # ID: Chief , I am the Industrial Designer . # PM: Oh but this marketing designer . # ID: I think It's pr it resembles the animal drawn by . # PM: what kind of animal is that then ? # ID: I think can I say it ? # ME: Looks very nice , right ? # ID: It looks amazing . # PM: What are you going to do ? # UI: We want to erase it . # PM: save it and start a new save it and start a new black doc a blank document . # ID: These are very impor These are very important documents , of course , these drawings , # PM: well we have to save everything # PM: so now the next one and then save it and start an blank document . # PM: There's also different colours and different well pen widths the line the thickness . # PM: So well you should try it but # ME: I should have made mine a white rabbit . # PM: Well y you could have but . # ID: And he deliberately draws a animal we don't know the English word for . # PM: It speaks for itself . # ID: It looks like an # ID: It looks like that beast from Sesame Street . # ME: You're standing in front of it , # ME: Alright , thank you . # ME: it's a bird , but what kind of bird ? # PM: It doesn't draw circles that easy . # ME: You have to push harder . # PM: just a bit a bit childish , # ID: But we have do we have to name the specific species of the bird ? # ME: Release your anger . # UI: It's just a bird . # PM: Well save the document # ID: Well wonderful . # PM: and then And then a new blank document for . # PM: will choose a new colour and a new pen width so w we can all see it . # ID: Why do I have to do the difficult tasks ? # PM: No well first And then you go to format I think , and current colour # ID: current colour . # PM: you choose a new colour . # PM: And a new pen width also format . # ID: oh they don't have pink . # ID: Oh b oh think this is # PM: It's not like in paint . # PM: And you can choose a nice one . # PM: With each other . # ID: And I can draw ? # PM: So . Just a wa that's the way we do it's quite easy . # UI: It's a pussy cat . # ID: Oh the line width is too thick , but oh well . # PM: Well then you change it . # PM: And erase things . # ID: It smiles nicely . # ID: Now I have to change the line width . # ID: These are whiskers , you know . # ID: well I think it's obvious right now . # ME: No it looks great . # ID: Well if this isn't obvious # PM: save it and start a new blank document . # ID: I'll save it alright save . # PM: So that's what we're going to use when we need it . # ID: Well I feel comfortable now . # PM: Well it's terrific , eh ? # ID: Thanks for this exercise . # ID: I feel totally at ease . # ME: It's good for group spirit . # UI: It certainly is . # PM: We're one big happy family now . # ID: something like that . # PM: Well then the serious stuff . # PM: We're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally so but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars , but twenty five Euros . # PM: Our profit aim is , worldwide , fifty million Euros . # PM: So I didn't exactly calculate how much we have to sell . # PM: we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros so , keep that in mind when we talk about our materials an f and stuff , and marketing research . # PM: Now then we all we can sit down and discuss what do we think about our current remote controls , first about design about aim in the market etcetera ? # PM: Well we c we can sit down because presentation can wait . # PM: We can take notes and Well who has some remarks about the current remote controls ? # ID: Well I didn't have to prepare anything about # ID: it's not , it's not my task to talk about experience with current remote controls , # PM: Well just w we're four if we if we would just have one then # ME: I think it's im it's important to look at the remote controls of our competitors . # ME: Get the good points try to merge them into one universal remote control . # ME: On our corporate site I saw a new D_V_D_ player we're gonna produce . # PM: That's alright . # ME: Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player # PM: That would be a nice idea , yes . # ME: so you can use your television and your D_V_D_ player with the same remote control . # ME: Furthermore it's important to make it acceptable for the whole world , for different cultures , maybe , because we want to we want to well fifty million ? # PM: Yes fifty million is our aim to a profit , so . # ME: so a lot of people have to be able to use it . # ID: No but the b the buttons have to have to have international recognisable buttons and # UI: Easy to learn . # ID: and numbers and that every culture in , people in every country can recognise . # PM: I'll make notes and then maybe well I'll put it in the project folder when I'm done just now . # UI: I also think we should not add too many buttons . # PM: No that's right . # UI: Modern day remotes have too much buttons I think . # PM: Y y you don't use the half of them that's # PM: culture international . # ME: Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_ and make the other buttons multi-functional or something . # ID: so it doesn't become too complicated with too much buttons and # PM: and maybe we do we even have more than just a D_V_D_ player . # PM: Don't we have other ou # UI: we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use , we make ? # ID: And stereo s audio installations . # PM: We also just released a T_F_T_ thing I saw . # ME: so but th that's kind of standard T_ television so it also works on that . # UI: And I think the people who will buy our remote already have some experience with remotes . # UI: So we can keep that in mind . # ID: Most people do , . # PM: It doesn't have to be , but we can . # ID: it doesn't have to be # UI: W well it's a n it's a new remote and you don't buy a remote if you don't have anything to control with it . # PM: Well except if we deliver it together with our D_V_D_ . # ME: We need to keep it consistent with other d # PM: because we look at competitors and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design # ME: but it's it has to be useable . # ID: It has to be different and familiar at the same time . # UI: we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things . # ID: the shape will have to be recognised . # ID: I thought about like most remote controls are a long box shaped thing you can make it triangle shaped , # UI: Well we could make more oval or something , and # ID: but that's not very recognisable . # PM: N we can use it as a as a game pad . # PM: So one hand has the beer , so the other hand # ME: Not with two hands . # UI: but young people want something different and it is # PM: Well i we already # ME: but it's quite important that it fits . # PM: one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so # ID: Oh but it ha it has to be m But you still have to know it's a remote and not another # PM: Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes we have to we can imagine # PM: because it's a long time on the market . # PM: So the form will have been tested out so # ID: so the long box shaped thing must be , useful or else they would have been ano another shape . # PM: for me personally I have a lot of remotes at home but those ones that have a round ending and well just an square middle I don't like to use them . # PM: I have to it has to fit my hands . # PM: When it falls over it and I just have and then the button that I use most has to be here . # ME: It shouldn't be boxy . # ID: a lo the long box shape . # ID: You have to use one hand . # PM: It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with thumb . # ME: I don't agree with the long box shape # ME: it has to be custom made for the hand . # UI: it doesn't fit . # PM: Tho tho those new D_V_D_ players on the market do have those . # ID: But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape , # ME: but if you shape it # ID: but then you have # UI: No if y if you look at new Phillips D_V_D_ with their remotes pl players they are the new remotes aren't box shaped . # PM: D_V_D_ players . Yes . # ID: W no w what else ? # ME: No that's ol old fashioned . # ID: well but what do you suggest then ? # ME: I can imagine that us # UI: Well most of them are somewhat thicker at the end , and get thinner towards the other end . # ME: It fits in your palms . # ID: but it's still then the long box , but then with some round forms in it to fit your hand , # PM: A it h it has it has a that's tha th shape that it fits your hand . # ID: but it's still al alright but it's still it's still sort of box , . # ID: It it has round forms but it in the end it's still the box , so that's what I mean . # ME: but it has it has to fit your hand . # ID: I understand , but no I don't mean an entire box like completely square # ME: It shouldn't be too boxy , you know . # ID: but a also with round edges of course , but in at the end it's still this long box shape with convenient round shapes to fit . # ME: maybe something like this and then a button here to switch between different systems like D_V_D_ player # ID: I thought about something like that . # ME: and so you can I've # ID: A big recognisable button on top or something . # ME: I do think we have to keep this kind of idea with the with the numbers and # PM: We have five minutes left . # ID: The buttons should also be not too small , not too big , of course , and n uh not too close together . # ME: But it should be possible to make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button . # ME: So there has to be some space between the buttons . # ID: of course to have icons to explain the different functions . # ME: right , and maybe we should use colours . # UI: maybe we can just like on cell phones those well you can you can put on them , # UI: and so you can customise your own remote with different colours or special paint jobs # ME: That's kinda trendy . # PM: Sound nice . Yes . # ID: I think we have to talk also about the materials for # PM: Well it's just about our first ideas now so I think individually we'll have to come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera . # ID: Already thought about something tha # ME: I think it's important to notate all the decisions that we make , # PM: Well thirty minutes we have . # PM: This is about what we are going to do . # PM: You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so it's logical . I think . # PM: Oh and that's all . # PM: So we'll just get a notice that the meeting is over . # ID: now we can still talk about the material , # ID: we have some minutes left I w wrote down that the case should be plastic of course , hard plastic , the buttons should be rubbery I think . # ME: it shouldn't be too heavy . # PM: Well I have had remotes that they had the function of the buttons was about uh a layer over the buttons and when I've had use it much it was gone . # PM: So it has to be made in the buttons I think . # PM: It has to not be loose . # UI: that's important . # ID: And of course there are several electrical cables in it to connect things to each other . # PM: Is there an a universal way of transmitting from the remote to the television so it's all about # ME: it's univ yeah . # ID: It's a common stan standard way # PM: It's not that in China it's different ? # ID: infrared beams an infrared beam I think . # PM: But y you can have of course different between D_V_D_s and televisions and between # ME: And you can use # ID: It it's a we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with all kinds of brands and things . # UI: But our T_V_s are mostly made in China and that sort of country , so # PM: Probably yes . # ID: And have well I've wrote something down about how it works . # ID: The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly , # ID: but that's pretty obvious , I think . # ME: Are we going w with the front fronts idea ? # PM: Well I think w we can look into that in the in the next thirty minutes . # ME: I think we should make it universal and you can always use a front on it , you know ? # ME: You can use it just plain but you can To make it more trendy . # PM: Well j just y you get a n a normal front with it , but you can change them when you buy the # PM: And we should dispatch those kind of fronts a around the world so # UI: Well you can make profit with them , and it's a way to make them trendy . # PM: Well th those fifty million don't se sells itself so we have to make some extra effort like fronts . # ID: Well but th but the standard front will be just grey or something # ID: b a simple colour not very flashy . # PM: well it has to it h it has to fit the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell , # UI: No a colour everyone accepts . # PM: if they are black and black and silver we'll make them black and silver so # ID: Pink television sets pink remote , . # ME: But people of often don't like bright colours or something . # ME: We have to make it grey or s or black . # UI: Well young people s li # ME: but then you can use a front . # ID: I must not forget my pen the next time . # PM: Well if you If you have a television room for little children and you make a if you buy a pink front they'll love it . # PM: But that's marketing research you can you can ask . # ME: or a t Teletubby front . # ME: I will investigate . # PM: Well our user interface you can maybe I don't know what your specific instructions will be , but probably about the precision of the buttons and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the remote . # PM: And you will look into the technical design and form , I think . # ID: Mm also the look and feel of the remote's also my task , . # PM: Or something like that . # UI: What's the url or the website 'cause I didn't get # ID: I w was wondering that too . # ID: Y you went to the company website . # ME: It's yeah just if you start up your Internet Explorer # ID: It's the start starting page # UI: Oh oh right oh well I didn't use it . # PM: Finish meeting now . # PM: Well we're going to back into our rooms so # ME: Well that's great . # UI: Next meeting is in # PM: In thirty minutes , but I think it will be you will be warned through your laptop to get over here . # UI: Thirty minutes . # ME: Thirty minutes . # UI: alright it's handy to know # PM: I'll have to restore my desktop # ID: Very handy to know . # ME: It's totally broken . # PM: because it's the half of the normal size . # ID: Right see you in half an hour then . # PM: W that was a nice meeting . # ID: Right see you in thirty minutes then .
# PM: Well I'll start just with another presentation , so then we can look at th at the agenda for this meeting . # ME: Alright , great . # PM: I've put some new things in the in the map . # PM: I don't know the shortcut , so Well our functional design meeting , that's the stage we're in . # PM: And you also ha all three of you have prepared something about it . # PM: Well in we'll just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we thought we had dec decided . # PM: then we'll look at the three presentations from you . # PM: I think you have prepared all three ? # PM: we'll look at th the new project requirements we I dunno . # PM: Y you also have received that mail , the new project requirements from our bosses ? # PM: Oh I've received a mail with some additional requirements , # ME: You're the only one . # PM: and I'll have a look if # PM: Well I think we should show them before your presentations , because it's not really smart to include some things we can't , because of the new requirements . # PM: Well then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions . # PM: We have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be . # PM: And then we can discuss some more closely . # ID: We have forty minutes for this discussion ? # PM: Well the closing we'll not look at it yet . # PM: now I'll look at show this board . # PM: Well notes , first meeting . # PM: I gave a disc a presentation . # PM: we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas . # PM: So we said that we have to merge the strong points from our competitors , and look at their remote controls . # PM: We should make it compatible with our new D_V_D_ and other releases we have , our technical releases . # PM: not too many one buttons . # PM: One recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with . # PM: And well they can have two functions , because you have a D_V_D_ and a television . # PM: the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar . # PM: It's one of our ideas . # PM: well that wa It's just thirty minutes ago , so it's not quite But well I have to do it . # ID: , now it's right . # PM: The materials well should be hard plastic with rubber from , and well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible . # PM: It should be recognisable at all times . # ID: It's meant to be easily wiped out , . # PM: Well fronts were to be just like mobile telephones . # PM: And the technical aspects And also labelling of the buttons , the functions should be universal standards . # PM: Well that's just some ideas from the first meeting . # PM: It's quite logical al all of it . # PM: now the new project requirements , I'll just show them . # PM: I got this mail from our bosses . # PM: Well , teletext goes out . # PM: We will not use teletext . # PM: Maybe a new sort of thing , but n but not teletext . # ID: I disagree , but it's not t it's not my place to disagree I guess . # PM: the second is a bit sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_ and they don't want it , because of our time we have for this project . # UI: Oh , that's a shame . # PM: So that's a shame , because especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years . # PM: Because we don't have those customers a lot at th at this point . # PM: well it's a bit pity because it's just those people want to have one remote control for all those technical devices they can reach it . # ME: But let's forget about it . # ME: It's just time-consuming , so we have to go on . # PM: Well and our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . # PM: So we have to use maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and well on our remote controls the design has to be , well as we already said a actually , familiar . # PM: not only just the shape but also our company . # ID: , we are a real fashionable company . # ID: I read I read it on the I didn't know what company we were , but we design especially trendy stuff . # ID: So it has to be a modern design . # ID: That's important to know , when you design a thing of course . # PM: I noted our slogan that we have , our company . # PM: It's we mm put the fashion in electronics . # PM: So maybe that's a slogan we can put somewhere on our remote control or something . # PM: Alright then we're going to have three presentations . # PM: You want to start ? # ME: I think I have to start . # PM: Oh you have to start ? # PM: I didn't see anything about who had to start . # ME: Oh no , no problem . # PM: Well s then start . # ME: I just have to think which file's mine , 'cause I was bit in a hurry . # ME: I think it's this one . # ME: But I'm not sure . # PM: You already opened PowerPoint . # ME: Yes . This is it . # ME: Well , I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements . # ME: to start with these points . # ME: at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current controls , because it's a smart thing to exclude those things . # ME: , furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use . # ME: then I tell something about the most important issues . # ME: So we have to focus on those three thing three things . # ME: And in the end I'll show you our target audience or our target product users , customers . # ME: Well , the first findings are that people think most controls are very kind of ug ugly . # ME: That's seventy five per cent of the current users . # ME: They don't like it , so we might think about fronts in that section . # ME: They also say , that's about I thought it was fifty per cent , that more money will be spent on better looking controls . # ME: So it's very important that you design a nice looking control . # ME: the current user uses his machine just about well all of the time for a few functions . # ME: , almost every user uses it d the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . # ME: So it's really important to make the buttons for the common tasks kind of big or kind of flashy . # ME: Furthermore , it's seventy five per cent of the users zaps a lot . # ME: Thus it might be might be smart to make a big zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb . # ID: You can zap away . # ME: A lot of losers users lose their controls in their in their living room . # ME: So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that's your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily . # ME: I dunno , maybe that's an idea . # ME: 'Cause it's a big I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room . # PM: It should actually It should actually be loose from the television , because it can also be used for other televisions . # PM: So if you deliver a small click-on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it . # ME: but what if you lose your click-on device ? # PM: you can click it on your television . # ME: but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ? # PM: in another room , . # ME: Nee but it specifically says it's the control is lost in the same room . # ME: Well a beeping device would be # PM: Well we'll have a look at it , . # ME: furthermore the learning time is a problem . # ME: thirty four thirty four per cent thinks it's too difficult to learn . # ME: So the learning curve should be very short for the dumbest people should be able to use it . # ID: I think our user expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course . # ME: but people don't read manuals . # ID: I didn't read it ? # ID: users to add one ? Do you think ? # ME: I think you should put more time in the in the design of pick up and use , than a manual . # UI: you should You should could take a look at it and know how it how it's supposed to work . # ID: Because they don't use it ? Alright . # PM: Well there sh should always be a menu , but it c can be very short . # ME: And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes . # UI: but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think . # ID: Well maybe for the If you don't recognise a button who d who d who do I call wh when I don't know it ? # UI: It sh it should be there , the manual . # UI: But but not to explain how the remote works . # ME: And we don't have much time . # ME: So it's better to put our attention to the design . So you can pick up and use it , than I think . # PM: Well we are a design team , we can say to some writer make a manual point . # ID: Isn't it part of the of the u # ID: No . No . Never mind . # PM: Well we'll have a look . # ME: Next point . R_S_I_ . # ME: Well that's about twenty per cent I thought . # ME: But the designer should take it should Wie zeg ik dat ? , consider the consequences of using your remote . # ID: Consider the m # ME: It should be a good in your hand . # ME: this is the most important part . # ME: Like the requirements said , we're gonna specify of we're gonna target a younger audience . # ME: , that's about sixty per cent of the market , so it's quite important . # ME: research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their zapping device . # ME: I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of the people like that . # ME: So it's very important we should definitely have that in our designs . # PM: Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost , we can't afford an L_C_D_ # ID: It's going to be expensive . # ME: but they think it's really important . # ME: So if we want to s If we have a big If we make lots of the stuff , maybe we can buy it very cheap , I dunno . # ID: Well we'll consider it . # PM: well it's your task to look into the costs of those # ID: We'll think abo we'll think # ME: I don't have any information on that . So # ID: No , we'll look we'll look into that later . # ME: And another thing is speech recognition . # ME: They also like that , but research is very costly . So # UI: I think that's difficult to realise also . # ME: , but it might be important for the sale . # ID: We have very demanding clients . # PM: It's not yet a standard development those so # UI: and we have customers in multiple countries I think . # ME: Well I do think L_C_D_ is more reachable than the speech recognition . # ME: So we might consider L_C_D_ screens . # ID: Well we'll consider both and see what we can find , I think . # ID: We don't rule them out yet . # ME: , I think that's it . # ME: I think it is sensible to u to take this take these points into the notes . # PM: Well you I c I can still see your presentation . # PM: It's in the Well next I dunno who is next . # ID: Shall I give a technical talk ? # PM: Well go ahead . # ID: Well it is my task to explain or to point out a working design . # ID: We have that here . # ID: Okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the F_ five . # ID: Well , the working design , # ID: Well alright , you know who I am and what I do . # ID: So we have this . # ID: It's a bit unclear because I wanted to copy paste something . # ID: It was originally in black and white # ID: but it became black and purple . # ID: But I think you can read it . # ID: well I think it's important for you to realise the basic function of a remote control . # ID: well you can see # ME: Maybe you can select it . So it inverts . # ID: And I then can select I can select on the dings It goes to the next page . # ME: the p the whole picture . # ME: Nah , never mind . # ID: Well , you can read it , # ID: it's not too difficult . # ID: Meanwhile , this is a schematic view of how a basic remote control works . # ID: You have basically the energy , the power of the of the remote control , and the sender , w which is the LED , the bulb that sends the infrared beam to the , no , to the set . # ID: And the source is of course the user . # ID: the user interface is the buttons of course . # ID: And the user interface sends the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip sends it to the LED , and the LED sends it to the receiver . # ID: That's the that's the basic idea . # ID: well I have put it in a in a couple of basic steps . # ID: the remote is basically just waiting for a user to press a key . # ID: It does nothing until of course the key is pressed . # ID: The key a signal to a chip , the chip senses the connection . and recognise the key . # ID: So well you understand . # ID: The chip produces Morse code , a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . # ID: And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send that signal again to the to the LED , which is the bulb , of course . # ID: Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it's very simple , and signals the signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set , and the T_V_ set also recognises the signal , and performs the assigned task . # PM: So it is also why we have to have a button that says I'm now busy with a D_V_D_ if we had done that . # PM: And a button for T_V_ . So # ID: bu , but we don't . # ID: well this is the basic function of a remote . # ID: I've some couple of pictures here . # ID: It's a very basic one . # ID: And if we if we're going to add an L_C_D_ screen to it , it won't look anything like this , but This is very basic basically the shape of a remote control . # ID: It has very little buttons and But it it's quite , you can easily recognise the buttons . # ID: They're far enough apart and an anything . # ID: It's not very not very high-tech # ID: indeed , and it's not very user-friendly . # ID: if you look at the shape , it's just a simple long box shape . # ID: So we have to change a little bit to that , so that it becomes more user-friendly , and that problems like R_S_I_ and those kinds of thing don't oc don't occur . # ME: Can I say something ? # ME: I have a table here about the l the relevance of the buttons . # ME: the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext . # ME: Well teletext is not an option , so that But I think it's very important to make the power , channel and volume buttons near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ consequences . # ID: because they are the most important buttons and you can immediately # ME: Make them big , make them easy to press . # UI: You can also like # ID: You don't have to look and search for them . # PM: if you have the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same well moves . # UI: , I was thinking you can # PM: But if y if you would put it at a different place , then you have to move your hands , and that's on of the things about R_S_I_ . # UI: Are some of the # ME: That's right . That's right . # ID: Well you can't have any every button under the thumb , of course . # PM: but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R_ R_S_I_ . # ME: That's very important . # UI: Maybe you can make , for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this . # UI: Like some little Gameboy things or some # PM: I've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have those buttons . # ME: But is that is that useable ? # ME: Do people , when they pick up a remote , know that they have to do that ? # ME: It's a f it's a new feature , # ME: you can make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it . # PM: Well also i if someone puts picks up his remote # UI: but if you s say them up and down , they they'll understand it , I think . # PM: If someone puts up i picks up his remote , and he picks up it he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel . # UI: Eighty per cent would . # ME: , he feels it immediately . # PM: That's very irritating , I think . # ME: Right , continue . # ID: But in e in any case the basic function should be indeed , and as you say at the thumb . # ID: I think that's a good idea , and that the less important buttons , like the different channels , the numbers one two three four five as well , should be well not in reach , because they don't use it all the time . # ID: Well it's pretty basically as you said . # ID: And I have some pictures of the inside workings , but I don't want to get too technical , because that's not very useful for you . # PM: That's your part of the job . # ID: So exactly this is how it looks from the inside . # ID: And well that's about it I think . # ID: Oh , I still have this . # ID: Oh I had to delete this , but I had to make a schematic of the of the new # ID: But I had too little time , but don't look at it please . # PM: Well we understand . # ID: I think it's clear how it works . # PM: We understand . # ID: That's the most important thing . # PM: Then Mike can give the third presentation . # PM: How late is did we start his presentation ? # ME: I think w About twenty minutes ago ? # ME: Losing time losing time . # PM: Well then we have still the time , so But we do have to come to a decision , right later on . # UI: Well I thought everybody on the website would see the same thing , but obviously that's not the case . # ME: I don't think so . # ID: there are different We have all have different home pages , with different links . # UI: For instance you couldn't see this . # UI: Well I'm Mike , User Interface Designer . # UI: The the method ? # UI: Well I used my own experience with remotes , took a good l look at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two . # ME: These are already in use ? # UI: these are from another manufacturer . # ME: Alright , okay . # UI: This one is engineering-centred , so this one has the most functions and things . # PM: I like user-centred . # UI: I like user-centr centred also the best . # PM: We also do that . # UI: Well , I thought that we reduce the option to control the D_V_D_ also , and teletext and that kind of stuff . # UI: so I thought we would use more or need more buttons than this one . # ME: But we have to reject that , because of the requirements ? # UI: Th that's why this mm is not relevant any more I feel . # UI: I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we'll need . # UI: I kinda like the shape . # UI: I think this is what we talked about . # ID: You can't really see the differ from different sides . # UI: I've Well I showed it somewhere . # ID: you can draw it if you . # UI: I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front . # UI: So we can customise the # PM: Well absolutely , but i th they all have to have something about the recognition from our company . # PM: So we cannot just make someone w # UI: It's not the whole remote that changes , of course . # PM: but that's th the side they look at is the front . # PM: So if y if you make a front with just a tiger on it , then our recognition is totally gone . # UI: Or you can you can put the same symbol on every remote . # UI: So l like Ericsson does every # ID: We can put it on the on the back side . # ME: We must have that . # UI: S something like this . # UI: It's recognisable . # ME: We can make a symbol of the company right here . # ME: And if you put a front on it , there's a hole on the front . So the symbol's always on # ID: , so that you don't replace the symbol , . # UI: . Something like that , # PM: Or the th the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front . # PM: Those kind of things . # ME: But let's not focus on the front . # UI: Well so uh like I said I thought we'd use more function . If we had to include more functions . # UI: I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need . # UI: Maybe some less . # UI: Like eject we don't need , and some other buttons we don't need . # ID: Mike , can you put that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ? In Map ? # UI: I think for the remote less is more . # UI: The less buttons the better the design . # UI: We should go with that concept I think . # ME: I've got another point . # ME: there are two target audi audiences , and we've chose for the younger one . # ME: , research has shown that it's a high interested in features . # ME: They are high interested in feature . # ME: But they are more critical . # ME: The younger audience . # ME: So we must design a control that really speaks to the people . # PM: Well what if we I at I at home have a remote that has the most familiar buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip , a f a little You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do . # ID: I think the most functions underneath that # ME: Clip aren't used much . # PM: Well but because you say they their features are important , they want m a lot , # UI: but what kind of features ? # UI: Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition . # ID: I think m most # ME: Here , look at these numbers . # ME: The newest features are , like I said , are L_C_D_ and speech control . # ME: Our audience , these people , are very like these features . # ME: So we must build in something , or they will to go to the concurrent . # PM: Competitors . # ID: Our competitor . # ME: The concurrent ? # ME: Competitors , right . # ME: So , I do think we have to have some features . # PM: Well maybe w we could s # ME: Even though they cost a little more . # PM: On some calculators you have lo those little L_C_D_ th that you can click on or something , # PM: or that you can click out of the remote . # PM: And if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information . # ME: Like a ticker-tape . # ME: Which programme you are l watching or something . # PM: Those kind of things , because you also have those program recognition for your V_ V_C_R_s . # PM: And well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you're currently watching . # ID: So it just signals the different sig the different symbols on the screen you have , because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your on your L_C_D_ screen . # PM: It it could be such a little th that you can click in and out and you and you have it . # UI: we should keep that simple too . # ID: But should it really be clickable , # ME: No not clickable . # UI: it should be integrated . # ID: or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy . # ME: just at the top . # ME: So when you s you sit like this you can watch . # ME: I think it should be at the top . # UI: something like on some radios in car . # UI: Where it's , walking to . # ME: right . It's a ticker-tape idea . # PM: R_D_S_s or something . # ID: But that's of course a bit more expensive than the basic calculator design , with the scrolling text and that kind of thing . # PM: Well I think it's you got It just means it's a script that's keeps it rolling , # ME: Well it's just one script . # PM: and it's not That's five minutes off implementing time I think # ME: , five minutes of ja for programming . # ME: So I don't think that's the issue . # ME: Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ? # PM: well I think so , yes . # UI: well we still need to know how much that will cost . # ME: I don't know if I can find that , but # PM: No but we're we'll have to look into that . # UI: Or maybe you will get that information # PM: we can use this board again , I think . # PM: we can put some decisions about the controls we want , th the issue . # PM: Where is my presentation ? # ME: , I understand what you're saying . # ME: We should have a general idea of how it's gonna look . # PM: I mean we're all here now , I think . # PM: These I've already given you . # PM: So we have to decide on the different remote control functions . # PM: So we want to have a small L_C_D_ screen that's special . # ID: Shouldn't we start with the most important parts ? # UI: At the top or at the bottom ? # ID: The L_C_D_ screen alright but we should start with the power button ? # ME: I think the top is more When you s How do you zap ? # ME: You just sit in your chair ? # UI: but with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . # ME: With the remote ? # PM: That thing is terrible . # UI: 'Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom . # ME: but that's where your hand ball might be . # ME: We'll draw two , and then we'll see # ID: Maybe we should centralise the discussion here . # ID: I dunno what you were talking about but we are busy with something . # ME: he thinks He thinks it's better to put the L_C_D_ at the bottom , and I think it's better at the top . # ID: Why do you think it's better at the bottom ? # UI: well because most remotes have some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody . # ID: But you just can put the whole interface a bit down , so that there's room for the for the interface . # UI: Well I d I think that's ugly but # ME: The the ticker The L_C_D_ is like small . # ME: It's not high . But # PM: Well I th I think Mike has a point , # ID: And and we can # PM: because when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . # UI: Power button always # PM: So and I like to use the ones on the top . # UI: , y you gotta zap like this or you want to . # PM: So when I u when I have to have an L_C_D_ s scr window # ME: But We're making a remote with a few functions you know . # ID: Well that's a bit exaggerated . # ID: Well , I agree with you . # ID: It's it's also more recognisable . # ID: It looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the thing on top . # PM: but we don't want that . # UI: you don't want # PM: We don't want them to look like a calculator . # UI: You want it must be a remote . # PM: We want to look it like our original but familiar # ID: but you don't have to throw important aspe important aspect like familiarity completely away , # ID: because I think it's # PM: Maybe a bic better white We White ? # ID: I think it's still important to have it at the top , # PM: format ? Line width ? Width ? # ID: because it's more familiar that way . # ME: Th that's not a problem . # ME: When I draw here it # ID: A little a little bit . # ME: It it needs to be calibrated again . Well # PM: Well let's talk about that later # ID: Maybe you should another pen . # ID: Maybe that's better . # ID: You e you only have one pen for that screen . # PM: It's special pen . # ME: Alright , we have to make a decision now , because we don't have much time . # ME: I think we have a few functions , and we can put the L_C_D_ above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand . # PM: I think it should be at the button , bottom . # PM: Bottom . The L_C_D_ . # UI: At the bottom ? # ID: Well I'm the I I'm the designer , so # UI: In a few minutes # UI: Oh , oh , I totally agree . # ME: We are two V_S_ two . # PM: Well but what if we first decide the different functions , # PM: and then look at the design . # ID: we were busy with that . # PM: Because we have to decide this . # ID: we should summon the different aspects of the thing . # ID: So , we have the power button . # ME: And moreover I think that you two should be come to consensus about the L_C_D_ s . # ME: It's your it's your job . # PM: Well we have a power button . # UI: No it's our job . # UI: For all of us I think . # ID: While you have to agree , I can say it's like this and you must agree . # ME: Alright , let's keep it central . # PM: We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons # UI: The ten numbers ? # ID: Volume control . # PM: the mute button . # ID: Well let's look at your design . # PM: I h love that one . # UI: I think we should use something like this to The the channel up and channel down button ? , in circle , you know ? # PM: Well that's also design . # UI: And and a volume control also in it . # ID: But th on this remote th these controls are for something else , a D_V_D_ player or something . So # PM: They are for some video # UI: as I already said , we could drop some of these buttons . # ME: You should put that power button , channel and volume should have the most importance . # UI: I think these should be in one big circle in the middle . # ME: , but what he said about R_S_I_ was t kinda true . # ME: When when you put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you're doing the same thing all the time , and that's just what R_S_I_'s all about . # ME: So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other . # PM: So people have to move their hand . # PM: And they get less complaints of R_S_I_ . # ID: it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand . # PM: That's what I always do , because all my i important buttons are the same place . # ID: It's good to move from time to time . # UI: but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place . # UI: They they need to be centred . # ID: No but now y W would we have to choose a way in middle ? # ME: Frequency of button use . # ME: channels are most is most used within the hour . You can see . # UI: Volume hardly . # ME: So the channel buttons should be far apart , I think , up and down . # UI: No I don't think . # PM: Up and down far apart from each other ? # ME: thinking about R_S_I_ ? # PM: Well not too much . # ME: Y look at look at the frequency . # ME: Nei not too much , but # UI: The other the other two frustrations are far more important . So # ID: I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you don't have to have volume control and zapping button close together . # PM: Well for example the power button , you can # UI: Well they are used four times an hour , so # PM: If someone is constantly z zapping , it's not going to miss , that it that the power button is not right beside it . # PM: Because I have someone But the buttons is way . # ME: Nei nei n I totally agree . # PM: So that one can be put away . # ME: But just . I agree . # PM: The power button can be uh # UI: Power bu button should be left at the top . # ME: And should and should be red . # PM: five minutes . # PM: well five minutes left . # ME: Right , just make some decisions . # ME: The most important things we have to # PM: how are we going to do it with those numbers ? # ID: C c can you make you make We can use the drawing board now , I think . # ID: it doesn't work well but But it would be pretty nice if we could just draw a simple thing . # PM: Well I have it here . # PM: well that's going to take too much time . # ME: I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now . # ME: Just you decide that , you decide that , # PM: you are Industrial , you are User Interface . # PM: So I think it's going to go to Mike . # PM: But you will have to make consensus with . # UI: Well consensus , We we can put it in the middle , so # PM: Well it's a bit hard , because we are going to be individually . # ME: We're deciding now , so Top or bottom ? # ID: Well I still think it's quite important though to have it at the top , so # ID: You say familiarity isn't important but # PM: Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ? # PM: Plus the d th the design round is still to come huh ? # PM: Alright these functions . # ID: As we agreed , we do have a L_C_D_ . # PM: The number f Well yes , that's alright . # ID: So that's enough . # PM: W the number function . # PM: Are we going to do it like on Mike's screen with one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital ? # PM: How do you want it to do then ? # UI: Well just when you push a one and # ID: There's one two three four five six seven eight nine zero . # PM: It it has to r recognise one as there could still come more . # UI: On most T_V_s if you press two numbers shortly after each other , d it # ID: They'd recognise it . # PM: Alright so no button for that . # ID: Th that's the most That that's very easy . # PM: Okay anyone any oth other functionalities of our remote ? # ID: I think these are the most important functions . # ME: Do you still have the pictures over there ? # ME: , that's about it . # ME: You do need the multi Or did No , like this one . # ME: You do need them ? # PM: we'd just said we didn't # ME: But are we Alright , alright Now okay . # PM: well because we can't integrate it with any other remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are irrelevant . # PM: So just for a television is that all we need ? # ME: it's most useable this way . # ID: basic function . # PM: Teletext is gone . # PM: So all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext Oh screen placing . # PM: We'll have those buttons about And the two important ones we're l f forgetting . # PM: there's screen . You can make it wider and less wide . # PM: And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video . # ME: I do think we have to put that underneath a clip . # PM: But it's just two , and we make a clip ? # ID: just two just two under # PM: Th that's a bit waste . # UI: We we can make a little row of like four buttons down here . # PM: Your L_C_D_ screen is going to go . # ID: But you can put two or three buttons under another section . # UI: alright then . # ID: that's too complicated . # ID: You can just put it somewhere They they aren't used much , not as much as those other , so you can put it somewhere # UI: Oh , they can be small or round like buttons . # ID: s bit smaller and s Well and I think more at the bottom . # ID: What do you think those buttons ? # PM: Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote . # ID: Above or down ? # ID: Well we design it later . # ID: We have it , and we design later where everything goes . # PM: Well any other # ME: Well if you take those th If you # UI: Why go to video ? # PM: Go to video , that's always on your remote control . # ME: , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to # ID: The the video channel ? # UI: That's just zero . # PM: Well l n no not at not at my remote . # ID: No no not always . # ID: Ze zero is a different channel than the video channel . # UI: , but you can zap down # ME: , but when you zap down zero you get to A_V_ . # UI: Yes , I think th # PM: I go to ninety-nine . # UI: No , then you press ninety nine . # ME: well whatever , . # UI: I think go to video is an irrelevant button , but # PM: Th that's the button No . # ID: But it's easy to go If you are at channel fifty five and you want to go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to get below zero . # PM: No you can ch push zero . # ID: It's more easy to get to where the specific video channel button . # PM: I think that one button is I use it # ME: , but if we're choosing to incorporate these buttons , you have to have channel setting , if you wa if you have a new T_V_ . You have to set the channels . # ME: Right all th these different buttons you have to # PM: These buttons , I don't have buttons for channel setting especially on my remote . # ID: well d different screen settings a , sk # PM: It's it's incorporated with p m plus and down , those # UI: well y you must have . # ID: y you have screen width . # UI: you have one button from s set frequency o or something , and then with plus and min minus you can adjust the # ME: That's the only one we put in there . # PM: So we still have one four ? # ME: For a screen fu channel setting . # ID: to oh of course to configure the programme the . # ME: Programme , right . # PM: Oh the Okay button ? # PM: Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu . # ID: You should . I think that's important . # PM: Channel , setting , menu . # ID: And and the settings to change the brightness # ID: the settings to change the brightness and the contrast . # ID: Th the menu button is also important . # PM: I have put it in . # ID: Then you can I don't see it . # ID: Oh Menu , alright . # UI: I think things like contrast and brightness should be in the menu , . # ID: And you can then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something . # ID: Because the zapping buttons aren't used then if you are in the menu . # UI: Or the volume or something like that . # ID: Or the volume , . # PM: We're going to go to our rooms , and we'll have to decide s things on our own I think . So # UI: I thought we'd lunch right now , or not ? # PM: W w we have lunchtime , by the way , now so # ID: this is this is your thing . # ME: Get into my belly . # PM: . We didn't exactly do everything but So # ID: See you later mate .
# PM: door is closed . # PM: Well , let's begin . # PM: Because if we have as much time as the last meeting , we'll have to hurry up . # ME: I'm listening . # PM: well I'll start with the presentation again , the agenda . # PM: This one I think . # PM: Well alright . # PM: well , I'll show you the notes . # PM: It's not as interesting as it should be because we just had the meeting , but I'll show them . # PM: We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design . # PM: Then we'll have to dec decide about the control , the remote control concepts . # PM: I've put a f a file in the project management folder , which says exactly what kind of decisions we should take . # PM: So this time we exactly know what to decide about . # ME: Alright , great . # PM: And then we'll close again . # PM: Well these are some examples , but we'll talk about them later . # PM: We'll first look at your presentations . Alright ? # PM: Walter will start again this time ? # ME: Alright , Trendwatch . # ME: I will speak about latest trends , latest fashion updates , and things we must not do . # ME: It's very important that the control is fancy looking and good feeling . # ME: this because of our last model was very functional , but it people didn't like that , so our new mo model must be very good-looking . # ME: That's something you have to take a look at . # ME: And the feeling has to be very great . # ME: Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great . # ME: there's a minus two times here , because this is the most important point . # ME: This is two times as less important , and same for this one . # ME: , technological innovations , that's regarded very highly too . # ME: such as an L_C_D_ screen , speech acknowledgement , as we talked about earlier . # ME: So we have to have something like that , like we # PM: L_C_D_ and our fronts . # ME: the last point is easy to use . # ME: Well I think that speaks for s for itself . # ME: I don't know who's going to look at that . # PM: Well , easy to use s is a bit contradictionary with the first # ID: I think that's your ta # PM: Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use . # PM: Well we have to choose one of them . # ME: I think we have to go for the first one . # ME: It's the most important one . # ME: So we have to take that one . # ME: So it isn't very important that it works easy . # UI: Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use . # ME: But it has to look great . # PM: We'll we'll look at . # ID: you can make a very complicated uh remote anyway , so ease of use It's not a very comp complicated device . # ME: But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say wow , that's real great concept . # ME: these are the new colours of this year . # ME: So it must be very bright , very colourful . # ME: People like this . # ME: So we have to think in this direction . # ME: So i set your mind to it . # ME: Findings ? Fashion update ? # ME: Fruit and vegetables are cool . # ME: The group we are targeting is very pleased with fruit and vegetables . # ME: So we might cons consider in front of in that sort of way . # ME: furthermore material , that's your part , should be very strong . # ME: I was thinking of something like well iron plate over it , maybe in a colour or something , that looks so f really flashy but it is also strong . # ME: And that's also for the younger public . # PM: Well the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . # PM: Th this year it's fruits but next year it's something totally different . # ME: But I think we can all make the fronts of titanium or something really thin . # ME: So it looks very heavy but you can still use it very easily . # ME: Well , the don'ts . # ME: Older people like dark colours and simple shapes . # ME: Well we don't want older people , we want young people . # ME: So we're gonna turn that around . # ME: We're gonna have real cool shapes and lots of colours . # PM: Wood is popular . Aha . # ME: We don't want wood . # ID: , among the old people , . # ME: So , that's it for me . # PM: Nice , well show us . # ID: Right , I am going to tell you something about the components design . # ID: again I have put up the specification properties . # ID: This so the different components of the of the device . # ID: And the materials ? I have heard several things , so I I'll have to change that on the way . # ID: I suggested in the previous meeting hard plastic . # ID: But as you indicated it should be strong . # ME: , we should change that . # ID: It should feel strong . # ID: So maybe plastic is not sufficient . # PM: Well maybe it is , # ID: We should move to something # PM: but it doesn't look strong . # ID: Y Hard plastic i is of course pretty tough , but it doesn't have a really tough look . So # PM: But we still have to look at our price of course . # PM: Because if we want an L_C_D_ window etcetera # ID: But we'll return to that . # ID: the buttons of course rubber , I think everyone agrees . # ID: And electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic stuff . # ID: The chips made of silicon , I guess . # ID: I think that's the best way to do it . # ID: And infra infrared l LED is just a simple bulb . # ID: Then I've had a few findings , made a few findings . # ID: the target audience product style . # ID: it's generally the case that senior and wealthy people above forty five years old like , as you said , particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that . # ID: They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style . # ID: But of course that's not our things this . # ID: So this is things we must not do . # ID: And then we have young and dynamic people , which is of course our group , the people we aim at . # ID: under forty five years old . # ID: they like soft materials with primary colours . # ID: Soft materials is of course agai again a bit a contradiction with our material choice of what you said , that it should be hard an and strong looking . # ID: But they like soft materials , so we might we have to consider that . # ID: And also they like curved round shapes . # ID: So not too formal like the older people want . # ID: And if also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device . # ID: But since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device , so we don't really have to consider that . # PM: Sports , they're that are accessible on your L_C_D_ window # UI: Soccer fronts . Mm . # PM: All the results ? # ID: Well I also have several examples of styles , # ME: We keep coming back to the fronts . # ID: so you can get a clear picture of what I mean . # ID: these are the basic older peoples' stuff . # ID: It was not very interesting , very classical looking , but that's n that's not what we want . # ID: We have these kind of things . # ID: I don't know what exactly they are . # ME: Fruity . Fruity . # ID: It looks like Well you know you recognise the shapes , it's very primary colours , bright colours and round shapes . # ID: You also see this device , it's not very round and Fruity of course . # PM: It's t terrible . # ID: And well round shapes , primary colours . # ID: You can see it all here . # ID: And of course this famous device . # ID: I think as you know something some devices like this . # ID: So to give you an idea of # ME: Well it's got a strong look , this . # ID: This has a strong look . # ID: Although it's plastic , it's grey to give it iron look . # ME: , it still has a strong look . # PM: And it's round . # ME: But then you are losing your fruity colours . # ID: Well we have to make a # PM: Well you can make th that middle ring can you can make another colour . # PM: So those kind of things you can you can combine . # ID: Well we can't really make a round a round remote control . # ID: I don't think that's very practical , # ID: but But it's important to think about the colour . # ID: Because if we make it grey or silvery looking , it does make it a lot more does make it looking a lot more stronger . # ID: 'Cause if you look at this , it doesn't look very strong , # ID: becau But this is plastic , and this too , but # ME: But it doesn't have to look strong . # ME: The the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy . # UI: And it doesn't have to be strong , also . # PM: You you Maybe you should have some coloured titanium or something . # UI: Only the feel . # PM: So it looks pretty but it feels strong . # ID: And I Then I have some more findings . about the energy source of the of the device , # ID: I suggest the basic battery . # ID: I got some other uh energy sources of course . # ID: But solar energy is not very practical inside a house , because you don't have a have a lot of sun . # ID: And kinetic and dynamos are not very practical , I think , for a simple remote , that's a bit , oh , that's a bit That's a bit much . # ID: And I also suggest as a shape a double curved case . # ID: the disadvantage of that you can use no titanium . # ID: That that's the information I received . # ID: If you use the curved case , a curved case , double curved then you can't use titanium . # PM: What do you exactly mean with double curved ? # ID: Now this to give it a more modern look . # ID: And now the shape , a curved case . # ID: I think sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something . # ID: a more modern look not plain , long box style , but # PM: Double curved ? # PM: It it mean , well okay . # ID: but maybe later . # ID: And it makes it gives it a more u user friendly shape , than if you have . # ID: anyway f as for the buttons , simple push buttons . # ID: No otherwi no difficult scroll things or some things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive . # ID: And , as we agreed , we don't use a speaker or a sensor or speak speech controlled device . # ID: Because it makes it also more complex and expensive . # ID: But we do use an L_C_D_ screen , so we do have to consider of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive . # ID: But It's worth the trouble I think , # UI: The buttons can be made of an a soft material . # UI: Because people like that . # PM: This soft material thing from . # ID: rubber is a soft material , I guess . # ID: So that's basically what I want to talk about . # PM: Alright . Okay . # PM: We will take that . # PM: And then Mike ? # UI: Well nah the method we will include the buttons as we discussed earlier . # UI: an L_C_D_ s screen will be implemented . # UI: we must decide where , this meeting . # UI: there are new developments in speech recognition systems , and they are already being used on coffee machines . # UI: And well they're cheap , so we could use them now . # PM: That's interesting . # UI: it's not really speech recognition , it's more like you can talk to the chip , record the message and record an answer , and then once you talk to the remote , then he will a answer with the prerecorded message that you left . # UI: So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded hi Mike back , then you will get that . # ID: Oh , I understand . # PM: Okay . But you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function . # UI: No it doesn't does not do anything . # UI: But i it's just a # ME: But that makes it cheap . # PM: Yes . I understand . # ME: It's it's just a an extra function , # PM: But it has no functionality for our remote at all . # ME: and it's cheap . # UI: but that's the gadget they want , or the gimmicks . # ID: But it it's n nice for young people . # ME: Young people love them . # UI: Yes , we should really include that one , I think . # ID: They like gadgets . # UI: Well , as I said earlier I think the L_C_D_ screen should be positioned at the lower end of the remote . # UI: the buttons for screen width and general settings and that kind of stuff we can also do let that kind of functions be shown in the L_C_D_ screen , instead of extra buttons . # PM: So you put a menu in the L_C_D_ ? # UI: I think young people and w well every user would like that . # UI: the buttons should be positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , I think . # UI: For the learnability and well to keep it recognisable . # UI: A voice recognition can be implemented . # UI: And I drew an example , but it did not work quite the well the way I wanted it to do . # ID: Can you draw it now of # UI: Well I have the I can draw it again , # ID: Can you draw it now ? # UI: and I know what I did wrong . # UI: I didn't tick the note bo box in the . # ME: How do you uh give input to the menu on the L_C_D_ screen ? # UI: with the up and down and well buttons and the # ME: So you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down . # PM: But then we should also have an Okay button . # UI: Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen . # UI: I shall draw this . If it works . # PM: There is already a blank . Yes ? # ME: You have to push hard . # ID: I suggest a banana shape . # ID: Because of the fruity fashion . # PM: m Next year that's out . # ID: Yellow and alright , . # UI: Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to draw correct . # ID: Those are the cha the channel buttons of course ? # UI: just the numbers . # ID: And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ? # UI: These these will be bigger in the real design . # UI: This must be the Okay button used to interact with the L_C_D_ screen . # UI: And with this you can , yes , go to through the menus and that can the video button should be an apart button , because you want it to t , to use it fast within one click . # PM: And what's the menu button ? # ME: And you need a you need a speaker . # UI: This button can also be the Menu button , we use in the menus # PM: But how did How do you get out of the menu then ? . # UI: Well we can add another button here , but # PM: Maybe I you could j just do an exit with Okay . # ID: by pe pressing the menu button again . # ID: By pressing the menu button again , you go out . # ID: It's usual the d kind of the way it works . # PM: Yes , well but bec because when you push Menu you get in , and then you have to push Okay when you get to a choice . # ID: But you can men you can press menu again to get out . # PM: Well that's also the Okay button . # PM: That's you should have # UI: we should add a extra Menu button # PM: Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s window an option Get Out . # UI: and this the Okay button . # UI: once you have an extra Menu button , you don't need that extra option . # PM: Well , it's just a choice . # UI: You have redundancy . # ME: But we need a we need a recording button for the speech part . # UI: if we decide to implement that , maybe we should . # ID: Why would you put it then , and where is the recording the microphone ? # UI: Well they that could be anywhere . # ID: Where would you put it ? # UI: That's very small . # UI: It could be down here . # UI: Well , not here . # UI: I suggest here . # UI: But that's just a little gap . # ME: and spea speaker at the back , or something . # UI: Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same little hole thingy . # ID: I understand . # ID: but we could d do , but it's perhaps more expensive , the speaker on the back or something . # UI: there are a all already being implemented in coffee machines , so they won't be very expensive . But # UI: This is my suggested design . # PM: Well , okay , alright . # PM: then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make . # UI: And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better at the lower end , or at the bottom . # UI: Oh , I had some examples . # ID: I can live with it . # UI: You can But I did not like it very much , but Well these are quite obvious , very ugly remote . # ID: They do they don't look fruity enough . # ME: Nei They're n they're not trendy . # PM: They're all black . # PM: Hey , that one I like . # UI: this is for children but th # ME: It doesn't look strong . # ID: But it doesn't the # UI: W but with the colours i it's a bit the way we're going to . # UI: Well this is a terrible # ME: This is just crazy . # ID: But it must not look too childish of course huh ? # PM: It's it's all too much buttons . # PM: Too many buttons . # UI: This these are the L_C_D_ screens . # UI: I think we should , if it's possible , one with colours , but # ME: Nah th It's too expensive . # PM: Well , that's too expensive I think . # UI: Too expensive ? # UI: Ha , even more . N # ME: But are we going for a strange form ? # PM: No , not very strange . # ME: 'Cause people like that . # ID: Not not too strange . No . # ME: Not too strange . # PM: It still has t # ME: You can make the underside , you can make it more round , where the L_C_D_ is . # PM: a kind of bridge . # PM: So it f falls over the hand . # ME: I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone , with the round thing at the bottoms , s something like that . # PM: Well I have at home a remote with a bridge . # PM: It's just a half round half circle at And then it falls exactly over the hand , and that's very nice . # PM: That's It feels comfortable . # ME: but people like something new you know . # ID: We have t I will design it , we design it later . # ID: So we'll get to that later I guess . # ME: Alright . Great . # PM: where did I put it ? # PM: conceptual phase , I think this is it . # ID: specific shape . The # PM: I got this from our friends . # PM: So the conceptual design . # PM: These are a few examples which we have to decide about . # PM: All the materials from the case , the electric cable that's all your side of the story . # PM: now from the user interface , your package ? # PM: No well , that's more like the buttons where they have to come . # PM: And B a bit of , well , a bit of design . # UI: , this is what we've just done . Right ? # PM: but we have to decide about these now . # ID: But we should decide now . # PM: And the trend-watching . # ME: Materials are the most , most impor # PM: So as you said , fruity is in , well sells good . # PM: these things . # ID: So we have to put it in one document . # PM: so if we go through them # ID: Copy paste this story into a into a Word document , and then put the answers after the subjects . # UI: Not everything . # ID: Well we have to decide all these things ? # UI: but all these examples are of a coffee machine . # ID: W we can override them ? # ID: Well a case ? that's me . # ID: I suggest Well what do I suggest actually ? # PM: What what kind of properties should it have ? # PM: Well we just listened . # UI: I think we Why don't we use titanium or a hard , some kind of metal for the whole remote except the front . # ME: Do you know the new # UI: Just like most cell phones are . # ID: , I understand . # ID: So we have titanium . # ME: The front is the most important . # ID: but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , to give that strong look . # PM: You know what ? # ID: And then the front is made of plastic . # ID: And you can put that on and off , and switch it . # ME: But the feel of plastic isn't strong . # ID: No but you have titanium of course . # UI: No but you have this # ID: you have the best of both worlds . # ME: alright , alright . 'Kay . # UI: , you have the re remote in your hand like this . # UI: So you feel titanium . # ID: And of course , you have the plastic front end . # ID: But you also have the titanium . # ME: Fronts are cheaper than when they're from plas # ID: of course , but you have to make a decision . # UI: And I don't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to . # ME: , but it it's expensive . # ID: titanium I sh I think # ID: Well , well the # UI: Well any colour # ID: According to my sources , it's totally possible to make an entire uh Titanium is available , and we can make an entire remote out of it , if we want . # UI: then you paint it in the colour you want it . # UI: The plastic is the colour you want it . # ME: we're going for a titanium back and a plastic front ? # PM: Titanium back , plastic front . # ID: I think that's a nice trade-off . # PM: well I am going to put it in here , because we can look . # PM: I solid feel and trendy look . # PM: So material , hard plastic for the front ? # ID: , for the front and then titanium for the back . # ID: For the non-removable part . # ME: But then you have the problem , when you have a titanium back , you can't switch it . # ME: When you want an other colour on the front , it doesn't match . # UI: Well titanium is neutral . # ID: The titan titanium isn't v very , i it doesn't curves . # ME: I understand . # ID: No I nei . Titanium is very No no , but you know b Titanium is very basic colour , and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front . # ID: I dunno if you disagree , # ID: but I think it's doesn't matter very much . # UI: Our customers will use those funky trendy colours , # UI: and they don't use wood . # ME: Funky customers . # ID: And even if it does doesn't match , it will People like mm colours that don't match . # PM: Okay . And well # PM: the electrical cable is just normal . # ID: Cop copper material . # UI: The electrical cable does # PM: It's from our coffee # ID: copper i just a ba basic # UI: No we don't use an electrical cable . # UI: inside , but this is for the coffee machine . # ID: well inside the remote control we use a couple of # UI: but that's not what's meant here , I think . # ID: Well A coffee grind doesn't have Na ja . Never mind the coffee grind . # PM: all the all the inside work of our remote is standard work . # PM: The chip is normal silicon . # PM: the buttons are normal , etcetera . # PM: So that's just easy . # PM: we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our earlier remotes . # PM: The conceptual specification of the user interface ? # PM: well we have our beautiful drawing . # UI: Well I got a better one here # PM: Well you can put that in into the shared folder , # UI: The shared folder . # PM: and then I'll put it in our end report . # UI: I will work this out for the next meeting . # PM: you can Mm . You can put some which button is what . # PM: the trend-watching included these days . # PM: And what do we ? # PM: We thing that fruit and bright colours are # ME: I think we can launch a couple of packages . # ME: You can buy a different kind of machine , but it's the same thing , but with another front . # PM: We can also implement we can also implement fronts from movies that are very hot . # UI: that's the whole idea of the front . # ME: And you can you can # PM: those kind of things . # UI: But that's for later on . # UI: The fronts y you can do anything with them . # ME: but if you if you launch five different packages like iPod mini # UI: For the initiative launch . # ID: For the for the launch , . # ME: It's good marketing . # PM: Launch different lines at once . # ID: So e th then a c couple of basic colours . # ID: not very sim Not # ME: n not too heavy . # ME: You can always take another pick . # PM: We should not give them the m the most lovely front when they buy it for the first time . # ME: They have to buy it later on . # PM: We still have to make those fifty million , ? . # UI: Well you can you can give them s three or so , # ID: The most boring fronts possible . # PM: The most ugly . # UI: so that they can experiment with it and that they want more . # ID: but you can have some basic colours , and then we come with the special patterns on them , # UI: Red red , blue and green you give them or something , # UI: and then you can give them other ones . # PM: well the buttons etcetera , we get from Mike . # PM: this fruit and bright colours , well I think we'll have to in the next half an hour , we'll have to s specify the different types we want to launch , when we well introduce our remote . # ID: we still have to make We have still have to make the es the real basic design . # ID: Because we have the sketch but # ME: But we must remember that fancy look-and-feel is the most important thing . # ME: Else it w won't sell . # PM: Well I'll have to , before I get another warning for five minutes , I'm going to get Where is my mouse ? # PM: where is my mouse ? # ME: Lost my mouse . # ME: Unbelievable . # PM: Well , this we have . # PM: Interface we have . Supplements , L_C_D_ . # PM: Maybe a cheap voice recording . # UI: we should do that . # PM: Individual actions . # ID: We all agree on that . # PM: Industry designer , . User Interface , Mike . You're going to work together on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard . # UI: we can do that . # ID: Together or together . # PM: That's what I got to hear . # UI: But bu we stay we stay here or something ? # PM: well we'll get it to hear that I think . # PM: But I think so . # PM: Th they're saying SMARTboard and that's it # ME: You can take the SMARTboard . # PM: This is the SMARTboard , so # UI: And take it to our rooms # PM: so you can you are going to make a prototype , and y Well that's includes specifying the buttons etcetera . # UI: specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . # PM: So you'll get it on your em on your laptop . # PM: well you will go and do something else on the project # ID: Some non functional tasks . # PM: project evaluation . # PM: , what are you going to do ? # PM: I don't know what product evaluation exactly means , but you'll get the specifications . # ME: We don't have produ product yet , so kind of difficult . # PM: How long do we still have ? # ID: Well , can we talk about something else ? # ID: no I don't know anything , but maybe anyone else # UI: Will we use round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers ? # ID: Round I think . # UI: I also thought . # ID: To make it as round as possible . # UI: And these s these buttons are more triangle-ish shaped # UI: with a square one in the middle . # ME: So you can see you have to up or down . # ID: But now I see the # ME: And this must be volume I think , and this programme . # UI: Well most of the time up and down is programme and left and right are volume , I think . # ID: Well th that depends . # UI: , it depends , but If you turn up the volume , you always see this thingy go up . # ID: Well we We we j we'll just give them an # ID: We'll design it , and then they can give comments on it . # PM: It doesn't work any more . # PM: We can't save them . # PM: So we'll just have them standing there . # ME: You can't click the corners . # PM: It's a bit a pity . # ME: It's a real great thing . # PM: Well we still have more than five minutes . # PM: what are we going to do ? # PM: I as Project Manager ha don't have a clue . # ME: Let's start the design . # PM: Oh we can decide how we implement the feeling from our company into the remote . # ID: Well . I think a logo , our company logo , and the slogan should be or could be # PM: Also the slogan ? On the # ID: If there's enough space , you can put # UI: I I'd say only the logo . # UI: Too much text and it gets too busy . # ID: Well , our slogan is not very long . # ID: It's just a simple # PM: We put the fashion in electronics . # UI: Well it's quite a long phrase . # PM: We put the fashion in electronics . # ME: But we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion with our fronts . So # ID: But you can put it on the back , on the titanium part . # ID: The logo and the and the # UI: the logo should be on the top I think . # PM: Well in the right top corner ? # UI: Right corner , yes . # PM: And well you c On the back , you can put h At the bottom , you can put the logo with the # ID: Right corner , or maybe here in the middle ? # PM: Just just small . # ME: But the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable , when you get off the front . # UI: Well you c Well Yes . # ID: it should be hard on the on the on the board , # ID: and you can remove the front . # UI: The logo can be on every front . # UI: , but then you must really push it in or something . # PM: Carved into the material . # PM: you can carve it into the titanium at the back . # ID: I l I like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing . # ID: But am I the only one , or # UI: , on the backside . # PM: Well , management would like it . # UI: Well n not on the front side , I think . # PM: The front side , no l no slogan . # ID: No not on the front , # UI: On the back Yes , you can , push that in , # ID: but on the backside . # UI: so that it is always be there . # ID: I think it's a nice idea , to make it more recognisable , that the next to the logo you have the slogan . # ID: To make more of an impression . # ME: But not too big . # ID: Not too big . No , very small . # ID: Not on the entire back , but just very small . # ME: You have to make this titanium too . # ID: But readable enough of course . # PM: Yes , slogan from company on the back with logo # ID: But we'll take that with us into the design . # UI: I think over here the logo . # ID: Or maybe here in the middle , but we'll decide later . # PM: and logo also on the front but not exchange ? when changing fronts . # PM: Alright , that's decided . # ID: Do you do you see a bit of the of the of the titanium ? O on the front ? # PM: Five minutes left . # ID: maybe if we make this lower part titanium , # ID: the front is the upper part , and the bit with the with the L_C_D_ screen . So # PM: So a bit of titanium between ? # PM: That's a bit Oh that that's pretty cool . # ID: of between we can do but But then you have two parts of front , two fronts that # UI: No , they have two fronts , # UI: that . You you can # ID: This enti entire bottom ? # ME: Else you get problems with the L_C_D_ . # ME: Like dust in it and so things like that . # ME: When you exchange all the fronts and it's open . # PM: I already have all kinds of filth between the mobile . # UI: No , you can you can just And then not a straight line but some sort of wave or something . # ME: you can make it go round this corner too where the logo is . # ME: Because it has to be there all the time you know . # ID: And then the lower part is titanium ? # UI: This is titanium . # ID: I think that's nice , . # ME: Some some kind of wei weight in it . # ID: I like that bit of titanium also on the # UI: With the with the curved edge . # ID: A bit like a bit like your mobile phone . # ID: Maybe you can show it . # ID: It also has the those two distinct Mm bit like this . # PM: So round where ? # ID: Maybe a nice touch , . # ME: So a little corner of titanium . # ME: We can't take a blank one . # UI: that's nice finishing touch you need . # PM: Yes , that also sounds pretty neat . # ME: So this is the exchangeable part . # ID: I think I'm going to buy it . # UI: , this is the front . # PM: And it's only f twenty five Euros . # ID: That's a bit too much , but # PM: No that's nothing . # ID: No , no , but I think this looks pretty nice actually . # PM: The Phillips remote costs more . # ID: Of course , because it's my design but # ID: No our d our design , alright . # ME: Taking all the credit . # PM: Well you two are going to work together . # PM: You'll get your specifications on your laptop , and then you # UI: We'll stay here I guess ? # ME: But there's a problem . # PM: Well I think we can , I just It's # ME: It's not relaxing . # UI: Well we can erase an animal I guess . # UI: the fourth one . # ME: Nah that's alright , that's alright . # ID: But don't erase my cat . # UI: the fourth one is empty , isn't it ? # ID: I want to preserve it . # ME: This one is empty . # ME: You have to empty one huh ? # PM: Oh , we have a one . # ID: What are you doing chief ? # PM: So , you can draw a . # UI: I think we have to wait ? # PM: Well I'll get a I'll get the message . # ID: until the until the beep goes . # ID: But I don't Do we have to stay here , # ID: or I think we have to return first . # PM: Well you'll Maybe you can keep your laptop here . # PM: Or get your mouse . # PM: Because it's little bit hard to work with these plates . # ID: The high powers from above will have to tell us , . # PM: I always have a mouse next to my laptop . # ME: I don't have a laptop . # ID: We can do a touch-pad on our remote . # ID: No just kidding . # ID: Well we have b you have to have a bit of humour in the in the discussions too , # ME: You just have to push harder . # ID: because it becomes too stressy . # PM: And in your remote control . # PM: So we put a touch pad on it , and say ha . # UI: Aha . This has no function . # PM: We know you'll hate it but # ID: But th youth doesn't care about functio functionality , so # PM: But they do want some gadgets . # PM: So that's wha what we're doing . # ME: It's all about cool things . # ME: And it will sell . # ME: We will be rich . # PM: Our bosses will be rich . # UI: We've done too much in the previous meetings . # UI: we've got nothing to do now . # PM: Well , that's not bad , is it ? # ID: Well they I think that's good . # ID: We all had our talk and we agree I guess on several thing , on most on things . # UI: Its the best remote ever . # PM: Oh he's totally off again . # ID: you have to push harder . # PM: But when I start here , it's here . # UI: Yes , but you get really close to the screen with your hand , and I don't think that's # ME: Recalibrate it . # ID: Where's the good old chalk board with the green board with the , how do you call it , chalk , . # UI: We can better draw a design on this . # ID: Maybe if i if that thing is recalibrated , we can draw a thing quick , and then before it goes off again . # ME: Finish meeting now . # PM: Finish the meeting now . # PM: Alright now we know what to do , so # UI: We'll stay here ? # UI: Or we'll get the email . # ID: Maybe w maybe we maybe w m Can we get email here ? # PM: Well you'll have to work on this one . # UI: Well we'll wait a few seconds # PM: That's a good idea . # UI: and then we'll get an email . # ME: Alright . Have fun lads . # ID: A happy hol happy holidays . # ME: but you can scratch it off or something . # ME: It's better if you have it .
# PM: fourth meeting . # UI: We have to do what ? # PM: Some extra deciding . # ID: W what ? Alri alright . We'll see . # PM: I'll show you the notes again . # PM: Very interesting . # PM: Well you'll you two will present us your prototype . # PM: Then I guess that's your bit ? # PM: I didn't s see anything about it , so I already thought you were to do that . # PM: I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this design . # ID: , that's important too . # PM: And then we'll evaluate , after we have redesigned it . # PM: Because well we'll see about the costs . # PM: we'll evaluate our p our production and then we can close . # PM: Well the finance we'll do later , so firstly I'll show you the notes . # PM: I don't think it's very interesting . # PM: This is copy paste . # ID: From me of course , . # PM: You had some very strange layout . # ID: Well from us all , from all of us . # ID: It's a nice chorus , . # PM: We ge we went through the agenda , and well we had some presentations from you three . # PM: And I summarised what you said to us . # PM: So I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again . # ID: Repeat it . Alright . # PM: This is what we decided . # PM: It's also copy paste from what we made together . # PM: So we still know that . # PM: And then we can we can use the time better . # PM: Well next you two will present the pot prototype for us . # ID: Alright , we both will ? # ID: Or one of us will ? # UI: No you go and I'll supplement you . # ID: If I make mistakes you'll # ID: Right . well this is our design . # ID: it's pretty much like Mike draw drew the in the during the last meeting . # ID: With the different perspectives of it . # ID: we'll begin with the front . # ID: We have of course the round shape the round basic shape . # ID: with the upper part being the front . # ID: Th So there's this part which is made of hard plastic , the front . # ID: And we're using different colours . # ID: Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , and later we'll put out more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything . # ID: But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours . # ID: then we have the lower part of the of the device . # ID: which is of course part of the back actually , because it's also titanium . # ID: You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under the under side of it , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look . # ID: then we have on back on the front the logo in the upper corner , which is made which is also part of the back , part of the titanium part . # UI: , it's a double R_ , but It's a double R_ . # ID: It's a double R_ . the logo # UI: But it's very difficult to draw that in . # ID: it's difficult to draw so small , but it's our double R_ logo is in there . # ID: so that's the logo in the upper lef right corner . # ID: Then we have the buttons . # ID: it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different channel buttons . # ID: So oval , n those are here . # ID: And then we have the m # UI: Channel up and volume ? # ID: the con the , the t volume and the channel controls in the middle here . # ID: with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or square buttons . # ID: And also here are the two buttons we agreed on . # ID: We have the Okay button . # ID: we the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and volume changers . # ID: And then we've here the Menu button and the # UI: Menu for the L_C_D_ screen . # ID: And the video button . # ID: And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen . # ID: this is what we made of it . # ID: You can make suggestions if you want . # PM: Well if I look at it , the side the side view # UI: Well , at the back # ID: Maybe we maybe we should finish first our talk and then you can add suggestions . # ID: Maybe I don't want to I don't want to suppress you but n I'll finish this quick . # ID: okay I've had everything I guess on the front ? # UI: With the logo and our l # ID: We thought about , the back is of course totally titanium . # ID: And we thought about the logo big in the middle . # ID: Just so again the double R_ . # ID: We have then the logo on front and on the back . # ID: Maybe that's too much but you have to say that if you think that way . # UI: No I don't think And the # ID: And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape above the logo . # ID: That's basically what we were thinking about , # UI: And about the side view This the front won't be as thick , but again th the drawing technique makes it very difficult to really # PM: Well I see , but # ID: Oh and before I forget . the voice , of course , # ID: the voice recorder is at the bottom . # ID: And you can record it using , the back of the f w device . # PM: When I look at when I look at this side view , I think w when I have that in my hand , it's terrible . # UI: Well , it won't be visible . # PM: If if you look if this is thick , and this is thin , th then it that it lies over your hands . But # ID: Well it fits it fits the hand , mean the # PM: Well what I what I agree is that when you have such of an arc in the middle , so that the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands . # UI: If you handle a remote , you usually don't have your hand straight like this . # ID: In the middle in the # UI: You you have it a bit . # ME: It depends on the size . # ME: If it's kinda small , this is great . # ME: But if it's larger , then you want to grab it . # PM: And how large is it ? # ME: , that's the question . # ID: That's the question . # ID: H What do you suggest I mean we do ? # ID: This was Mike's prototype , and y you seemed to agreed on it . # PM: Well the sides I haven't seen yet , ? # ID: But now you have a totally different . # UI: Well , they lay there all the time . # ID: well the size doesn't really matter w I mean # PM: They the side view , # ID: W we he drew the s the side , but you d you weren't paying attention as usual . # ID: Well any case , we'll discuss it now . # ID: I think this is a pretty good idea . # ME: , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen . # ME: You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch the screen . # ME: And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it . # ID: But you hold it like this . # UI: you don't you don't grab it , # ID: You're not holding it like this or something . # ID: You , y How do you call it ? . # ID: Well y you don't have it like this . # ID: You have it more like this . # ID: You you you're using buttons this way , or if you're right-handed , this way . # ME: Like you're holding your telephone . # ME: Because if you have a screen on it , you wanna look at your screen . # UI: That way , it falls into your hand . I think . # ID: And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher , # ME: , I agree on this . # ME: No , I don't think so . # ME: That's not the point # ID: Well the Well that's a reason to put the L_C_D_ screen of course on the upper side , but # UI: Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree and only Nils # PM: I think if you t if you three agree then that's it . # UI: But you're the Project Manager , you can make the hard decisions . # ID: If necessary . # PM: Well , we'll we we'll do it like this . # ID: But are d Can you live with it ? # PM: Alright , if you think that that's the way it should # ID: y you said it was totally unusable . # PM: when I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick But In the market # ID: But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess . I think . # PM: No not totally . # ID: Not totally , well # PM: For me , I wouldn't buy it . # PM: Let's say it like that . # ID: but of course y you are also human . # ID: We have to take every everyone into account . So # ME: And you might be You might be target customer . # ID: Well who else thinks like you ? # ID: Maybe a thousand people , # PM: but that's more market research . # ID: or a million people . # PM: So let it be like this at this moment . # ID: So that's that . # ID: any other suggestions ? # PM: I think it's great . # UI: But what about the redesigning ? # PM: Comes to that later . # PM: you . c You can Walter . You can do the evaluation criteria on this ? # ID: You're very personal again . # ME: Alright . Great . # PM: That's more useful than just speaking . # ME: Well , this is just a short intro . # ME: I'm going to do the ev evaluation . # ME: That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria . # ME: So I made a I made a few questions on the hand of uh the impor most important requirements and trends . # ME: And we have to look if our if our device is working correctly . # ME: Well , I put some questions in a Word file . # ME: See if I can find them . # ME: I think you have all seen this kind of evaluation , so I don't have to explain it . # ME: the first question is , is the device good-looking ? # ME: Because normal p most people thought that earlier devices were ugly . # ME: Seventy five percent of them . # ME: So what do we think ? # ID: Well d we designed it , so of course we are very # PM: , we're not quite objective about this . # UI: Well we designed it to be good-looking . # ME: No , I know , but I have to evaluate it . # ME: So I have to take this questionnaire . # PM: To the customers ? # ID: So and we ha we have answer now ? # PM: To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ? # ME: , but I can't can s # PM: Nei . Oh no . I know , I know , I know . # PM: But Well we can go , because of the time , pretty quick through this . # PM: do we find it good-looking ? # PM: Well we think so . # UI: . We designed it to be good-looking , so # ME: , but , you know We dis we di we designed it to be perfect . # ME: So But we have to be critic critical about it . # ME: And I have to take all these points and get a average at the end . # ME: So we know where we stand . # ME: 'Cause th there are some things we might have bi might have forgotten . # PM: Well so it's point four . # PM: Easy to find t # ID: Well l well let's start with the beginning , just one by one . # ME: Right , so is it good-looking ? # ID: Well , I guess I think it's pointed towards the youth of course , if you look at the design and the colours and everything . # ID: That was our target audience of course . # ID: But it's also not completely u unacceptable for older people I guess . # ID: it's not f a device that # ME: The titanium might be f for older people . # ID: , that's for older people , it's more that classical look . So # ME: It you put a black front on it or something . # ID: I think they like black of course , but I think they'll they think the titanium look of it is also I think it's also good for them , so I think we both have consider considered the youth and also a bit older people . # ID: So I think it's very good-looking and not only for youth young people . # UI: I think we shouldn't discuss any points that long , because I don't know how many points there are but # PM: No . I totally agree . # ID: , the fourteen . # PM: We we have to get on , go through this . # ME: Right , a number please . # ID: Is it easy to t change channels ? # ID: well I think so . # ME: So the last one is seven . # ME: Easy to change channels ? # PM: Y Well we have to go through it . # ME: Change channels ? # ID: I think it's as easy as can be made . # ID: You How can you make it any easier ? # UI: With two huge buttons . # ME: The power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ? # ME: The device is easy to find if you lose it ? # PM: We didn't implement anything about that . # ID: D we d we don't we don't have that s # UI: Well it's easier to find than a normal black one or something , # PM: Well six then . # UI: because of the colour . But # ID: Well we don't have the device that beeps when you lost it or so , # PM: Are the functions easy to learn ? # PM: Well w I we do want we have a l f less of an # UI: We have so few functions , # PM: And the device R_S_I_ sensitive ? # UI: Well , I should I think two , because the voice recorder is n not self learning . # PM: , but just do some We we I th I th I think this is too time consuming . # ID: Are we take too much time ? # PM: not towards you , # PM: but towards this all . # PM: Th this is We you have to put it to the customers . # ME: R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ? # ME: R_S_I_ sensitive ? # PM: well a bit , so four . # PM: And features included also one . # PM: those nine is the fancy-looking . # PM: we still think so . # PM: Device fancy feeling . # ID: And I think fancy-feeling too , # ID: because of the titanium back . # PM: Are there enough technology ? # PM: well also we have two . # PM: Is the device easy to use ? # PM: we have not many buttons . # ID: So well maybe two # ID: because of the voice recorder . # ME: Well , with the # PM: Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ? # PM: Well in our covers , in our fronts . # UI: One or two , another two . # ME: f four I think . # ME: If you look at this # ID: Well , it doesn't really resemble any fruit , that's true . # ID: But but we have the sparkly fruity colours of course . # ME: Three , alright . # ID: And you can also have front with fruit on it . # PM: Is the material attractive ? # PM: Well the titanium is strong , and the rest f the buttons feel soft . # PM: So I would say at least two . # UI: This is the last meeting ? # PM: but we have to design much more , # ME: The average will come later . # PM: because there was some irritating account manager coming to me . # ID: I knew things were going too smoothly . # ID: There had to be some kind of trouble along the way . # PM: Yes . Well , look at the costs at this point . # PM: I had to fit it in . # ME: It has to go to twelve , right ? # PM: I twelve and a half . # ME: Twelve and a half . # PM: Well what costs a lot ? # PM: The sample spea costs four . # PM: The sample speaker , the s sensor . # PM: We have to go to twelve and a half . # PM: The speaker costs far , by far the most . # ID: w tha that's a bit an optional option . # ME: That's some wrong info , man . # PM: It it isn't worth it . # PM: We could make two different versions , one with and one without . # ME: It's just extra . # PM: Then we go to fourteen point six . # PM: Well the titanium I don't want to lose actually . # ME: Batteries are quite # PM: hand dynamo ? Y t come on , # PM: w a remote control has a battery . # ID: well we have a bit of a problem I think . # UI: Well well why should we use a advanced chip ? # PM: Well be for the L_C_D_ you had said . # ID: the L_C_D_ screen . # UI: Can't we do that with a regular chip ? # ID: Because that y # PM: Well what what's the difference between simple and regular ? # ID: because my information says it . # PM: What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ? # UI: Regular is normal . # ID: well I read something about it , but # ID: I read something about it , but it wasn't very clear . # ID: I d I didn't in include it in my report . # PM: What happens if we do # ID: Single Well you have to use a chip . So Well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the L_C_D_ screen . # PM: How much do we win ? # UI: We we We have very little options furthermore , for the # ID: But if you have a regular chip , you can't have the L_C_D_ screen . # UI: well we have to put that in . # ME: , we need to have the L_C_D_ screen . # ID: That that's a fact . # PM: Well , we could say , well this special colour , that isn't that isn't there , because the fronts they will buy it . The special colour . # ID: , but it's only one half . # ID: it d it doesn't # ME: No , that's n It's not relevant . # UI: , you must change the chip back . # PM: then you s then you only have one half left . # UI: You must change the chip back , Nils . # ID: But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen . # ME: Then the whole concept is # ID: but that's what my information says . # ID: I di I didn't put the advanced chip in there for fun . # ME: You can make you can make it cheaper . # ID: You have to use it . # ME: But if you don't sell # UI: You you we have an advanced chip-on-print , and we have an L_C_ display . # UI: I think that's a bit double . # UI: Y we don't need both . # PM: the advanced chip is needed to have an L_C_D_ display . # ID: For the L_C_D_ screen . # PM: Says , his that was in the second meeting , I think . # ID: Well and what do they mean with curves again ? # ID: Because we you have uncurved # PM: Well I did single curve to Well you said s double curved , because I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already . # PM: We can also make it flat . # ID: But what did what do n # ID: but What do they mean with the curves ? # ID: Is th Is this a curve ? # PM: Yes , that's curved . # ID: , this is actually two curves , . # PM: No , it's one curve . # ID: It's how you It's how you look at it . # PM: One curve , simple . # ID: Well then we have a huge problem I think . # ID: W t we can never get below the twelve and a half . # PM: We have a big financial problem . # UI: Well we make it more expensive to buy . # PM: Well , then we have two dollars less profit . # PM: Come on , if we if we if we make this fifty million , they won't hesitate to congratulate us , so # ME: If if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more . # ME: But Because we use a brand at the front and I dun at the back . If you have lots of marketing people might buy . # UI: or we could replace it # ME: If you if you make it cool to have # PM: By the way , we also have this one . # ME: Oh , that's just great . # PM: Oh , costs nothing . # ID: Hey but I think you'll agree that we that now we have this screen , it's very not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing . # PM: Plastic is but I just got it . # ID: Well that's pretty l # UI: Why why don't we replace the titanium with plastic coloured titanium , # ME: That is pretty stupid . # ID: N not very practical . Well # UI: titanium-coloured plastic ? # PM: You want to dump the titanium ? # UI: well if we have to get cheaper . # PM: And make all plastic , then we ha then we're there . # ID: But I'm n I don't agree . # UI: But then we we've got to run through the eval evaluation process again . # PM: Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that no-one would buy . # UI: It's not ugly looking . # UI: The looks remain the same . # PM: No , I don't think so . # UI: Well , I do think so . # ID: I think the titanium just provided the tough look and the and the # PM: And the feel , and th that it is strong , and # ID: And also the older people will like it because of that . # ID: And because i # ID: Alright it's not our target audience , but it's useful if it's important for old people . # PM: We still we had to focus to get more people from the younger group , but not lose the one # ID: I think the titanium is very important . # UI: alright but then we won't get there . # ID: we have a problem , . # ID: W But you can better , dump the L_C_D_ screen then . # UI: We can dump the special colour . # UI: We l we use plastic . # UI: And plastic is already in colour I think . # ME: I don't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen . # ID: Well what else ? # ME: Or you shou It's Or change the titanium or dump the L_C_D_ screen . # ME: But I think you could better change titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen . # ME: Because you have lots of functions in it too . # ID: , well . Alright . # ID: I agree with that . # ID: So we u we use Unfortunately . Titanium-coloured plastic . # PM: I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days . # ID: So titanium-coloured plastic for the back . # PM: I I'll talk to the managers . # UI: W Titanium stays there . # PM: Titanium , I thi I think this is this is e really good re remote . But # ID: this is good , but it it's not good enough . # ID: So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid . # PM: those account managers , what do th d what do they know ? # ID: What do we Well what do we know ? # ID: All we want is a is a fancy design but we don't really consider the costs . So # UI: because we did not know anything about it . # PM: One and a half Euros . ? # ME: If you don't have the money , you can't make it . # ID: But we have to deal with it now . So # ME: If you don't have the money , you can't make it . # ME: So this is too expensive . # ME: So we have to make it cheaper . # ID: Titanium gone and add plastic . # UI: , but then we've got money left . # ID: And on plastic times two and then we are there ? # PM: Well , no it's just all plastic . # PM: Well alright . Huh . # ME: It's just free , man . # ID: A lot of plastic , . # ID: No two for the to make it clear . # PM: But then we can add the special colour ? # PM: As we have money over left . # PM: And we still have money left . # PM: What do we want , guys ? # ID: I want gold plating . # ME: I want chrome . # UI: Well I think the case is double curved then . # UI: Because you y have that curve # ID: We have we have to fill # UI: and you have that curve . # ME: Well , th that is the problem . # ID: No no , but th that's not f # UI: Well y we have curves in all directions . # ID: Well you can you can double curve , if you don't have titanium . # ID: And that we dropped , # ID: so it can be done . # ID: But it's pretty funny . # ID: We we do want to reach twelve point five . # ID: But it isn't bad to stay at eleven . # UI: I mean , this ain't titanium , but it looks like it . # ID: We get more salary , if we make if cheaper than twelve and a half . # PM: We have to dump our titanium , and we'll hate the managers for that , but now we're going to evaluate our project , of project , # PM: Well , satisfaction on for example , are we satisfactory about our creativity ? # ID: Well I can't get no satisfaction , but I think it's Well in if we consider the costs then this is the best , . # PM: I think it's terrible that we got those costs at the last moment . # PM: That's really bad . # PM: But that that's that , that's a reason , # ID: Its it's ridiculous actually , but # UI: And unrealistic . # PM: but also for our creativity . # PM: We had nice design , and then you get the cost , and you had to dump all your creativity . # UI: Well we used our creativity , but we just had to adapt it to the costs . # ID: Which isn't very practical , but that's the way . # PM: Well , alright . # UI: Leadership ? Well # ME: Well it's It was very democratic . # PM: well I think so also . # PM: I al I I've filled that in a the questionnaires each time , so Well the managers were terrible . So , with their all their useless requirements . # PM: But o alright , the teamwork ? # ID: Well they didn't think of the requirements . # ID: It's the requirements of the user , I guess . # PM: they said , oh we won't d we won't use teletext , we won't use the D_V_D_ . # ID: but they base that on the user specifications . # PM: Alright , teamwork ? # PM: Well great I think . # PM: well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ? # ID: It was a complete disaster . # ME: , I don't like it . ? # UI: that's a SMARTboard , and that's a digital pen . # PM: It's also a It's both the SMARTboards . # ID: No it's other way around . # ID: That's the SMARTboard . # PM: I liked this SMARTboard , # ID: That's the digital panel . # PM: but I hated that one . # ME: This this isn't a SMARTboard , right ? # PM: Well it's both a SMARTboard . # ID: That's that's the smart # UI: Oh they're both SMARTboards . # ME: This is just a large t large television . # ME: You u you use the # PM: It's both a SMARTboard , but this one is used for a desktop , and that one is used to draw . # ME: , but you ca This is just a beamer function . # ME: And here , on this one , you can draw the pictures and things like that . But # PM: Well , wi w which one did you like ? # ID: . Left or right ? # ME: That one isn't accurate . # ME: It just doesn't work . # UI: But I think this is meant by the digital pen . # PM: Yes . Th that is so . # ID: Well I didn't use # ME: , but I think there's a big distinction between the these th # PM: We're now talking about the SMARTboards . # ME: I don't need a SMARTboard . # UI: Well we used that one , # ID: Nei It it's much m # UI: and we needed it . I think . # ME: but give me a beamer . # ME: That's that's much cheaper . # PM: Or install a laptop to a beamer , or have this one standing here in an I like it . # PM: Okay , alright . # UI: I like that one , but that one is terrible . # ID: But you can I sent it about three times now . # ID: a green board with chalk is much more useful than that thing . # ID: The simple sch school board . # PM: And the digi the digital pen ? # PM: Did did you like that one ? # ID: I didn't use it . # ID: I wrote things down but I didn't import it into my laptop . # PM: I used it just to check it out , but # PM: You you can't send that to anyone , because you you've scrabbled something on a page for yourself , # ME: It isn't practical . Right . # PM: and then you're going to send it , . # ID: W But also y you write things down . # ID: And i you can also bring your note block . # ME: Your notepad . # ID: So what's the what's the th what's the point of importing it into # PM: It's , no , it it's useless . # UI: Well I drew this . # UI: And I made a mistake . # UI: But it would have been useful , if I could show this on the screen . # ID: alright . For drawings , # PM: For drawings , yes . # UI: for drawings . # ID: but not for personal notes . # ID: I think that's not very # ID: I mean you can bring your paperwork along and p Well of course if you have a lot of paper # ME: , it might be useful for drawings . I agree on that . # ID: If you've If you've # PM: But for notes , it i you have to put that in a strict you have to put a name , standard date , and all those things . # PM: And notes for a meeting are very strict . # PM: So if you were to write them down for yourself , and then put that in your computer , you still have to type it over to Word . # PM: So it doesn't d doesn't have any # ID: I understand . # ME: That Stefan use . # ID: But I think d this option is only useful if you've got a lot of paperwork . # ID: You can't It's not very ni well a lot of documents are . # ME: No , I don't think so . # ME: It's it's only useful if you have to draw something . # UI: But then it's really useful , I think . # PM: etcetera ? Well the laptops ? # PM: Of course great . # ID: Can we keep them ? . # ME: Wireless wireless things . # UI: Thanks Project Manager . # PM: Other things we used here ? # PM: I hated the cameras , I hated the microphones . # ME: Well these chairs , man . Really great . # ID: Well did you really Did you really take those in account ? # ID: I half of time I didn't notice they were there . So # PM: I haven't looked w one time directly at the camera . # PM: I don't care about it . # ID: But we shouldn't talk about that . # ID: Because this is a realistic environment . # PM: Well w why not ? # PM: etcetera We N new ideas found ? # PM: What kind of ideas for n a future schedule What ? For future meetings you have got ? # UI: Well I missed the option to email , # ME: Communicate in between . # PM: Chatting and emailing . # UI: Email or chat or something . # ID: But . W well th that's just the environment they set us up f with . So # UI: alright , but that's one n new idea . # PM: Well , new ideas found by this . # ME: Well , more information in the beginning . # PM: We don't want this . # PM: Digital pen is useless . So # PM: , for drawings . # ID: Well , for drawing for drawings . # UI: So it isn't useless . # PM: But two t But th then you have to have a lot of drawings , because if I had a company and I'm going to buy those expensive huge expensive things , I and I have to w pay those papers that are expensive , I'm not going to # ME: For people who sketch th the whole day , I can imagine that it's useful . # PM: Well th then still they should have a nice graphics programme on the laptop . # ID: But it's still an expensive # PM: Because this is huge this v very expensive paper . # UI: Well you can't you can't draw on a laptop like you like you paint of or draw with your hand . # UI: With the mouse it is No . # ME: Mouse is ju just isn't working if you're sketching . # ID: And but what if maybe this board SMARTboard is malfunctioning or someone . # ID: But suppose it was working correctly , what would it be useful then , if it wasn't off all the time ? A # PM: I hated to draw like that . # PM: You you can't draw anything neat . # ME: , but he's saying if it is correct , and you can draw very , very precise # ID: Anything you want . # PM: I if it if it would be perfect following . # PM: Well th then still it's very expensive towards a just a green school board . # ID: Well it isn't , but maybe that thing is , board , a school board , . # UI: but then you can save it in instantly , and re-use it , and # ID: I it has It is useful . # ME: It saves time . # ID: This if it works correct , maybe this thing this thing is just malfunctioning . # ID: So if we get in if we get another one and you make sure it does work , I think then it's pretty useful . # ID: Because you can draw t things quickly and clearly for anyone in the discussion room . # ID: And then you can save it immediately . # PM: Well , they are now . # ME: Celebration . # PM: So , congratulations crew . # ID: Did you type that ? # UI: Celebration . # UI: , we can go to the bar and with our newly earned money . # PM: Finally my beer . # PM: Well , that's it I think . # PM: I don't know how long we still have . # PM: I dunno how long we had for this last meeting . But # ID: Maybe till four o'clock or something ? # PM: it is a bit Well we still have to make the end report and all those things . # PM: I have to do that . # PM: I Di did you save this one in the folder ? # ME: You better get started . # PM: Can you do that ? # ID: we must save this thing , . # ID: In the shared map . # UI: But Nils you've got some work left . # PM: I don't know what you have to do . # ID: Map , is it a good word ? # UI: I have to go to a physiotherapy . # PM: Two times quick . # ID: So it is useful , . # ME: I'm gonna buy one buy one for my bedroom . # ID: Do you believe it yourself ? # PM: He saved them all ten . # PM: Well alright . # UI: Well they wanted everything we produced , so # ID: They also want to see my cat and his rabbit , and # ID: Your big beautiful bird . # PM: Where is this ? # ID: Maybe the pen is just uh broken and the board isn't . # ID: Of or the other way around # ME: Maybe you are broken . # ID: I think so too . # UI: I think you have we have to make clear to her that we are ready . # ME: I think she's listening . # PM: I also think so . # ID: Who is she you're talking about ? # PM: She already knows . # PM: She ? Big brother . # ID: Oh you mean our coach , our f personal coach . # ID: Is she also our accountant ? # ID: Is she responsible for sending that information so late ? Oh . # PM: I don't think so . # UI: Close your laptop . # ID: Because then we have to confront her with our # UI: So she can see we're ready . # ME: I feel watched . # PM: We put the fashion in electronics , # UI: Let's take this remote into production . # PM: but we couldn't because of the costs . # PM: That that's the title of our end document . # ID: That that's our new slogan . # PM: We couldn't put the fashion into the electronics . # ID: Blame our accountants . # PM: , that's a nice title . # ID: But we couldn't , . # ME: Very catching . # ME: I'm sure management would like that . # UI: She's on the move . # PM: I'm going to resign after this project anyway , so # ME: Oh , that's just great .
# PM: The first kick-off meeting . # PM: What shall we do ? # PM: First the opening , then the rest . # PM: What are we going to do . # PM: We m have to make a new remote control . # PM: It has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . # PM: So we will get back th on that . # PM: First we have to make a functional design . # PM: After that we have to make a conceptual design , and then after that a detailed design . # PM: So we'll discuss that later . # PM: First we have a look at . # PM: So first to we have to make a small painting . # PM: What have do we have to do . # PM: First you can save the documents . # PM: We have to do that every time we make something . # PM: You can print it . # PM: And we have to use the pen and the eraser . # PM: We all have to use this one . # PM: You have to make your own favourite animal . # PM: So I'll make an example . # PM: First don't touch that things . # PM: You can use the pen . # PM: And then you can make something . # PM: you can change some things . # PM: format , line , and change it . # PM: And you can change the colour . # PM: So and after it you have to save it . # PM: Now we can make a new one . # PM: You have to paint now . # PM: So you're next . # ME: Well we will try . # ME: Where it going ? # UI: That's strange . # PM: What is going on ? # PM: What are you What ? # ID: What is this , Pictionary . # PM: Is a It is a It is a # PM: Okay next one . # UI: Okay . Let's try this . # ID: Okay . Okay . No problem . # ID: Shit happens . # ME: I'm not getting anything on my screen now . # ID: He did it before . # PM: So you can always go back . # PM: So that was two . # PM: Now next . The budget . # PM: we will sell the t at twenty five Euros . # PM: And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it . # PM: now we have to think about what we will make . # PM: First I wanna hear from you . # PM: what are your experiences with remote controls . # ID: Big one , they are not easy to use . # ID: I have one set and a remote control , when I dropped it , it broke . # ID: So that won't be our goal , I think . # ID: And g big buttons , m that's easier to use than I think . # ID: Not all the small buttons , you don't know # PM: Is this positive or negative , that big buttons ? # ID: Big buttons , positive . # ID: All all small buttons like when you have like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for . # PM: What are your experiences ? # UI: well I think the goal of a remote control is that it's it has an influence on the T_V_ set . # UI: And that it controls the channels and the volume . # UI: And I think it's positive if there's a LED uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote . # UI: So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it . # UI: And that if you push the button the LED gives a light , and you see that it's working . # PM: So and do they always have that ? # UI: But I my experience is that it it's convenient to have that . # PM: It's easy to you . # ME: at home we have a T_V_ , a video recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . # ME: We have four distinctive remote controls for that . # ME: That's not really ea easy . # ID: Help also . Thank you . # ME: So it would be nice if we have one for all . # ME: And we also had a remote control for our radio set . # ME: But i it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what . # ME: And it was uh v not easy to use . # ME: So we n barely used it . # PM: Okay so they have too much . # PM: For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it . # PM: So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? # PM: What what does it have to have ? # ID: The weight . Not not too heavy . # PM: Not too heavy . # ID: Not much buttons . # ID: That when you drop it , it won't break . # ID: Like some kind of rubber on it . # ID: Or hard plastic . # ID: buttons not too small . # ID: something like when you lose your remote control , sometimes it happen . it between the couch and you can't find it . # ID: When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some sort of bleep . # ID: And then you , hey there there's remote control . # UI: well that's that are good ideas . # UI: well the LED on the corner , that indicates that it's working . If you push a button . # UI: And looking on the budget , not too expensive material . # UI: So probably plastic or something . # ME: I think it from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . # ME: Or you won't sell it . # ME: on our website we can see what products we already have . # ME: And it should work with as many as possible of them . # PM: This is It has to be compatible with other things . # ID: I have one more idea . # ID: Just popped up . # ID: it won't take a lot of batteries . # ID: So you don't won't have to change the batteries once a week or once every two weeks . # PM: No battery use . # PM: It's only the first ideas . # PM: what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour . # PM: Next meeting , half an hour . # PM: , what you have to do . Well look on your . # PM: And Next instructions you'll get in your email . So This is the first meeting . # PM: See you later in half an hour . # ID: Okay . Thank you .

Nah , nah , nah . # PM: PowerPoint . Working design . # ID: that's the empty one . # PM: Presentation of working design . # ID: Okay here it is . # ID: A little later but here it is . # ID: It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you . # ID: It's about the working of the remote control . # ID: I just had an half an hour j to study it and I don't get it . # PM: Now have ten minutes to tell it . # ID: Ten minutes to tell it . Okay . # ID: I think it will be a few minutes and First I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control . # ID: The working bout it of it . # ID: then I'll have some kind of map , and it's the top of the remote control . # ID: With a little bit of science , I will show that in a few minutes . # ID: And then what I'll think about it . # ID: First , the findings . # ID: The remote control is a very difficult thing to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control inside . # ID: there's a lot of plastic on it , because its not so expensive . # ID: And there are a lot of wires , which connect the components in it , the battery , and there are switches and things like that . # ID: There's a lot of small electronics . # ID: So it won't be too expensive to build it . # ID: Only twelve Euro fifty I think we will make it . # ID: And here I have the top of the remote control . # ID: here's some kind of chip . # ID: on top of this , there are the numbers . # ID: you have all on your remote control . # ID: And the teletext button . # ID: And here's the battery . # ID: And when you push the button , it will be sent to the chip . # ID: And the chip will send it to all kind of sub-components . # ID: That's what I said , it's very difficult . # ID: And after that it will be sent to the infrared . # ID: And that will send it to your television . # ID: That's a short h how it works . # ID: I think I can make it difficult , but we all we all don't get it . # ID: My preferences ? # ID: It's it won't be We shouldn't make it too big . # ID: also for the cost , we should only put one battery on it . # ID: A long-lasting battery . # ID: also for the cost , use only plastic . # ID: Not other materials . # ID: Also because of the cost , not too much buttons on it . # ID: We can also make a button with a menu button . # ID: And then that you will see it on the T_V_ . # ID: And on the T_V_ you can switch into the menu . # ID: That's I think it's easier . # ID: And the bleep signal , y you told us . # ID: but we can also use it a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep . # ID: Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something . # ID: And also the bleep , when what I told you about when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you hear bleep , and we will find it . # PM: Two questions . # PM: You say one battery is cheaper . # ID: If we w if we use only just one small pen-light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two . # PM: when you use two , you can use it two times longer . # ID: then we'll have to make the remote control long lasting . # PM: Okay so it's the size of the remote control . # PM: Okay and the buttons . # PM: When you use it on the television , you've you need the television , wh which can use it . # ID: But I think this our remote control is for the televisions we sell in our company ? # ID: Or is it also for other company for other televisions ? # PM: I think we have to use it also on other televisions though . # ID: Then this is an option . # ID: Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions . # ID: And then we make it easier for our televisions . # ID: And on the other tele televisions , you can also use it , but then we won't use the # PM: but I don't I think it They are two different things though . # PM: We have to choose one . # PM: It has to work on o all televisions . # ID: Then I think the menu button will only work on the newer televisions . # ID: And we will look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions . # ID: And I just have one more idea . # ID: maybe it's one of your tasks . # ID: But , to have a trendy remote control , we can also make something like the Nokia mobile phones . To change covers . # ID: So if you have a trendy half with all red , yellow and something . And then you can put a red cover on it . # ID: And also different things . # ME: Will this will this add to the cost ? # ID: then it won't be will have just one cover on the original one . # ID: And then you can buy the covers . # ME: but you have to m be able to change it . # ME: D does it make it more difficult to design ? # ID: I think it will be a little more difficult , but not too much . # ID: Just like with the Nokia mobile phones . # PM: but there are much more Nokia telephones than these ones . # ID: but then we'll have to just put five covers on it , and see if it works . # ID: If it won't works then we'll get something else . # ID: Then we won't g go further with it . # PM: but are their profits bigger than their cost ? # ID: a p a cover made in China , it won't be I guess so expensive I think . # PM: but there are also design cost . # PM: I don't think When you have a remote control , do you change the cover ? # PM: Would you change the cover ? # ID: But maybe I think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it , and the children think , oh this is my remote control , I made a picture on it . # PM: I think that too less people would change it for good profit . So # ID: And the other people ? What do you think about it ? # UI: it's a good idea . But If if it , I don't I'm not sure if it will make profit enough to But it's original idea . # PM: Yes it is but I don't think we have to do it . # ID: You're the Project Manager . # PM: Okay thank you . # PM: So now the User Interface Designer . # UI: Yes well uh I shall give a short talk about the technical function design . # UI: I thought the technical function design was to for a remote control to have some influence on the T_V_ set . # UI: both audio and vide video in a cordless way . # UI: No cords attached . # UI: And well , it all by pushing a button on the remote . # UI: That was from my own experience and the previous meeting . # UI: I find some interesting quotes on the web . # UI: well the same idea here . # UI: message to the television . # UI: And and well basic operations like on and off , and switching channels , and maybe teletext or something like that . # UI: well these are two remotes , and that's our dilemma I think . # UI: We just heard from the Industrial Designer how difficult it is . # UI: But shall we make a basic remote control , just swapping channels and volume and power button and well nothing much more . # UI: Or uh more functions on the remote . # UI: maybe more devices you can influence . # UI: a radio or a v a video recorder , V_C_R_ . # UI: well that's our dilemma . # UI: any ideas about that ? # UI: Basic or multifunctional ? # PM: We'll got back on that later . # UI: well the that was just on my mind . # UI: So I didn't know what way we would go . # UI: Mm well that was my functional talk . # PM: 'Kay , thank you . # PM: Then it's your turn , the marketing expert . # ME: This bit too far . # ME: So I'm gonna have a presentation about the market , about what people think . # ME: we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . # ME: And we looked at several things . # ME: among them design , d how d did they like the use of it , what frustrations they had while using remote controls . # ME: well what will be our market . # ME: And we asked them if we had some new featu features . If that would be a good idea or not . # ME: Well our findings . # ME: our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls . # ME: they especially found them very ugly . # ME: And th they also found them hard to learn how to use it . # ME: well they also zap a lot . # ME: So zapping should be very easy . # ME: And fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . # ME: So a lot of unused buttons . # ME: There is more findings . # ME: on the buttons . # ME: Which buttons find users very important and which not ? # ME: And how much would they use them ? # ME: Well the most used button is the channel selection . # ME: And we asked them how relevant they think the buttons are . # ME: The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . # ME: teletext is less relevant but also important . # ME: not important they found the audio , that's not the volume but specific the pitch , or the left or right . # ME: the screen and the brightness . And channel settings . th and they also are not used very often . # ME: Then we have a few graphs about the market . # ME: here we can see what the market share is of several groups . # ME: as you can see , most users are between thirty six and forty five . # ME: the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . # ME: And to come back on the swapping things , I don't think , I think the younger will be most interest in it . # ME: But they are not a very big group . # ME: in the we asked them , how would you like a s a new feature . # ME: If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control , what would you think of it . # ME: Now you can clearly see young users say . I will that would very nice . # ME: And older user think they will be scared of change I think . # ME: And they won't like it . # ME: And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it . # ME: Well here we see the same . # ME: Young users think that's an interesting idea . # ME: And old users not . # ME: well we found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim . # ME: the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five . # ME: they are highly interested in the features , as you can see here . # ME: And they are more critical on their money spending . # ME: the second group is the older group . # ME: Aged between forty six and sixty five . # ME: They are less interested in new features . # ME: But they spend their money more easily . # ME: Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about sixty percent . # ME: And the second group about forty percent . # ME: So the first group is bigger . # ME: Well then I come to my personal preferences . # ME: the first question is also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at . # ME: of course n saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it . # ME: But less of them will buy it . # ME: What I thought , even young people say it's hard to use , remote control . # ME: So if you make a remote control that is very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even the young group will also be more interested . # ME: And we can make special features . # ME: But I think it looks nice in the first time . # ME: But when use it , I don't know what's good thing of speech recognition . # ME: well th that's my second point . # ME: less important functions should be discarded from the remote control . # ME: It's about discussion we had earlier . # ME: You can find most functions on a T_V_ set . # ME: So you don't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness . And such things . # ME: well the design is very important . # ME: One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would buy a good looking remote control if there will be one . # ME: But they found most remote controls very ugly . # ME: So the design of our remote control is very important . # ME: And it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that . # ME: That were my findings . # PM: Okay thank you . # ID: I have one question . # ID: If we aim for the younger people , and there will be a lot of features like L_C_D_ or the speech f recognising , the cost will be a lot of h a lot higher . # ID: I think we don't have that in our budget . # UI: And I don't I don't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something . # UI: So it's , it's hard to get the younger group . # PM: I think the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition . # PM: So I think that can be an d good option . L_C_D_ . # PM: Yes . Only the L_C_D_ . # PM: But we'll come back on that . # PM: What d we go back on the decisions later . # PM: Now we have a few new product requirements . # PM: First , teletext . # PM: We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore . # PM: So not necessary . # PM: Only for the television . # PM: So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something . # PM: Only the television . # PM: We look at the age group of forty plus . # PM: no , younger than forty . # PM: Is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff . # PM: Fourth point . # PM: Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . # PM: Very important for the design . # PM: So you can see it on our site . # PM: We have to make our decisions , what we want to do . # PM: So like you said , we need the . # PM: Maybe it's good to put it in a document . # PM: Now we have to decide what controls do we need . # PM: So maybe you can tell us . # ME: maybe we can first have a discussion on the product requirements you just said . # ME: The the requirements you just said , maybe we should first have a discussion about that . # ME: I personally think teletext is a good option . # ME: not everyone who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news . # PM: but we don't use it . # PM: It's a new requirement . # PM: So , it's not my requirement . # ID: 'Kay , we'll just have to do that . # PM: We have to do this . # ID: No discussion about it . # ME: Okay . Okay sorry . # ID: Unfortunately . # PM: what controls do we need ? # UI: Well a power button ? # UI: the well I think separate channels . So # UI: But then both the separate channels . # UI: So so zero to nine or something . # PM: Channel Zero to nine . # PM: Maybe it's easy to pick . # PM: What was w your one ? # ME: It's the functional requirements . # PM: Where was that example of the # PM: technical What do we need ? # ID: To change to the next channel , just one button . # ID: To move up , move down . # PM: that's the channel . # ME: Do we make a menu ? # PM: the n newer televisions ha do have menus . # PM: I think the only one or two numbers . # ME: I think it will be q quite easy to use , to have uh four arrows . # ME: Up-down for channel selection , and left-right for volume . # ME: And a menu button . # ME: And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . # ME: But the then to scroll through the menu and to change the options . # PM: On the L_C_D_ screen , you mean ? # ME: well that depends on if you have the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control . # PM: Think it's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it has to work on all televisions . # ID: But then we come to the costs . # PM: But if we have this # ME: But well if you aim at the younger market , a as they as s as we seen in the usability lab , they will buy a nice looking remote control . # ME: And also to find the easy to use part very important . # ME: So if we have a L_C_D_ sh screen , and not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell . # PM: So now we don't have a lot of buttons . # PM: Is this enough ? # PM: Maybe in the menu ? # UI: but then it's always more than one thing to do . # PM: Well . Then that's all . # PM: This will be the buttons . # PM: I think that's enough for the next phase . # PM: So we can go on to # ID: But now we have only the buttons . # ID: And we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? Or # PM: that's for the next phase . # PM: Phase two is the conceptual design . # PM: So then we'll have the concepts . # PM: That's for the So next point . # PM: Now we have lunch-break . # PM: After that we have t thirty minutes for work . # PM: And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the buttons . # PM: Your individual action , you can find them in the email . # PM: So now it's time for lunch . # ME: Okay . Good idea . # PM: Thanks for coming .
# PM: Well , let's start . # PM: What are we doing ? # PM: Okay . Okay . Not doing . # ME: Now I have my screen back too . # PM: we have presentations . # PM: So first , it's your turn . # UI: Mine . Oh , great . # PM: Isn't it amazing . # ME: Very interesting . # PM: Industrial Designer . # PM: Interface concept . # UI: Yes , well let's talk about the interface concept . # UI: , first I'll discuss the buttons we just chose , show you some samples , discuss some colours and design maybe , already . # UI: And my personal preferences . # UI: Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . # UI: the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . # UI: The channels buttons , one to nine , and off uh zero to nine , and the button to choose higher channels than nine . # UI: the volume and channel quadrants , left and right , up and down arrows , to do the volume and channel . # UI: And the menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ display . # UI: , I found some interesting uh samples . Examples . # UI: , well what's pretty standard is that it's that they're all pretty uh high Large and pretty thin and long . # ME: A lot a lot of buttons . # UI: , power buttons are mostly at the top left or right . # UI: , well we see the same arrows . # UI: , well arrow b buttons can be blue . # UI: And what's interesting is the icons on the buttons . # UI: Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we don't use that . # UI: But , these we have to choose the right icons , or letters . # UI: this is the V_ for volume , but they're both a V_ . # UI: So it's not really very clear what's the function of that . # PM: Can you go back one page ? # PM: For the menu , what do we use for that ? # PM: We don't have buttons for the menu . # PM: Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel . # UI: I thought that was our idea . # PM: You have to put it on the # UI: And that the menu button is okay . # PM: but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows . # UI: The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean . # PM: Yes . The second one . # UI: , well that's something to think about . # ID: , maybe I'll have something in my presentation . # ID: And you will see it . # UI: , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next meeting . # UI: But , as we have to design the case and the whole remote control in our corporate company uh colours and the logo , I would recommend a yellow case . # UI: The logo at the bottom . # UI: And , well maybe each set of buttons has his own colour . # UI: , recognisable . # PM: Not too much colours . # UI: , no . Not too much . # PM: No , it's not flower power . # UI: But this has to be has to be trendy and , so good icons on the buttons , and big buttons is my personal opinion . # UI: That was that . # PM: So , you're next . # ID: , at first we will I will f say something about what younger people want , our group w we want to sell our remote controls to . # ID: And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also . # ID: First , the younger people , they want like soft mat materials and primary colours . # ID: Like , totally yellow , totally red . # ID: , so it's visible . # ID: , the shapes are curved and round , like you also said . # ID: Maybe it's nice to get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and flat and long . # ID: But to give him the shape of your hand , so you it's easier to use or something like that . # ID: But that's just an idea . # ID: And then , I'll have to discuss about the costs of all the things for the remote control . # ID: The battery , there are few options . # ID: , I think the best option is to use the basic battery . # ID: So , everybody can buy it at the at the supermarket . # ID: Or use a k kinetic battery like within a watch . # ID: When you shake it a few times , it it's loaded . # ID: , the form of the remote control , I think it's also nice have it curved . # ID: And maybe like it's hand-shaped . # ID: , so you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons . # ID: material , you use plastic . Hard plastic because it won't have to burst like in the in one time . # ID: And also rubber because the younger people like that , what we see in the research . # ID: the push-buttons . # ID: We have one new thing discovered . # ID: It's a scroll push thing like a mouse . # ID: Maybe it's easy to use for the channels . # ID: When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , if you wanna see that channel . # ID: And also for the mouse , for the volume , it's also easy to use . # ID: Just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down . # ID: And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here . # ID: You can do it with your thumb . # ID: And with your l left hand you can push the buttons if you push channel one , you can see channel one . # ID: The electrics with a scroll push button , we must use regular chips . # ID: There are also simple chips . # ID: They are cheaper . # ID: , but then we have just a basic uh remote control , and I think there are a lot of those things , and people won't buy it any more . # ID: They have seen enough of it . # ID: And you have also advanced chips . # ID: But that's with the L_C_D_ screen . # ID: And the costs will increase a lot more . # ID: And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ , and the chip who is more expensive . # ID: And maybe it's also then thoughtful if we u use as different kind of shapes for the for remote control , that we then use the primary colours . # ID: Like , you get a yellow remote control , red one , blue one , et cetera . # ID: You have any more questions about this ? # ID: I think the main thing is we look at the costs . # ID: And not too basic , not a basic remote control , who everybody already has . # ME: But , thi i This is with an L_C_D_ ? No , # ID: Not with an L_C_D_ . # PM: But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll buttons . # PM: Then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push . # ID: But then , what I say , the costs will get a lot higher . # PM: But then it's not easy to use scroll wheel . # ID: Th then you'll see it on the television . # PM: , yes . But then . , then you go one down one up . # PM: When you scroll . # ID: but l when you see a menu on the television , it's like you see one to twenty , you go uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty . # PM: but like we said before , it has to be used on every television . # PM: So you may not be The television must do that . # ID: , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which can provide our remote control . # PM: but young people have to have all their room . # PM: And mostly they are smaller . # ID: But that won't be a problem . I think . # PM: Most the times that are not advanced televisions . # ID: but then we'll get to the regular remote controls . # ID: And I think , what I said , everybody has them has them already . # ID: And they go to a supermarket and buy them for two Euros . # ID: , and ge and get the most cheapest thing . # ID: And I think we must look further to devel d develop something news . # ME: , can you give an indication in b in the cost difference between the chip with L_C_D_ or without ? # ID: I got it on my screen and it was higher . # ID: But I don't know how much higher . # PM: That's important . # ME: I think if we have an L_C_D_ , it will also sell a lot better . # ME: And that might bring back the costs # ID: But then we'll I think we must discuss who what will be better . If we have a better shape of the remote control , or better options on it . # ID: With a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a L_C_D_ . And then a flat remote control . # ID: Or , a more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without L_C_D_ . # PM: Maybe you can look how much it is for the L_C_D_ . # ID: I can look on my # PM: It's very important . # ID: Note that the push-button requires a simple chip . # ID: A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range . # ID: The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip . # PM: , more expensive . # ID: That's from my manufacturing division . # PM: Well , thank you . # ME: So , my presentation is about trend-watching . # ME: , I did some trend-watching . # ME: It's very important to keep up with latest trends . 'Cause if you don't , you won't sell . # ME: So , well how we did do that ? # ME: , well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers . # ME: They watch in cities like Paris and Milan . # ME: Of course , well known for their trend trends . # ME: And well , what did you find ? # ME: , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich . # ME: Well th and the young and trendy , they starting to like fruit and vegetables as a theme for n clothes , shoes , and also products . # ME: And , material ? That should feel have a spongy feeling . # ME: And to get a feeling for what it is , here is an image of it . # ME: Then the old and rich . # ME: They like dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes . # ME: And , they also like familiar material , especially wood . # ME: Now , another picture . # ME: To get a feeling for this . # ME: Well , then already come to my personal preferences . # ME: We aim at the younger market . # ME: So , we should also be look at their trends . # ME: However , with trends it's always if there's it's now . # ME: It it might last one year , and next year it be can be totally different . # ME: And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year . # ME: So , we m must not just only look at what the trend is now , as it might be totally different next year . # ME: So , that's one thing to keep in mind . # ID: Changing covers . # ME: Any questions ? # PM: So now , it's , let's see . # PM: Now , w we have to decide Well , we have to decide on the concept . # PM: So , we have to look at 'S next . Components and user interface concept . # PM: Now , we have to make some concept . # PM: Maybe one of you can paint it on the board . # PM: First , user interface . # ID: How w how we how we make it ? # PM: Yes , a concept on # ID: Shouldn't we first discuss about like what w we all # PM: but maybe we can paint it . , what do we want ? # ID: , but if I paint with # PM: I'll paint . Okay . # PM: Something like this ? Or Shapes or What do we need ? # ME: Can make several concepts . # ME: We have this , and we had the idea of an a more uh like sh in the shape of your hand . # ID: More like something # ID: I can't dr I can't draw it . # PM: And you have to . # ID: I'm not a designer . # ID: It's more three D_ . # ID: Like , when you have a part here . # ID: This is the remote control . # ID: And then you have something like th this under it . # ID: So , it's easier to get it like this . # ID: It's like a gun . # PM: So , it has to be soft ? # ID: And it has to be soft , . # PM: And , the buttons ? # ID: So , you can squeeze in it and # ID: Buttons on top of it . # ID: The scrolling . You can do it with your thumb . # UI: But but i that's the only scroll button on it then ? # ID: But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . # ID: One till uh zero till nine . # PM: But , well there one for the sound and one for the channels . # ID: And the b Or two buttons . # PM: , two scroll wheels . # ME: And i if we go to # ID: 'Kay c If we do If we use one , then we'll have just a switch on it , and you'll just switch it , and now it's the sound to switch back # PM: That's th that's more difficult . # ME: But if we have a me . # PM: It's better in # ME: If we have a menu , how do we choose other options ? # ID: with the menu button . # ID: And then you also can scroll in it . # ID: Just not like all the other ones , with this thing , and here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow . # ID: Because , from h hundred remote controls , ninety nine have it . # PM: But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu . # ID: , then we have it on the T_V_ , the menu . # PM: , but again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ? # PM: You don't know . # PM: So , there's no menu . # ID: It's like some sort of teletext option , but we don't have teletext . # PM: So you can't use it . # ID: And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it , then the costs will be much higher . # PM: we make two concepts . # PM: One with L_C_D_ . One without L_C_D_ . # ID: But you all like this kind of thing . # PM: Good concept . # ID: With the scroll button . # ID: And and this one has to be soft . # ID: And this has to be harder , because when it falls , it mu must not burst . # ID: Or some kind of rubber around it . # PM: Two . Number two . # UI: And you can and you can make the power button as a trigger . # ID: Here . Trigger . # PM: But when you handle it , you put it on and off . # PM: It's not good to use . # PM: No , it's not good . # PM: Now , second concept . # PM: One with L_C_D_ , one without L_C_D_ . # ID: With the scroll thing on , like this ? # PM: One with two scroll buttons and one with without . # PM: , one with a with a menu , and one without a menu . # PM: And the one with a menu has an L_C_D_ . # PM: Unbelievable . # PM: Do I have to do everything . # PM: You have Not so difficult . # UI: But if you put push the menu button # PM: , that's the menu . # PM: There for the L_C_D_ screen . # UI: , wh what Yes , but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose . # PM: You have to For the menu . # PM: And one that way . # PM: Then it depends on the cost . # ID: But is it easy to use ? # ID: When you have it on your left side , # PM: When it's not too big . # PM: Just like a phone . # ME: M , maybe it's better if the scroll-wheels are # ID: Separate , more separate , h . # ME: more separate , . # ME: Like , you have the menu button in between # ID: On the left a scroll button , and on the right a scroll button . # ID: But would it be easy to use then ? # ID: If it's like you have a big # PM: When you the menu , you have to go there . # ID: I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for . # ID: They were like round curves , different # PM: , okay . That's that's the outside . # ID: Okay , okay , okay . # PM: First the buttons . # ME: Think we have we have now two buttons missing . # ME: The mute button . # ME: We have two buttons missing . # ME: The mute button . # ME: And , the to have to numbers # PM: Mute . And the other . # PM: Not so difficult . # ID: Personally , I think two scroll buttons aren't easy to handle . # PM: But how do you wanna solve it ? # ID: With the switch button . # PM: but on the menu that's not easy . # PM: Then you go down , you switch , you go into the right , you switch , you go down . # ID: Oh , you mean like that . # ID: , then you can also have like th # ID: , and joystick , I think . # PM: But is it Does that break , a joystick ? # PM: Or a small one just like in a laptop . # ID: like in a laptop , s some sort of thing . # ID: A little bit bigger , with easier thi # PM: Mean , it's better . # PM: But how expensive it is ? # PM: Oh . Why do I pay you for ? # PM: Better ideas . # ID: Or no scroll things . # ID: No , no . It won't work . # PM: For the young peoples I think scroll button's good . # PM: Think we have to keep them . # ID: Or a remote control more like joystick . # PM: , but is it That's not expensive than Joystick is better . # ID: A small one like this , like a Nintendo k # PM: just like in a # ID: Playstation thing . # PM: Then it's not so big . # ID: I mean the shape of the remote control . # PM: Oh the sh but then you can # ID: Just like a Playstation thing . # PM: Maybe , if it's possible , it's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better . # PM: So , please look at it . # ID: No , that's okay , # ME: And on the L_C_D_ , how much it costs ? # ME: , it costs extra ? # ID: they're not in details . # ID: It's more expensive or less expensive , huh ? # PM: we I think you get it . # PM: So , after this meeting you have half an hour to fix it . # ID: Then I have to come with it . # ID: I got my personal costs . # ID: I don't I don't know the costs . # PM: Your problem . Not mine . # ID: Then I'll make something up . # PM: So , do we have other concepts ? # PM: Then for the components , we use a normal battery . # PM: Then it's Ch cheapest way , I think . # ID: , or the or the kinetic with normal battery . # PM: No , no kinetic . # PM: Kinetic is ch makes it more expensive . # ID: , I think it's , more expensive . # PM: So we use a normal battery . # PM: Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ . # ID: Depends on the scroll . # ID: If we use a scroll , then we have the regular chip . # ID: If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip . # PM: And , we If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to # ID: the most expensive . # PM: So , depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll . # ID: No okay scroll-wheel . # ID: So , I have this . # ID: So , it will be the advanced chip , or the regu or the regular chip . # PM: So , the shapes of the design depends on the L_C_D_ But , it has to be small . # ID: Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? # ID: And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ? # PM: If you have pistol , it L_C_D_'s not easy . # ID: Just use your thumb . # PM: If you use a phone . # ID: I use my thumb . # PM: k , but then you have it . # PM: Like , th if you have pistol , you have it so . # PM: And the screen is Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen . # ID: If you have a joystick on if you have like an uh a ni a Playstation game controller . # ID: And you move up , f forward , down , left . # ID: Then you have just , a little bit curved . # ID: It's not just straight . # ID: That's how we use it . # ID: That's why they make joysticks like that , I think . # PM: , but then you look forward . # PM: And then you can y N well , if you have to look at it . # ID: 'Kay . Here's our designer . # ME: If we have then something standing here , with the L_C_D_ . # PM: Then it goes like this . # ID: It's for the younger people . # PM: Yes , of course . # ID: It's something new . # PM: But the , it may not break . # ID: Now we put rubber around it . # PM: Okay . If that's possible . # ID: Hard plastic , the shape , and around it hard around it rubber . # ID: And the hand shape is also rubber . # UI: Or you can turn it inside . # ME: I can't see the . # ME: But , the easy of # ME: , th the ease of use wasn't the most important aspect of it . # UI: No , that's true . # ME: , for us it's about to sell it . # ID: This is something new . # PM: Then this is the design . # PM: And the buttons are on the next page . # PM: So , depends on the cost . # ID: Costs are okay . # PM: we have one minute . # ME: You have more . # ME: You have still ten . # PM: Next meeting . Thirty minutes . # ID: Oh , that's us together . # PM: You two stay here . # PM: Now you have to . # PM: I think it's clear . # PM: Check your mail . # PM: It has to be ready in the next meeting . # PM: Next meeting is called the detailed design . # PM: Everyth everything has to be ready . # PM: Thanks for your attention . # ME: See you at the next meeting .
# PM: So , now , last time . # PM: Can you push the button ? # PM: One time please . # PM: I'm still the secretary . # PM: Now , I ask you to presentate the prototype . # PM: One of your you two . # UI: Oh this , you mean ? # PM: Yes . The prototype . # UI: Yes , well this is it . # PM: Well , thank you . # UI: It's it's yellow . # UI: And , this is rubber . # UI: And and this too . # UI: And the rest is hard plastic . # UI: We we had some We had a new idea that this can be uh turned inside . # UI: And then it covers the these buttons until here or something . # UI: And then you can still use the power button and the mute and the joystick . # UI: So , you can still operate all the things . # UI: Because you don't always use the menu . # UI: And then it can break . # PM: And the buttons ? # UI: And everything is blue , except the power button . # UI: , and the mute and the other button . # UI: Channel higher channel button . # PM: And the joystick is for the volume and the channels . # UI: , yes . Yes , Very obvious . # ID: Up is channel up . # ID: Down is channel down . # ID: To the right is volume up . # ID: To the left is volume down . # PM: Okay , so if joystick and L_C_D_ . # UI: R_R_'s the l the company logo . # PM: Okay . Very good . # ME: That's on the rub rubber part . # UI: That's about here . # PM: So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . # PM: So , that's it . That's prototype . # PM: Now , the finance . # PM: We don't know if it's th it if it's okay . # PM: So , I'm gonna look . # ME: Do we change the Do we change the order ? # ME: Or are we going to ev evaluate it first ? # PM: Finance is Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet . # ME: That can be none . # ME: , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . # ME: But I have a introduction how it works . # ME: So , it will come up . # ME: Well , we , I have thinked a few evaluation criterias , based on our marketing strategy , on the latest trends , on user preferences . # ME: , we have a seven point scale from true , as well . To false , seven ? # ME: And on base of each c criteria , we need to give a rating . # ME: Well , it look like this . # ME: But we gonna do it here , they said . # ME: So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document . # ME: , well we have the Word document # ME: So we open up that blank here . # ME: Think I can , what this just an example . So , this not very important . # ME: But , if I can get a number in here . # ME: Well , we can't do that . # ME: , so you have to think of it as the remote control is techno technologically innovative . # ME: , and then we have to agree on the rating together . # ME: And in the end , we will c count an average of all rating . # ME: The first on each item . # PM: What do you think ? # ME: , I think it's , well technologically using , it's not it doesn't contain many new features . # ME: , I think I will give it a , a four . # ID: I think the scroll-button is something also new . # ID: What not anoth , not a lot of a lot of remote controls have . # ID: I think technologically I'll give it an seven . # ME: So now i I think you see it its statement . # ID: Oh , true or false . # ME: And you true or false . # ID: Oh , I'll give it a t a two . # ME: And true is one . # PM: So it's a three . # ME: It's a one . The first item . # ME: So , okay the second item . # ME: , this product is for all sorts of customers . # ME: Well , it's a statement which I disagree with , because we really aim at young market and I think the way it looked c totally in yellow , it's not really aimed for all customers . # ME: It doesn't look like that . # PM: Yes , it's for the younger g group . # PM: So it's half of the people . # PM: So I think it's four . # UI: I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons . # UI: So I mean , the colours are for young people , # PM: So , I think it's four . # ID: Maybe version three point O_ has other colours . # PM: Give it a four . # PM: We put the fashion in electronics . # ME: That's the motto of our company . # ME: , well do we do this with this product ? # ME: I think if we do this , as it's uh c it's really orientates on the design . # ME: , so I would give it a two . # ID: Me too a two , because only the battery is not techin technologically high standard . # ID: But the rest of it is . # ID: So , I think a two . # PM: It's not fashion , it's new . # PM: It must be a fashion . # ID: it will be fashion . # PM: It w If it's not a fashion we can put it in it . # PM: So , it must be a fashion . # PM: I think it's a five . # UI: Then make it th three . # ME: Yes , I'll think of that too . # ID: 'Kay . Three is okay . # PM: I use my feet though . # ID: Oh , we'll wait outside . # ME: The next element is the product looks good . # ME: Well personally , I do not prefer a remote control that's fully in yellow . # ME: So , I would give this a five . # ID: I give it a one . # PM: Well , I say three . # PM: So , counting then is two and a half . # ME: We have to do our # ME: So , well we gonna do the next part . # ME: , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . # ME: I have said is not because a low number is better . # ME: And in the end we calculate an average . # ME: So , that's why it's a negative in it . # ME: , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . # ME: So , did we do that ? # ME: Well , if we go to this fashion , I We still have caused a lot of buttons for the numbers . # ME: But you can you can go for that . # ME: And that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . # ME: So , I would give this a two . # ME: , but where is the ? # PM: It does not get lost easily . # ME: , did we implement the sound ? # ID: Just a small thing . # PM: So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ? # PM: I don't think so . # ID: Looks like a pistol . # PM: Not a not a normal shapes . So # ID: It won't get between the pillows on the couch . # PM: It won't get lost . # ME: Okay , well we aimed for the younger market . # ME: , did we achieve that . # ME: I think with the way it looks and it is designed , I will give it a two . # PM: That was our target . # PM: There's a fancy look-and-feel . # ME: That that was , one of the most important things that Trendwatch said . # ME: I didn't say it in my presentation . # ME: well does it have that ? # ME: I would say yes . # ME: Well , let's also give this a two . # ID: I gave this a one because of the rubber . # ID: It feels soft . # ID: , it looks like a l uh b , a bit like a joystick . # ID: , f very fancy trendy . # PM: It's a bit personal . If it's fancy . # PM: So I think s two is better . # ME: And , then the last one I could think of , it goes with the latest trends . # ME: If we looked at the latest trends for the younger people , and they ate fruit and vegetables , well it has a nice colour , well compared to food but we didn't We did not paint any fruit and vegetable on it for something like that . # ME: So , I would did not give this a one or two . # ME: We'll go for a three . # ID: I go for two because the shapes are still round . # ID: , the latest trends are soft things , you know , like I said in my presentation . # ID: But the colours are basic , like yellow , red , blue . # ID: Something what also younger people want . # ID: It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two . # ME: So , come back to the presentation now . # ME: So , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating . # PM: Effort is three , ten and twelve . Thirty , forty , fifty , . # ME: So , we will do that . # PM: So , it's two and three nine two and one third . # ME: So , that's a pretty low rating , I think . # ME: So , according to our own evaluation we did a good job . # ME: How am I doing ? # ME: And I closed your slide-show . # ME: Which one was the last for you ? # ME: Next . Finance . # PM: So , now we have a product . # PM: But , is it cheap enough ? # PM: I'll have a look . # PM: We have a battery . # ID: Cheapest there is . # PM: Okay , one battery . # PM: Electronics . Advanced chip . # PM: it's the most advanced . # PM: Chip-on-print . # PM: We have that one . # ID: Well , it's the most advanced . # PM: We have the simple , regular and advanced . # PM: We have the adva advanced . # PM: 'Kay , so uncurved or flat . # PM: Single curved or double curved ? # PM: We have double curved . # PM: Then we have plastic , wood , rubber . # PM: we have half rubber , half plastic . # PM: Special colour . # PM: Interface , push-button . # PM: Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display . # PM: So , we have the L_C_D_ We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ? # PM: And it's not really a s # ID: Joystick thing . # PM: Now , button supplement . # PM: Special colour . # PM: We already , that's the from the for the buttons . # PM: The buttons are regular colour . # ID: We're not gonna make it . # PM: It's too expensive . # PM: So , we have to change something . # ID: What what are the costs ? # PM: Fifteen Euros . # PM: well when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . # PM: 'Cause we can't lose the battery . # PM: We can't lose the advanced chip . # PM: We can't lose the double curve . # PM: We have rubber , special colour . # ME: We would have n # ID: A special colour . # ID: , I don't think it's a very special colour . # ID: Yellow ? , is it a special colour ? # ME: For a remote control . # ME: For a remote control , I think it is . # ME: If we would have uh normal buttons instead of the joystick . For up down left right . # PM: , then we lose two Euros . # PM: Then we have thirteen Euros . # PM: Half a Euro too much . # PM: Exactly the special colours . # ID: And what if we use only one sort of just only plastic or only rubber ? # PM: That's one Euro . # ID: One Euro discount . # PM: So , I don't think that's good . # PM: I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ . # ID: If we change the joyst the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left . # PM: Then it's only thirteen Euros . # ID: And then we'll lose fifty cent in what ? # PM: Then you have Or you have to cut this off . # PM: Then it's not good anymore . # PM: Okay . I'll have a look . # ID: And if you say it's just a r normal colour it's a normal colour , # PM: Yellow rubber . # ID: No one will see it . # ID: Normal colour , and the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left . # ID: And it's twelve Euros , I think . # PM: One minute , please . # PM: Is it maximum . # PM: , it's normal colour . # PM: But if you lose the joystick , it's still an advanced chip ? # PM: Or it's then a regular ? # ME: The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ? # PM: So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick . # PM: And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ? # ID: If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an regular chip and no L_C_D_ . # PM: , regular chip . # PM: Is it a good design ? # ID: Then you'll have to m see the menu on the television . # ID: And you don't have the L_C_D_ . # ID: So , the T_V_s has to have to be up-to-date . # ME: If we have the n no buttons If we have we have not a joystick but buttons , we would have , we have thirteen Euros ? # ME: And then we move the colour . # ME: What will that be ? # PM: Then it's okay . # ID: Huh . No knew that . # PM: Okay , so no joystick . # PM: Oh no , but we then we get push-buttons from half a Euro . # ID: then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay . # PM: , yes , yes , yes , yes . # PM: No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . # PM: Twelve and a half Euros . # PM: Then it's okay . # PM: So , we have to change that a little bit . # PM: And you cannot use the red and green button . # PM: Because if you give them a s colour , # PM: you have to pay point two Euros . # ID: So , all the buttons has to have to be the same colour . # ID: But then the print on it will g change it . # ID: Make it for everybody to see what button it is . # ID: l How you call it ? # UI: Recognisable . # ID: Recognisable , . # PM: So Well Now we have to change that , but that's okay . # PM: What's the normal colour ? # ID: Oh , well that's clear . # ID: And the joystick away . # ID: And its buttons . # PM: But then it will be just that ones . # ME: still , he waited at the # PM: Now , project eva evaluation . # PM: What do you think of it ? # PM: About the project . # ID: process . Went good . # ID: I think the creativity was good enough . # ID: We have a gun instead of a remote control . # ID: , you were the project manager , and had the final vote . # ID: So that was clear . # ID: Team-work okay . # ID: Everybody has something to say about it . # ID: o only the drawing was very difficult . # ID: New ideas found . # UI: , well the same . # UI: I espe I especially liked the means , the SMARTboard It brings up new ideas when you work with it . # ME: , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal project without laptops and without these devices . # ME: I think Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . # ME: , well the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient . # ME: , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor and you would also see there . # ME: And with a normal mouse . # ME: , and the project . , I agree on what was said mainly . # ME: , but you always have that some people are talking more than others . # ME: And maybe is then the task of the project manager to also ask more to the people less talking . # ME: To tell their opinion . # PM: Well , what do I have to say . # PM: I think it was good . # PM: Not too many discussions . # PM: So , it's good for the speed . # PM: So , I think we're ready . # PM: Evaluation ready .
# PM: G good morning . # UI: Good morning , Flores . # UI: Marketing Expert . # PM: Are you ready ? # PM: You should put the laptop right into the square . # PM: For i for the cameras , yes . # UI: For the cameras Alright . # PM: Good morning , Sebastian . # ID: Good morning , Mister P_M_ . # ID: How are you today ? # ID: How was your business trip to Boston ? # PM: well , actually I didn't go , didn't feel like it . # PM: Do you want to open it as read-only . # PM: I guess I should close it here . # UI: You have the same message of Windows cannot sen oh stand-by . # UI: Close the window . # PM: Okay , the waiting is for our Marketing Expert , Ruud . # UI: That's right . Ruud . # PM: project kick-off . # ID: Is there a schedule for this meeting ? # PM: Yes , there is actually . # PM: I will li list the agenda for today . # PM: For this meeting . # PM: Good morning , Ruud . # ME: Good morning . # PM: it's important # ID: I shall close the door . # PM: It's important that the laptops are exactly on the square , for the cameras . # PM: we're here to develop a new product . # PM: I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it . # PM: this is the first meeting to generate some uh some ideas about it . # PM: you are here in a specific role . # PM: Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here in the role of Industrial Designer . # PM: Is that correct ? # ID: That's correct . # PM: we're going to do uh a little tool training for the tools we are going to use during the meetings we are going to have here . # PM: then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan , and we will have a discussion . # PM: this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes , so we should keep that in mind . # ID: is there any room for a little presentation ? # ID: maybe during the discussion section ? # PM: There is ? , there is . # PM: this new product we are g are going to develop , it's a remote control , a television remote control . # PM: and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly . # PM: Those are kind of easy uh goals , and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop . # PM: we will discuss later on more ideas about how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things . # PM: The market , we should have a look at the market . # PM: we are going to use a pred a project method during this development , which consists of three different design stages . # PM: the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , all of these stages um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then meet to discuss our uh the progressions , yes . # UI: Progressions . # PM: the first stage , the functional design we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will make a specific specification of that . # PM: the second is the technical functional design , what effect should the remote have ? # PM: Well in this case control t the television I think . # UI: It's for the vision . # PM: and the last one is the working design . # PM: How exactly does it work in the technical sense . # PM: the other design stages , we will discuss that later . # PM: So we'll kop it keep it with the functional design . # PM: Okay , before we think about remote control we will work with some of the tools we have here . # PM: as you see now I can give a presentation . # PM: it's also possible to use this one as well . # PM: You can uh display pr two presentations if you want to . # PM: to presentate , to show us a file you'll need to place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . # PM: then we have this electronic white-board system . # PM: , I will show that now . # PM: you can draw on the board using this pen . # PM: There are little # PM: sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the to the end . # PM: well , it it's on the eraser now , so we click the pen button . # PM: Okay , so not too fast writing . # PM: you can insert a new slide or white-board uh file by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . # PM: It's quite the same . # PM: all our whi SMARTboard notes should be kept in the same file . # PM: So do not m make a new file . # PM: Just use this one during the day . # PM: you can use the eraser to make something go away . # UI: But we all use the same white-board file So we can work together on it while we're or should we only use it in the in the meetings ? # PM: , in the meetings , only in the meetings . # PM: It's really like a regu regular whiteboard . # PM: you can choose the format , Let me see . # PM: I guess it's maybe because I'm not s pen selected . # PM: Current colour , you can choose another colour . # PM: And for example black , and you c I can choose the line width . # PM: so now I d have a different line width and colour . # PM: Quite easy , if you do have any questions , just c ask me . # PM: to oh well , I'm I wrote down the documents should be in the project documents folder if you want to discuss it with us . # PM: as a little training I will ask Ruud first to draw uh your own animal on a new slide with a different colour and a different line width than the one now selected . # ME: An animal . Okay . # PM: Okay , well great . # PM: Roo , could you do the same please ? # PM: But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width . # UI: But of course , Flores . # PM: Sebastian is thinking about the animal . # ID: I'm just guessing what should be my favourite animal . # UI: , I'm think about it too . # UI: Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but it works , # ID: Well , I'll give it a try . # PM: It it should be a cat . # PM: I'm guessing a horse . # UI: With a very small legs . # ID: I was very good in drawing . # UI: You should feed that animal . # ID: Well , I guess you get the idea . # PM: Okay , so you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to . # PM: any questions well , just let me know . # PM: back to our project . # PM: the remote control we are going to develop will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros . # PM: the profit we are looking for this product is fifty million Euros , which is quite a number . # PM: we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold , if there is market interest , in more than one country . # PM: And the production costs should not be more than twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by w during the development , because , well , those are important numbers . # PM: then the discussion , maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation . # ID: Yes , I have some technical issues which I would like to present to you before we start the discussion , because there might be some # PM: Limitations . # ID: influations influences . # ID: first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer . # ID: I would like to think about the implementation of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . # ID: So if someone of you comes up with ideas , I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but there might be some impossibilities . # ID: I also will propose some uh some implementations for that , but well , these are quite the same . # ID: Sorry about that . # ID: and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product . # ID: I have some initial ideas about some things which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming discussion . # ID: One thing about interopera operability . # ID: I think a modern remote control should control a device diverse subset of equipment . # ID: for instance , D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment . # ID: So one re one remote control for all your equipment . # UI: And for a cell phone ? # ID: Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them . # ID: I think it could come in handy . # ID: We should discuss that . # ID: and we should think about the way how these things should communicate with each other . # ID: We're not living in the nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not is not really hot technical stuff anymore . # ID: But you should think about the things like Bluetooth . # UI: , but the infrared , it's , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . # UI: But all the T_V_s are equipped with infrared , so # ID: But it's cost-effective . # ID: Well , not all , not all . # UI: y you can Most of them . # ID: So that's the point . # UI: Or you shou sh use a you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote . # ID: but that's something we should discuss and about every everybody should think about it . # ID: So that's just my role , I'll just give you everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what the product should be and how it should look , but take these things into account when you start the discussion . # PM: so the main por the main points you are telling us are focus on the inter operability , # ID: so one thing one remote control should control one or more pieces of equipment , # ID: and the way of communicating with these equipments . # PM: Okay . Okay , good . # PM: that was your presentation ? # PM: I'll go back to my own presentation . # PM: I do think it's time now to discuss mm some things . # PM: Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen implications . # PM: there are other things like how to make it trendy , which is I think most Ru Ruud's role . # PM: the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is Roo r during this part . # PM: so let's start with you . # PM: H how do you think the remote should function for the user ? # UI: Well , I had a few things in mind . # UI: well , the interoperability , just like Sebastian said , the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different , what is it , devices ? # UI: I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in a store . # ID: Yes , I think it should be something like that . # UI: It's not for Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , # PM: Okay , so we're going business to consumer , not we're it's not a # UI: , I do I don't know that . # UI: It's no I have don't have the information for it . # ID: We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? # ID: we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad public , so it should fit to every device . # PM: Ruud , y do you agree ? # ME: , I think I think they're right , . # UI: Well , the techni fu technical function what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . # UI: That's just the basic f technical function . # UI: So that was my really my part for this session . # PM: So is that ease of use or is that more like # UI: Well , that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task as an as an device . # UI: It just should change the T_V_'s state . # UI: but furthermore # ID: And you see the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? # UI: , with buttons . # ID: Or are there any o other controls ? # UI: , or maybe you want a touch-screen or # ID: Are there only any other cont I I've seen these remote controls with this little stick which you can move forward , sidewords . # ID: You know these things . # ID: And it's very easy for a user to switch # UI: They're very vu vulnerable . # ID: to switch b between channels or change between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player . # ID: So maybe that's an idea , I don't know . # UI: And for other user interface I had , well , it's more industrial thing . # UI: point at a T_V_ , I think it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , so you must point everywhere , so maybe infrared is # PM: Maybe not even pointed . # UI: , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should maybe be restriction to that . # ID: is that are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? # ID: So when you're not able to point at the device the range is very limited . # UI: , if you g if you go to radio or . # UI: For T_V_ , you're always in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think the range should be a problem to that , but if you want to get it working with a radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one speaker , then maybe the range should be # PM: Okay , gentlemen , just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting # UI: Two more things . # UI: You should able to feel the buttons without it mis you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface for feeling should be good to understand . # UI: You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think . # UI: And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al in dark too . # UI: So when it's dark Those are two really user interface # PM: I'll write down glow in the dark . # UI: That's perfect . # PM: Okay , I just want to hear Ruud's input for this meeting . # PM: do you have anything already w ab idea about how the market will respond to the such a product ? # PM: Or what we should take in account when developing such a product ? # ME: I think most things have already been said , like control multiple devices . # ME: And , infrared might be an issue . # ME: well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing . # ME: But lots of devices already use infrared . # ME: we'll probably have to implement that . # PM: Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ? # ID: well yes , I had , about three minutes ago , but I've seem to forget them forgot them . # ID: oh yes , I remember . # ID: you said something about visibility in the dark . # ID: would it be nice for a user to have display on this remote control , on which you can see functions ? # ID: Which makes it easier to operate it . # UI: . Well , maybe I but it can be quite simple , # UI: you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it . # UI: The the digits in black . # UI: then it's already visible in dark . # UI: So it don't have to be a lightning or a fancy well , it can be for design , of course . # PM: because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . # ID: Yes , but there's a cost limitation too . # ID: Well , that's more # PM: twelve Euro fifty , . # ID: So that's a big problem , I think . # ID: I think the financial part of this project implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . # ID: The cost price is very low . # UI: Just remind something . # UI: The digits of the painting on the buttons should not fade . # ID: Okay . Very good point . # UI: Always have s the soft buttons , always clear the paint on it . # PM: I ha I have one point f which comes in mind now . # PM: d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily or it should not consume too much power . # PM: Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh every other week . # PM: maybe we could for example only light the buttons that are applicable at that moment or # PM: I dunno , that's more Sebastian's # UI: But then Bluetooth might be problem . # UI: 'Cause I think Bluetooth # ID: It's use a lot of # UI: I know it from the cell phone . # ID: Well , cell phones have integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's it seems to work quite okay . # ID: So technically it will be possible . # UI: But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day . # PM: Okay . Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time . # ID: No , you cannot . # PM: so we will go back to our own work . # PM: next meeting starts in thirty minutes and , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it . # PM: See you in thirty minutes .
# PM: Welcome back . # UI: There's one of mine . # PM: Roo , welcome back . # UI: Hello , Flores . # PM: The waiting is for Sebastian . # ID: Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? # UI: We have a slight problem . # UI: I opened the C_D_ ROM box guys . # ID: Can I get a cup of coffee ? # UI: just cancel it . # ID: during my work I have no time either . # UI: I opened the C_D_ ROM box . Accidentally . # PM: People , welcome back with the second meeting . # UI: But it's alright . # PM: for now on the schedule are a few points . # PM: first of all the opening , which we are doing now . # PM: second , I received some new project requirements . # PM: I'm not sure if you received them as well , but I will tell you about it . # PM: then the three of you prepared a presentation , I think ? # ID: I think so too . # PM: Then we'll do your one uh as la the last . # PM: the top goal of this m # UI: But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe . # PM: we will figure that out . # PM: Ca can you try to # ME: if it if it if it's wireless I could just put it in the . # UI: I don't think it's wireless here . # PM: the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind . # PM: we have forty minutes . # PM: it's now Yep . Okay . # PM: the new project requirements , first of all , we didn't speak about it , but we should not support teletext in the remote , because our b board feels that teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext . # PM: So we are not even going to try to implement it in our product . # PM: It's a board decision . # PM: the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not f feasible , it's not w uh we cannot make it because of the time to market that we have to deal with . # PM: the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than forty , which is important for you , Ruud , and as well for Roo . # PM: Because the product should be interesting and should be bought by people younger than forty . # PM: then for Roo , as well important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . # PM: So the colour colours and the slogan do have to be in the product . # PM: Is that clear ? # PM: Any questions on these requirements ? # PM: the individual presentations , Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ? # UI: how can I and sli and show . # UI: Just press it . # UI: Alright . well w we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous discussion . # UI: the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set . # UI: So that was the main important thing what a remote control should do . # UI: Then I found two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function remote control with many possibilities , but the lack of the feeling I already mentioned in the previous discussion . # UI: And the ease-of-use remote control with the less p possibilities but a great feeling in touching the buttons . # UI: My personal preferences were ease of the easy to use remote control , because the user-friendliness and it can be more trendy in user design . # UI: But your new goal f was for people than less than forty years old . # UI: So maybe the multi-function can be implemented in our design . # UI: But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not in our design . # UI: So it should take out , well , eight buttons or so . # UI: But my in my opinion , the easy to use R_C_ is the best possi possibility for us . # PM: Ruud , did you get that ? # PM: Okay , so the important thing here is # UI: And it's also i indeed uh Ruud's insight in the in the topic . # ME: user-friendly . # PM: In the market , # UI: what does the market want ? # PM: w we will s we all # UI: Just for user desi user friendliness I should choose for the ease of use remote control . # ID: it's still the right thing . # ID: Okay . well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . # ID: basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . # ID: And the m most easy way to do this is by sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . # ID: I tried to implement a picture here , # UI: Energies and # ID: but it's hardly readable . # ID: Can you see it ? # PM: No , it's not visible . # ID: there's a energy source here . # ID: And basically it's connected to three things . # ID: The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . # ID: That's basically the idea . # ID: And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . # ID: what have I found . # ID: Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . # ID: It's cased together , nothing more than that . # ID: It's almost every piece of equipment every piece of every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . # ID: There are some exceptions , but most of all have infrared controls . # ID: And the more luxury remote controls have lithium buttons . # ID: And I think that's what we w # UI: The glow in the dark concept we discussed . # ID: and it's a little more a little bit more fancy also . # ID: So maybe we should consider that . # ID: I have a basic scheme of the things which are implemented . # ID: basically this is all there is . # ID: There's just one chip . # ID: There are a few buttons connected . # ID: the buttons are lit . # ID: And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here . # ID: that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment . # PM: So it's fairly easy . # ID: There's nothing more to it . # ID: It's fairly easy . # ID: It's been done many times before , # UI: Succeed in it also . # ID: and I think we should we should c s succeed in our plan to do this . # ID: So Okay , so personally I think we should infra use infrared , because otherwise our device cannot communicate with almost every T_V_ set . # ID: So I think that should be clear . # ID: another important point is we really should use energy sparse , friendly components . # ID: there are specially designed energy-friendly components which consume far less power than conventional components . # ID: And if we want to use a rechargeable design or a energy-save design , we should really implement them . # ID: for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost circuit board , because most of the production cost are in this part of the equipment . # ID: And the money we save on using this we can use for elaborate fancy lighting techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . # UI: And what's the # ID: I think our users will really will really like that . # UI: if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy # ID: they're p f power friendly LEDs also . # ID: So we can use them . # ID: So that's no problem . # UI: For the same costs , it's can be in our # ID: no , they're a little bit more expensive , but by um making # UI: Combined with the low-cost circuit board # ID: We can we can make its I think . # ME: you could only lit the buttons the buttons that are used most . So , the channel switching . # PM: but the question is whether two or four buttons makes m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to include fancy lightning techniques , I guess . # UI: But I think I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in the device that shines on all the buttons , and not for # ID: Yes . Well , it's not one light , there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . # UI: , but not for each button one LED , I think . # ID: No no , no . That's right , that's right . # ID: So well , this should be it . # ID: have a think about it . # ME: Oh , mine is already outdated . # PM: Okay well , we ar we are very curio curious to what the market will feel about such a product . # PM: So any income is welcome . Input . # ME: then I'm sure the target market is ten million units . # ME: Of of which we should sell about forty percent to make the five million . # UI: Could you step a little bit more to the right ? # ME: But since the other part is forty percent of the market , I thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . # ME: But since the requirements changed , that's not a good idea . # ME: this till true , of course . That they only use ten percent the buttons . # ME: The buttons to zap are used the about fifteen hundred times , when the power button is only used one time . # ME: And the volume button's only four times . # ME: So they're obv obviously the most important buttons . # ME: And lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control . # ME: So we might want to build in a feature to support them . Some audio signal . Like home phones . # PM: that's interesting . # ID: Or a find a finding function , you know . # PM: that's definitely interesting . # ID: That's quite a # PM: It it separates our product from others as well . # UI: Sound signal . # ME: I just said that . # ME: And well , this obvious , and he also said it . # PM: Okay . So that's what the market tells us . # ME: that's about it , yes . # UI: The volume and the zap buttons are the mostly used . # ME: mo zap buttons most . # ME: Volume , they are use a lot . But more than all the other buttons . So # UI: it should just have a design The perfect design for those only those buttons . # ID: Yes , we should focus on that , I guess . # ID: the technical there I think there are no technical difficulties . # ID: There's no elaborate technique used in this kind of equipment . # ID: I don't think we have any hiccups there . # ID: So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really what the market needs . # ID: So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and a sound signal . # UI: the sound signal . # UI: Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? # ME: , that's a problem . # ID: Yes . Th that's a bit of that's a problem . # UI: Another device is not a solution . # PM: maybe like clapping in your hands , # UI: It should be uh # PM: like turning on and off the lights . # UI: but maybe you'll get some new technologies for it . # ID: Yes . Well , there are some devices who incorporate this technique already . # ID: there are video sets and they have a special button , the find the remote control button . # ID: You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a kind of weird sound , and your remote controls then start to beep . # PM: Reports rep respend response to it . # UI: just like the phones # ID: Yes . Yes , that's it . Yes , same thing . # UI: But but T_V_s don't have all uh buttons . # ID: so we should use something else . # PM: because we do not have a home # UI: But I believe you will have an # ID: We do not control the T_V_ set so well . # ME: And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button , you would have to walk to your T_V_ , # ID: and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , # ID: so we should think about # PM: what about the clapping technique ? # PM: because you se # UI: I'm convinced Sebastian will find one solution for us . # ID: It's quite complicated . # ID: it's quite complicated . # ID: Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds . # PM: you see it a lot in light lightning uh # ID: Well , basically the characteristics the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , which is generated a few times within a certain period of time . # ID: But there are many other sounds which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control . # ME: So if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep . # UI: But we can have just uh a home stat f a base station next to the T_V_ . Just a little antenna or something . # ID: so we don't want that . # ID: Maybe we can Something like that . # UI: if you lost th # ID: is there not something f something more easily # UI: I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . # ID: and y the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and b perform a some kind of . And then the remote control reports itself , w we should use have we should use something like that . # ID: You do not want another device , which can be everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control . # UI: just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility . # ID: Yes , something like that . # ID: But that will be very costly , I think . # PM: m maybe w we do agree on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . # ID: So that's not a good idea . # PM: maybe Sebastian should have a detailed look later on and come up with a solution , because that's his field of expertise . # ID: But before I do that I w I want to warn you that by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated and it will become more costly also . # ID: Because there will be additional components which will be used . # ID: And there are some implepe imp # UI: And do we even prefer the sound above the LEDs , the lightning function ? # ID: I think so , because when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . # UI: It's a unique item # PM: , it's a distinction in the market . # UI: It will be an a unique feature of our remote control . # PM: It's a different exactly . It's an uni an unique feature , and I think it's worth looking and probably more i interesting than the lights . # UI: And just about the user interface , I came up with an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . # UI: What should we choose in design ? # PM: according to Ruud , people do not use all the extra features very often . # UI: Well , the extra functions . # ME: I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here . # ME: we won't support teletext which was the third-most the second-most used function . # PM: we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that . # ME: channel selection is obviously the most important . # PM: Okay , so on the relevance scale the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext . # UI: so it just th the basic functions . # UI: And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players and all kind of stuff . # ID: that's out of the question . # UI: Just through the easy design . We can make a nice design when there's not mu much buttons in it . # PM: uh I think we should go for the easier one . # ID: Yes . Well , we should save costs by not implementing a lot of functions and the money that we can save from that we should use for having a nice design and thinking about the user interface # PM: Ruud , how do you feel about that ? # PM: do you agree , do you think the market would respond to a simple # ME: if we include other innovative functions then they might , 'cause young people like new features . # PM: Okay , so this is kind of # UI: just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound . # ID: maybe there's another possibility . # ID: You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , because it has many functions . # ID: Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but nevertheless # PM: But but are we not in the in the manual I mean if you have few buttons , no display , I mean I guess it's l it's working with a shift functions and one button can # ID: I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by these kinds of sticks or something like that . # ID: I don't know if it's user-friendly . # ID: That's your field of expertise . # PM: But but how does how does the remote report r give back to the user w in what state it is ? # UI: I don't know yet . # PM: Because we do not implement a user history . # ID: There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . # PM: I know , but if we use like a stick , for example , # ID: maybe we can use a light for that . # ID: When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe a light next to it can lit up . # ID: So you know I've just pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t turned up the volume . # ID: Something like that . # ME: And if you use that stick for volume control and channel selection , you have the m two most important functions in one button . # PM: and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced functions . # UI: But does it I then should n just use i instead of the stick , like many cell phones , just a round # PM: draw it on the board . # UI: should we just use a it's already oh , we have a blank . # ID: , something like that . # UI: It's just an easy way of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick . # ID: It's not really a stick , Yes . Yes . # UI: A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable when it's falling down # PM: , it can break down . # UI: just a round button should be the trick , I think . # ID: and this also looks more fancy , I think . # ID: I think it will attract more uh public , I think . # ME: A younger Huh . # ID: But you're the marketing man . # ME: And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use . # UI: volume and something like that . # UI: The programme up and down . # UI: And the vol the pen doesn't really does what I want . # ID: Okay , that's good . # PM: but w we still we're still in the question of uh putting in advanced options . # PM: Ruud just told us the market is interested in some advanced new techniques . # PM: however , keeping it simple is important for the costs and all those kind of things . # PM: We need to find a balance between the advanced techniques and the user-friendliness . # UI: But I think our next step to look at is just that . # UI: So I don't think it's we have something to do . # UI: we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that , I think . # PM: we do have to decide this meeting . # PM: We need to have the user function the functions decided and our target audience . # UI: but teletext is so is just scrapped . # ID: Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ? which incorporates all function available on the device ? # PM: I do not want a full it's not necessary to have a full list , but I want the kind of functions , for example th the most important are volume and programme selecting . # UI: The ten digits . # PM: for example , that that's what we should think about . # PM: how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but # UI: and just one function . The the programme to programme button , the switch to two channels , when you have something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which can change # PM: A bit of a split mode . # PM: Dual channel watch . # PM: Okay , well m maybe I should write that down . # ID: you're the secretary . # PM: Ruud , what's your last name ? # PM: Mielsen , because I was writing it down in the last Mielsen . # PM: I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . # PM: So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . # ID: but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already . # PM: that's if you want to do it , Sebastian . # PM: Okay , Okay , so Volume . # PM: dual channel . # ID: Yes , that's important . # PM: And and do we want the ten digits ? # UI: The ten digits ? # ME: if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button . # ID: I'm not so sure . # ID: that's complicated , but is that so relevant ? # ID: Because I don't think but you should shou you should know that . If it were so . # UI: I wouldn't buy it personally . A remote control without the ten digits . # UI: and I think the most # ID: I can imagine when # PM: I agree actually . # UI: Just elder people would buy it , # ID: I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . # ID: But if you're a regular T_V_ user , and you just want to watch the Dutch television networks , well , you can you can use about ten buttons . That's enough . # PM: But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels . # UI: The older people only use five of them . # ID: but how often do you watch all these channels ? # ME: and if we And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . # ID: No , you're probably right . # ID: But I think these ten buttons look a bit dull . # ID: Don't you think ? # PM: it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the # UI: On the design . # ID: then there should be should done be done something specific with it . # PM: You c you can d make them very fancy I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . # PM: So I'm I do not agree # ID: so you can experiment by with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing . # PM: Exactly , exactly . # ME: And there are some numbers about speech recognition here that younger people would like it . # ME: it might be expensive and hard to implement , but it would be a solution for # ID: maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control . # ID: when you add speech recognition to your remote control , it's very easy to change the channel . That's one thing . # ID: And it's very easy to find your remote control . # ID: So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . # PM: If if we would drop the ten digits # ID: But maybe when we # PM: but keep the programme and the volume , because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , # ME: Especially elder people don't like voice recognition . # ME: So then we should implement such a but # PM: But we do focus on younger people . # PM: it's a board decision . # ID: I think it should work , it sh we should manage that . # UI: we have to i to make a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition . # ID: the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . # ID: It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find the remote control button remote control function . # ID: So that's a big advantage , I think . # ID: There's only one disadvantage by implementing this . # ID: the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult . # ID: So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries . # ID: But maybe can we can think something smart about it . # ID: There are some hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . # ID: So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . # PM: But but can we manage it bu for the costs ? # ID: You have to do nothing for it . # UI: Twelve dollar fifty . # PM: Because it seems like a very # ID: Maybe , maybe not . # ME: And if we if we could inc include a c a cradle in which it could recharge , then there wouldn't be a big problem . # ID: I'll have to find that out . # ID: that's very cheap . # PM: Is a cradle very cheap ? # ID: it's very cheap . # ID: That's no problem . # ID: It's just a case with two metal contacts . # PM: b but there should be an adapter as well . # ID: but they're mass production . # ID: They're very cheap . # ID: So it will cost us p practically nothing . # PM: We we have about ten minutes left this meeting . # PM: I would like to hear maybe you all have th things not spoken about , but that are important . # PM: Ruud , you came up with the voice recognition data . # PM: are there other things about the market we should know ? # ME: I think we dealt with the most important information . # ME: Just that the younger part of the market isn't the forty percent we want to sell to . # ME: So we should for least a bit look at the older people . # ME: But with buttons like that , which are easy to use , we might attract them too . # ME: So I don't think that's a big problem # PM: Okay , so although we are focussing on younger people to make it profitable Profitable . We we , we still need to take in account the bit older people . # ME: Yes . , profitable . # PM: Nothing to add . # UI: I have nothing to add , I think . # ID: I just want to make a summary of all things spoken and the different possibilities . # ID: so basically we've decided to implement a seemingly easy design . # ID: on the outside it looks easy , but we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . # ID: So that's one the those are the choices we have to make . # ID: But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by implementing speech techniques , voice recognition , that these kinds of things . # ID: it makes it also more attractable , I think , to our audience . # ID: there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement fancy techniques , which I think our customers will like . # ID: The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about the costs and the things like battery lifetime , energy saving . # ID: another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons . # ID: If we just add uh a chip which does the voice recognition , our circuit board will become even more cheap . # ID: So that's another # PM: and that was the main issue , The the board # ID: it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . # ID: And this even makes it more cheapy . # UI: But the cheaper the ch the chip or th what was it ? # UI: The circuit board . # ID: The circuit board . # UI: The fewer buttons you can use on it . # ID: The fewer buttons you have , the ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes . # PM: It's the other way around , # ID: And it's very cheap to incorporate uh an integrated circuit , a chip . # ID: So that's another advantage . # PM: It shouldn't be a big issue . # UI: then we should just take a look at the costs and especially for the voice recognition . # ID: because I don't know I really don't know . # ID: It can be costly . # PM: I'm not sure how we'll f determine the costs , I will have a look at it . # PM: Maybe you will get some information on that . # PM: I'm not sure how that # ID: I hope my personal coach will have a lo look at it . # PM: I think we're qui quite done . # UI: We're done , I think . # PM: for now we will have the lunch break . # PM: I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . # PM: then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , and I'm sure your personal coaches will assist you with it . # PM: I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder . # PM: If you want to look at it well , just do . # PM: the Interface Designer , I would like to the next meeting I would like to receive the components concept . # UI: Interface industrial . # PM: I'm sorry , I'm sorry . # PM: User Interface Designer , Roo , I would like to see the user interface c concept . # ID: we understand . # UI: the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis decisions Sebastian makes . About the voice recognition . # PM: i it should be easy , that's w what we concluded . # PM: It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . S just a p a p a volume and a programme one . And , some fancy lights . # PM: I think that's what we decided . # ID: So we drop the voice recognition ? # PM: No no , we didn't but it shouldn't be integrated it's of course it's user interface , but i I was talking about really the design of the # ID: do we really have to decide now or can we decide next meeting ? # PM: We can decide the next meeting . Yep . # ID: Because I'll have some updated info on that # PM: I guess all of you have i updated info . # PM: I'm sure the marketing expert will receive t you will do some trend watching . # PM: And I'm sure the market will change , adapt we will see that . # PM: that's it for now . # PM: Any other questions or can we have the lunch ? # ID: We can have the lunch . # UI: I'll take the lunch .
# PM: Do you need to change anything on it ? # PM: Because otherwise I will already open it . # ME: Mm , don't think so . # ME: Unless things have suddenly change again . # PM: Is it much changes ? # ME: Maybe you've got new information , like last time . # PM: I didn't No no . I do hot have Only the same information . # PM: Hello , Sebastian . # ID: Hello hello Mister P_M_ . # PM: I believe Miss Tentel is with us as well , in the control room . # ID: that's where the thinking goes on . # PM: it's that Roo again , always late . # ID: I think you should punish him . # PM: I see some interesting # ID: Possibilities , ? # PM: People , welcome back . # PM: The third meeting . # PM: I have some points I would like to some issues I would like to point out . # PM: first of all , if you make minutes yourself as well , like Sebastian does , could you put them on the shared folder ? # PM: If you do not make minutes , no problem , but it's easy for me to see what you wrote down , so I could can use that in the in the report . # PM: the second thing , I was th s thinking to myself , I have this little remote control , and I'm talking to it , but I still need to point to the television , because it works with infrared . # PM: That's quite strange . # PM: We'll come to that later , I g I think . # PM: the agenda for now uh are there any pre-discussion questions ? # PM: we wi we will have your individual presentations , then the decision on the remote control concept , and the closing . # PM: Forty minutes in total for this . # PM: I think we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations , the progress you've made . # PM: I think it might be smart to look at Ruud's information first , because I understood there are some significant changes in the market situation . # ID: Just press the okay button , it works . # ID: How surprising . # ME: Ease of use is important , but innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is even more important . # ME: And some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables in their clothes , shoes and furniture , and that they want spongy material . # ME: Probably watch too much Sponge Bob . # ME: the older group still prefers dark colours . Simple shapes m material . # ME: But we since we are concentrating on the younger group # PM: w wait a sec wait a se # PM: could you go to the previous slide ? # PM: because I'm taking minutes were the important themes enclose . # PM: The feel of to be spongy # ID: so do you think when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ? # ME: one example given was this , I assume they just want something colourful . Not specifically an apple as a remote control or something . # ID: Not something dull . # UI: But they like dark colours , you said in the p # ME: No , the younger group likes more colourful objects . # UI: then I suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow . # ID: But can you can you go back to that slide ? # ID: just one slide back , no . # ID: and the feel of the material has to be spongy . # ID: Has it something to do with that natural feeling also , do you think ? # ME: But personally I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control . # ME: Maybe soft material or something . But not a real sponge . # PM: Okay , so , it might not be t it shouldn't be too hard . # PM: maybe it rubber # ME: and like the older group likes familiar materials , # UI: Or we could make oh . # ME: but that doesn't mean we should use wood , this is an example of what they would like . # ME: But since we're conten concentrating on the younger group , I think we should use soft materials and make it colourful or like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers . # ME: So we could provide both for the young and the old what they like . # PM: that's interesting . # ID: It's quite interesting . # PM: You could make a few v very colourful ones , and a very traditional co cover . # UI: I'm thinking about the Bananarama telephone from Siemens . The yellow rubber telephone . # UI: It's the it's the rubber cover . # UI: And it's colourful . # UI: It looks likes a banana . # UI: We have the fruit , we have the colours . We have the simple design . # PM: Do you know the phone ? # ID: I don't know the phone , # PM: It's the Siemens C_ twenty five , # ID: but I can imagine it . # PM: I believe it's the one the Post-bank gave away , # ID: Oh , that one , yes . # UI: And the b the light blue and it's also in yellow . # ID: Now I kn oh , I know , I know . # ID: I I've seen it . I've seen it . # PM: You kn you know , Ruud , as well ? # PM: Do you have thit that was # ME: 'Kay . that's about it . # PM: Okay , so the m important findings are innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group . # PM: And colouring is important and soft materials . # ME: soft material . # ID: ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important . # ID: And what was even more important ? # ME: the fancy look and feel . # ID: that's the most important thing for our customers . # ME: Yes . Apparently . # PM: could you do your presentation ? # UI: I don't ha really have much to add , because most of things we already said in the previous discussion . # PM: Okay , well it's good to sum up the things we already thought about . # UI: the previous ideas were voice recognition and the round button for the p channel programming and volume . # UI: a few interface I found on the internet are these . # UI: These are both with voice recognition , but they're very advanced and very high-tech and just , well , a weird shape . # UI: So I suggest I couldn't I had a small mock-up sign on the on paper . # UI: But it didn't work . # UI: My pen didn't load the information . # UI: So I made a really simple f a shape on in PowerPoint . # UI: But we could make a round an oval remote control . yellow . # ID: But it's kind of it's kind of o organic , so that's very good . # PM: And what I'm thinking about , maybe we should make very light but a grip I mean this is how you hold a remote control . # PM: it shouldn't be too glatt , too slippery , # UI: But if you have something like the Siemens phone , it's rubber . # ID: You have to grab it . # UI: So it's easy in your hand indeed . # ID: There are there are also remote controls who have a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in , # PM: , ex for your fingers , . # ID: so you can get a really good grip on it . # ID: So you don't have to attain much pressure to it . # ID: It's it's a lot easier . # PM: . It grips automatically . , # ID: But I'll go into that deeper in my presentation . # UI: to add on Ruud's information , in this interface we can have high-tech with the voice recognition and , well , the fancy colours and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface . # UI: And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and so on . # PM: Way too much I think for our goal , # UI: So if you have the voice recognition , you can you can programme like thirty c controls on it . # PM: b but I think we'll # ID: but I'll go into that , because there are some possibilities and some impossibilities . # ID: I had a talk with our manufacturing division , and we had a talk about all the different components who are in this design . # ID: these are the things we've looked at . # ID: And of course I used the web to find my information . # ID: About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . # ID: We have the uncurved or flat case . that's the most common remote con control form we're used to is just a it ju it's just a box . # ID: I'm sorry I don't have any pictures of this thing . # ID: We have a curved one . # ID: It's curved in two dimensions . # ID: You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form . # ID: So it's a little more advanced in its in its shape . # ID: and we have an even more advanced shape , which is curved in three dimension . # ID: I think you can compare it a little bit with the big grey image you had in your presentation . The the big remote control , something like that . # ID: But it's quite advanced and it's quite daring to use I think . # ID: for these casings we have different types of finishing . # ID: We can use plastic , which is very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery . # ID: We can use wood and titanium . # ID: we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . # ID: And these latex cases , there's just the plastic ones won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source . # ID: Which brings me to the different energy sources . # ID: we even seem to have hand dyn dynamos for powering our remote controls . # ID: You really have to imagine like winding up your # PM: it would be very new to the market , # ID: It would be very new , but it's a kind of a retro style , I think . # ID: this is quite interesting . # ID: there's also a kinetic energy supply . # ID: when you're watching T_V_ or when you're you have to make some kind of energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish . # UI: Like the watch . # ID: It have it has to move , that's the sense of it . # ID: And you can store the energy in the in the thing . # PM: I think , if I can hook on to that , the kinetic thing is very funny . # ID: It's very funny indeed . # PM: I mean solar is of course it's nice , but it's , well , your calculator has a solar panel . # UI: But if you're watching a movie , how many times you take the remote control and # UI: if you have a watch , you have the kinetic idea in a watch also . # UI: You you walk and but you you're sitting on a couch . # ID: But you know you know from your own watch your watch uses a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy . # ID: the shaking of your body , which is almost every activity makes your body shake , it charges it . # ID: But the problem here is that it supplies a very little amount of kinetic energy . # ID: So I think you have a problem when you're watching a movie and you haven't moved the remote i remote control in a in an amount of time , and you want t to switch the channel or something , # ID: it might not work . # ID: So that's something you have to keep in mind . # ID: but maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries and when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries . # PM: because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f a lot of power . # ID: I'll come to that later . # ID: And we of course have the traditional solar power , which is just uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity . # ID: The user interface controls , of course we have the push-buttons and we also have scroll-wheels . # ID: And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons . # ID: So it's just like a mouse . # ID: You can scroll 'em , you can also push it . # ID: in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays , which means you can watch in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is currently and we also have double scroll-buttons , which are just two of these things . # ID: So we don't really have the kind of button we had in mind in our uh in our last meeting , the thing with the round with the four # UI: we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round . # ID: Yes . That is possible too . Yes . # UI: But I th I don't think the scroll-wheels I had some I had some information about it too . # UI: I don't think there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels . # UI: I can't see any scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it . # ID: Maybe when you integrate some functions . # PM: This will be the remote , with maybe a channel selector . # PM: What about integrating a scroll-bar on this side ? # UI: that's a possibility , # ID: it's do it's done before . # PM: Because this is how you keep it # ID: Yes . It's quite good , yes . # UI: But Flores , think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for # ID: what he means is there's an button integrated in the scroll-wheel . # ID: There's no scenario where you use the button in the scroll-wheel . # ID: You just use the wheel . # PM: what about mute ? # PM: Thi i m I guess th this is my volume button . And I can either on this side or this side # ID: that that's one possibility , okay . # PM: And click it to muten the device . # ID: okay . It's quite goods . # PM: And and it makes it different from the traditional devices on this market . # PM: I'm looking for a way to make it a little different than the traditional ones . # PM: So maybe I guess that that's something you two need to think about . # PM: Ruud , wha what do you thing about a scroll-bar ? scroll-wheel . # ME: it's obvious obviously new . # ME: So it might attract the young customers . # ID: But it's done before , there are many other devices like telephones and our radio , pocket radios . # ID: And Well , it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now . # PM: all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume . # ID: So maybe it's not no . # PM: Nokia has a well , okay , it's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this . # ID: but it uses two separate buttons . # PM: I know , it's not really a scroll-wheel . No . # ID: It doesn't use a . # ID: something for Roo here . # UI: I believe if you have what we've earlier said , the grip places in the remote control . You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb . # ID: Wi within reach . Yes , you have to . # UI: So in that case the volume button on the side of the remote control would be perfect . # ID: we have to know , if you want to use these rubber double-curved c case , you must use these push push-buttons . # ID: There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays . # ID: There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved . # ID: There's there are no flat areas where you can incorporate these things . # ID: So that's a limitation . # ID: About the components , just the hardware . # ID: We basically have three types of chips we can use and these chips incorporate all the Logica and um hardware that is needed to send to send a signal . # ID: we have a simple , regular and advanced chip . # ID: And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic to me . # ID: But I think that's the voice recognition thing that we are thinking about . # UI: you can I have some information about it . # UI: in the voice recognition you say a word you can programme words like v volume up . Of mute , let's say mute . # UI: you programme it , you m mute and you g you give an action to it that that's really the mute function and when you speak in the remote control , it repeats your saying . # UI: that's the sample sensor . # UI: So if you say mute , it says mute again , and then it's well , I believe it's # PM: It performs the action . # UI: and then he repeats its action what which he believes it is . # UI: So you say mute , he repeats mute and you makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function . # ID: Okay . Okay , so that's basically the voice recognition item we were searching for . # ID: This sample sensor requires an regular chip , I thought . # ID: no op I'm not very sure . # ID: No , it's not in here . # ID: If we want to use the L_C_D_ display , we really need the advanced version , which is a bit l little bit more costly . # ID: If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version . # ID: And if we don't want to use any of these more advanced functions we can keep with the simple chip , which is a bit cheaper . # PM: Okay . well d did we already decide on the display ? # ID: but I think that's something for Roo here to think about . # UI: I don't have I haven't looked for information about it , but I don't think information y I don't think you need it on a display . # UI: Especially when we have to look at a cost , I don't think # ID: I don't think either . # UI: 'cause all any T_V_ can view a digit on screen , # ID: No . I don't think you need it . # PM: On screen display . # ID: Okay . Okay , well my conclusion , unfortunately the market has decided the a little other than I thought . # ID: I thought the market would like a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural stuff . # ID: So maybe we should think about wood finish . # ID: I've chosen the more battery with solar cell solution for the energy . # ID: It's more reliable , it's cheaper . # ID: So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing . # ID: The kinetic thing it it's a possibility . # ID: It's it's more advanced , but I'm I think you should combine it with batteries . # PM: it's maybe a bit too flashy , # ID: Otherwise it will not too advanced , It's in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries . # PM: but that that's the same with the solar cell . That's no different . # ID: And I think it's more robust . # ID: It's more it's more functional . # UI: But what about the markets wants colourfuls designs ? # UI: So if you use titanium # PM: but the that's what Sebastian said . # ID: The titanium thing we have to skip it . # PM: He said this is what this is my personal preference . # PM: But but yet , I understood that the market is different . # ID: I think we should skip the titanium stuff , and we should use wood or something like that . # UI: And I would think # PM: rubber with colours . # ME: the older people liked wood . # ID: Oh okay , So it needs to be rubber . # ME: the younger people liked soft material . # ID: Okay , spongy materials . # ID: Okay , well these scroll-wheels , I think they can be they can be handy . # UI: And they can be implemented with a regular chip ? # ID: But they really need the regular chip , you cannot use the sa simple # UI: but we also we already need the regular chip for the sample sensor speaker # ID: I'm not very sure . # ID: Maybe that's an a different # PM: But but do we want the curved uh design , # ID: I think so , if you if you stick with the simple straight-forward not curve design , i it's too dull . # ID: I don't think c our customers will like it . # ID: And if you take the double-curved , then you cannot you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels . # ID: So I think this is the best of two worlds . # PM: what about the issue I addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? the voice function w with the infrared issue . # PM: Because it it's of cour # ID: It's it's I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device . # ID: It's very unlogical . # UI: But most infrared remote controls don't have to be pointed at all . # ID: there has to be some pointing at . # PM: It depends also on your on your # UI: if you if you take your hand before it , okay , it won't work , but you can point it just to the other wall . # PM: it depends on your walls actually . # PM: If you have smooth walls , it probably you're probably right . # PM: But if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then , th it might be a bit more of a issue . # ID: All lights get absorbed , because the walls they reflect the infrared light . # ID: So it has an it's easier . # ID: I suggest we use the sensor sample . the sample sensor and sample speaker . with a with a regular chip . # UI: And the regular chip . # ID: I think it gives us the advantage of # UI: And and the scroll scroll-wheels . # PM: I like the scroll wheels idea . # ID: And skip and skip the L_C_D_ part . # ID: I don't think it it's any value added thing . # UI: No . Think so too . # PM: it looks according to Ruud , the market likes new flashy technology , # PM: and I mean L_C_D_ is # ID: It's not very flashy and new . # PM: ok I know , but it's m it's less s standard # PM: than we are not very w we do not know much about the f the financial part . # PM: That's the problem . # PM: Because if we do have enough space in our finance , I would say do integrate it , because it adds a little ext extra high-tech feeling to it . # UI: But we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp the speaker the speak recognition , the rubber , the fancy colours . # ID: I think our customers will go insane . # ID: It's it's too much . # PM: I think i Ruud , do you have any anything you would like to add or maybe thoughts # ME: Nah , n no , I don't think so . # PM: Sebast Roo ? Roo , do you have any other # UI: no . Nothing more . # PM: Nothing more . # ID: the n the next phase will be the not the what is the next phase f Flores ? # PM: we need to describe decisions now . # PM: on the energy , well , we decided . # PM: The case rubber with c one curve . # PM: User interface # UI: but can't scroll-wheels work with one one-curved case ? # ID: Yes , they can work . # ID: They cannot work with double-curved . # ID: That's that's problem . # ID: I'll check it for you . # PM: then the corporate identity should be in the product . # PM: I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian . # PM: you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow . # PM: Keep it in mind . # PM: And the buttons , well we talked about it now . # PM: The next phase , Sebastian , is the design of the look and feel . The user interface design . # PM: And for you , the product evaluation . # PM: I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that . # PM: and the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard . # PM: And I'm going to plan my holidays . # UI: The project drawing is for the next # ID: So you will be on the Bahamas . # PM: it's when we come back in thirty minutes , you will have a prototype ready . # ID: can you give us a summary of all decisions we've made ? # PM: maybe one of you could write it down . # PM: you need to help me . # ID: start with the casing . # PM: The casing is curved , single-curved . # UI: Single-curved . # ID: Okay , single-curved case . Okay . # ID: What about the energy source ? # PM: Traditional batteries and solar . # UI: But can there be wor can they work together ? # UI: Or do we have to choose between them ? # UI: 'Cause if we have to choose # PM: they can be complementary . # ID: I think they can . Yes . # PM: Every device # ID: It it should be . # ID: There should be really no problem . # ID: They can be supplementary . # ID: That's no problem . # ID: just the energy source is the batteries and the solar . # PM: Battery and solar , . # ID: What about the finishing of the case ? # ID: We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ? # PM: , with colourful rubber . # PM: if it's possible with different covers , but I'm not sure if our suppliers can help us with such uh a wish . # ID: and I think we should use the company colours . Something like black and red . black and yellow . # PM: grey and yellow or black and yellow . # UI: Grey and yellow . # ID: Grey yellow , okay . # UI: Yellow case and grey buttons , I think . # PM: , although I don't think that's very colourful . Except for the yellow of course , but I could think of a more attractive c set of colours . # ID: I think it's not very dull . # ID: It's quite modern actually . # ID: Don't you think ? # PM: I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before . # UI: I believe the But you have already you must have a red on and off button . # UI: And Well well # PM: it doesn't have to be red . # PM: I mean th I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for . # PM: so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours , it should be a full colour cover with such an image I mean thinking in two colours is too black and white for our m c market group , I guess . # ME: Or black and yellow . # PM: Black and yellow , . # ID: but I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on the device . # ID: Because I agree it would be nice to have something like that on the device itself . But # UI: Just a week ago , a keyboard manufacturer would print , # ID: but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its techniques . # ID: They're actually very slow in its techniques . # PM: so we have to deal with wh what's possible here . # ID: So I'm afraid it's not possible . # PM: more f more decisions we made . # UI: A scroll-wheel . # PM: The scroll-heel . Yes , the voice recognition we already decided . # UI: Voice recognition , of course . # ID: Okay , so scroll-wheel . # ID: But there will be some additional buttons , I guess . # ID: And th the they should be spongy also , because they're rubber too . # PM: I'm going to leave that up to you two . # UI: What what did you say ? # ID: you can use when you use the buttons , they'll be made of rubber too . # ID: So it has th the spongy feel also . # UI: or you could use plastic buttons . In the rubber . # PM: I think rubber is nice . # PM: Because it i I mean what do you touch the button , and what do they want spongy uh devices , # UI: But then you just have the fact that the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually . # UI: What I said in the in the first discussion , the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber . # PM: is that does our supplier say so ? # UI: It is not something it's no information I read about it or so , but it's just from # ME: didn't did we inc include the digi digits or leave them to the speech recognition ? # ME: 'Cause things like volume could be placed next to the button . # PM: You could place a this would be the button . # ME: There the icons . # PM: The scroll-wheel , I mean . # PM: And you could place the indica th the signals the # UI: that's possible , # ME: So you don't touch the icons that much . # UI: but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case . # UI: So still then , if you feel li if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting . # PM: No no , there's no painting , only yellow or But it's into the rubber . # UI: but the plus or the minus . # PM: but this is on the pla # UI: You have to draw the # ID: Yes , the signs . # PM: , I know . I think I know which you understand af I know what you mean . # UI: it's on the cover . # UI: So if you You just move the problem . # PM: What about making this rubber and making this plastic ? # ID: I see what you mean . # ID: maybe that's possible , because our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing . # ID: So maybe they can combine these two . # PM: Well actually , we should have it the other way around , I guess . A plastic cover with rubber finishing . # PM: I mean , this is this is the finishing . This is what's on the edge . What you feel . # PM: But the front , on which the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber . # ID: I'm not so sure , # UI: can you separate these # ID: I think it c should be I'm not sure , I have to ask with manufacturing , but I'm not sure that's what you want , because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel , and that's what you get with rubber . # ID: So if you want the spongy feel , you need to make these buttons all of rubber . # PM: but do you touch this or do you touch this ? # PM: I mean , I never touch between the buttons . # UI: Or the s the sideways . # UI: Or the back . Or the back . # PM: , the side , exactly , the sideways . The side , but do you touch between the these buttons ? # UI: I think especially when there are l a few buttons on it , you have a lot of space to touch . # UI: So you just have it in your hand completely or i you play with it . # PM: Okay . Well , we do not have very much time left . # PM: I guess you two have to figure that out . # PM: I'm going to leave the decision to you , because you have to make its prototype , you have the most knowledge about the suppliers , the possibilities so I'm going to leave it the decision with you . # PM: Sebastian , did you write enough decisions down ? # ID: what about the chips ? # ID: We use the regular chip ? # ID: I think that's about it . # PM: With those regular chips we can still control advanced functions . # PM: The chip is not really # ID: The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced version of the chip supports L_C_D_ . That's all . # ID: And we've decided not to use L_C_D_ . # PM: then I think we are quite finished . # PM: I'll see you guys in thirty minutes # UI: For the finishing touch . # PM: if you write wrote anything down , could you put it on the shared folder ? # UI: But Sebastian has everything . # ID: I'll put it online .
# UI: That's the same as on the top of it with the round button . # ID: Like this one . # UI: But we don't we don't we do think it's well what if with ease of use , w which prefers the which the customer of the user prefers . # ID: It's important . # ID: I think th this is device which has a learning curve . # ID: novice users u use this device as normal users use a c a remote control . # ID: And after a while they start to develop some skills in the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often . # ID: But other users who are new to this device need something like that . # ID: They n they need to understand what how to change channels and change the volume , so it's easier for them # PM: Could could I see the scroll bar as a sort of shortcut ? # PM: A a and the voice recognition as well , # PM: th maybe you could # ID: it's another approach , it's more that our . # ID: There are there are many ways of doing things on such a device . # ID: It's it's quite easy . # PM: Okay . Okay , And and the case is rubber ? # PM: And the buttons ? # UI: Plastic or rubber . # ID: There are plastic or rubber . # PM: and the colouring ? # PM: with grey or black . # ID: grey or black or something like that . Whatever cost the least . # PM: we'll come to that later . # PM: Anything else to add # ID: maybe we should think about these buttons . # ME: you could use two of them to programme the channels on the two channel button , 'cause you have to assign two channel new channels . # ID: but these are tasks that are only executed once , I think . # PM: M m but maybe you do want a programme button to for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice recognition . # ID: okay . Okay , that's right . Or something li like that . # UI: And a button for disabling the voice recognition . # PM: al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it you'd disable it with a little beep and but o okay , that that's not really important . # UI: That's the basic idea , . Of our prototype . # PM: The basic you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ? # ME: my name is not name # PM: You are nameless . # ME: I used the documents . # ME: And these were the most important criteria . # ME: that's how the fashion guys state it . # ME: Fancy look and feel . # UI: just walk through it step by step . # UI: I mean , is it fancy , everything I believe I believe it's fancy . # ID: I believe it's fancy too . # ME: but apparently we shouldn't evaluate yet . # PM: Okay , so these are the cr the criteria . # ME: I think these are the most important criteria . # PM: Okay , well the then we'll switch to my presentation . # ME: that's about it . # PM: The production costs . # PM: The costs are not under Can I this is the # PM: it's w way above the twelve Euro fifty . # PM: And what makes it very expensive is for example the solar cell . # PM: So I guess we should skip that , # ID: it's very expensive . # PM: because it's not that important . # UI: Why does the price and the s one exa # PM: the price , the number of items and the sum . # UI: The number of # PM: this is what I would call our luxury model . # UI: And and does it # PM: if you look at the w what we could do to make it more to make it just between the twelve Euro fifty , then I did the following changes . # PM: Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , by not using the voice recognition feature , because it's a four Euro addition to the price . # PM: I believe , push-button , It makes it the thirteen Push-buttons are buttons are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost . # PM: th this design is not within our price model . # ID: But I'm afraid it's not complete . # ID: Because we use spec specic special materials , the last item . # ID: And you have not added one item there . # ID: So it's c way too expensive . # PM: It's still too expensive , . # UI: But that's only for the buttons . # PM: I guess if we leave the if we leave this one out , # UI: So the button we can use plastic . # PM: And maybe not use the special form . # UI: And the pla And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas instead of rubber . # PM: It becomes a very dull remote control , I know . # PM: But it's the board decision . # ID: Well , b basically when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in an enhanced case with these dull functions . # PM: Maybe we should look at an focus on another # ID: Type of m maybe another market segment . # PM: maybe not all that fancy , but just way more easy uh basic and m maximise the profits # ID: That's maybe that's better . # ID: Maybe we could we should go for straight and simple , but that's not what has been asked . # ID: we should kick the board's # PM: Although I think we , but we could still make a remote control that ap applies more to young people by giving it another colour already . # PM: it is possible to make uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people . # PM: but I agree it's not a fancy high-tech device . Definitely not , no . # PM: It's not that innovative . # PM: Or however you s pronounce that . # PM: so , okay . Oh , this is the wrong one . # PM: that means redesign . # PM: We do not have the time o now to redesign the product . # PM: but we can evaluate the process and uh the satisfaction on how things went . # PM: I'm not sure if we need to evaluate the device first . # ME: since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway # ID: maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we can also determine if our objectives are good . # PM: We l we can learn . # ME: Is it ? Is it fancy ? # UI: the yellow rubber , I think so . # PM: You like the rubber , Roo . # ID: But it's not that fancy . # PM: I'll give it a two . # ID: I think I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing the casing . # ID: It would be even more # PM: You like tita # ID: oh , you really like titanium . I'm into it . # PM: That's a flavour as well . # ID: It has flavour . Yes , that's right . You should taste it . # PM: but it but that's fancy in the way I mean fancy has a lot of # ID: It has to do with fashion , I guess . # UI: It's trendy , fun # ME: w what they want wanted was colours and soft materials . # ME: So in that way It it's fancy . # UI: just give it a two . # UI: It's not the ultimate fancy two , but # ID: I think I th I think it would have been I would have think it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . It would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar . # UI: but that's sti that's Looking at the user needs , we only don't we don't have the double-curved case . # UI: We w we do have the rubber , we do have the colours . # UI: That's two out of three . # UI: So I believe we are close to two . # ID: Yes , I agree too . It's okay . # ME: Okay , and was it innovative ? # PM: with the voice recognition feature # UI: But that's not in it . # PM: we are evaluating this design now . This prototype . # ID: let's this product . # ID: So I think it is . I think it's innovative . # UI: And the scroll wheel . The solar not many remotes have the solar , I think . # ID: It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic energy source , but it's way too # PM: That would have been a thrill . # ID: I think it's a two . # ME: Is it easy to use ? # PM: I'm not sure . I'm not sure . # UI: the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think . # UI: it's not for the for the e for the elderly . # UI: They won't use it . # ID: but there are two parts in this remote control . # ID: What you see here is the basic part . # ID: Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use . # ID: That's for a novice user . # ID: When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions . # ID: So in that in that way it is advanced , and I think it's easy to use for both types of users . # UI: I think I think a three . # ID: It's maybe it's not very easy for # UI: Wouldn't give it more . # PM: I'm doubting as well . # ME: the most important function is easy to use . The the zapping , channel switching , volume . # ME: But the more advanced functions are probably a bit harder . # PM: or three ? Three ? # PM: Wha wh what would be your guess ? # PM: I mean ease of use does not only apply to the most basic functions . # PM: It's the it's overall . # PM: Is the device easy to use ? # ID: , that's right . You're right in that , but I guess an advanced user will find the voice recognition function easy to use , because he is already he or she is already an advanced user . # ID: After all , I think personally I would give a two . # ME: Good question . # ME: I'll go for the two . # ID: So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . # PM: I could make it e easy ? # UI: If you make it a four it will be three in general . # ID: So that's w two and a half . # UI: If he makes it a four . Not a three . # ID: Six and four . Six and four is ten . # ID: Divided by four is two and a half . # UI: A seven , a three A four and a three together . # UI: you have a two , he has a two . Three ? # ME: two , two , three # PM: I haven't said anything yet . # PM: but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five . # ID: Divided by four . # UI: So if you want to have the conclusion as a three . Then you would make a four . # UI: If you fill out a four # PM: But I'm filling in a three . # ID: That's not even # PM: Does it will so it will be a two point five . # ID: But that's not possible to fill in , # ID: so we have to round it . # ME: Is it easy to find ? # PM: It's not about the content , it's about is it easy to f , definitely . # UI: we haven't re really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find . # ID: It it most definitely is it's very easy . # UI: but that's the that's the basic idea of the speaker # ID: I think I think # PM: I'm here , I'm here . # ID: something like that . # ID: Maybe you have to programme it once , so to that l respond to a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that . # UI: But even without it # PM: we should not stay too long on this subject because of the time , but I personally give it a one . # PM: The feel of the remote control is spongy . # PM: it can't be more spongy . # ID: There are cases in which the outside casing is can be how d how do you prono is moldable . # UI: Was it one of our options ? # ID: No , it's not one of our option , # ID: but when you look in the market , when you look # ME: this was a most spongy option . # PM: for the options given , it's the most spongy one . # ID: but that's not that's not what they are talking about , I think . # ID: Because we compare all these characteristics with market with the real market . # ID: there are remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . # PM: They're out there . # UI: But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could . # ID: Yes , but it's not good enough , # PM: I'll give it a one . # ID: What do you give it ? # ME: it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could # PM: but you have to name a fig a number . # PM: Because we need to go on in for the time . # ME: if I give it a one there'll be one hell of a calculation . # UI: It will be a one . # ME: So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five . # ID: I'll change it , I'll make it m my mark will be a four . # PM: You are The remote control offers enough features . # PM: Ruud , what do you think about it ? # ME: the basic layout doesn't offem offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . # ID: Basically it's completely programmable . # ID: You can add very m much functionality by using the voice recognition mode . # ID: So it's quite advanced . # PM: What what we didn't talk about is # UI: but it ha doesn't has the digits . # UI: I believe it's If you ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think it is it has all the features a normal remote has . # PM: I think it has . # ME: depends on what you implement in the speech feat # PM: Bec because you can we didn't talk about it , but you do have remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . # PM: you place a regular remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the signals . # ID: Has the signals sent to it . # PM: So you could uh enter any comment you like , as long it's able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal . # PM: So I think th this is a remote control with a very high level of features . # PM: Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is quite advanced . # ID: But that that's its power , I guess , because a regular programmable remote control contains , well , really a lot of buttons . At at least forty buttons . # ID: So it's quite s complicated to get to get used to . # ID: And this is quite s simple . # ID: You can use your voice to programme it . # PM: let's give it a number . # PM: I'll give it a one . For for the for this t type of market , I think it's a one . # UI: I'll give a two . # ID: , I'll give it a one . # ME: I think a one , 'cause v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like # ID: I I've I think we've succe succeed in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price . # PM: So high quality , low acceptance . # PM: The product is b high qua has a high quality and is advanced . # PM: But whether or not our clients are willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is well , is not sure . # PM: D do you agree ? # ME: Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced . # PM: Maybe we should have a radar function . # UI: But we could couldn't what what's the selling price ? # PM: Twenty five Euros . # UI: And costs were twelve fifty . # UI: But even now , if only our production costs w were exceeded the double , Think . Production cost was were t was twenty two ? # UI: selling price would be # ID: M about fifty Euros . # ID: That's quite ex # UI: That's price , but w # ID: it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that has this functionality . # UI: An original remote control of any T_V_ kind , a Phillips remote control , y you pay # ID: it's more than fifty Euros . # ID: It's quite expensive , yes . # UI: I kn I know from a few years ago , it costed hundred Gilders . # PM: Bu but well but you're paying for th for the brand , because there are remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros . # ID: Yes . Yes , but you can you c but you can learn this thing , all these functions . # ID: And it's easier to use because those remote controls don't offer voice recognition and this one does . # ID: So I think it's worth its price . # PM: you had an overall rating . # ME: but with these ratings # PM: That's counting . # ID: it's about one point five . Something like that . # ME: should be about one point s seven , # UI: Four six seven eight . # UI: Nine divided by six . # PM: we'll go further on with the rest of the evaluation . About the project itself , not about the product . # PM: What did you think about the process , the project process ? # PM: Try to translate that . # PM: Any any other # UI: The process was good . # UI: But w we weren't aware of the prices of the costs . # UI: And and that was the big deal . # UI: I if we knew that before , we c we could have made # UI: the choice between what # PM: Better decision . # ID: We had we had too little information actually . # ID: the looking at room for creativity , there was w way too the choice of components was way too narrow . # ID: So there was not really a process of # PM: So we could we could be we could've been creative . But it was tempered by the choice of components and the price . # ID: in the first meeting we already were very creative . # ID: We we thought of possibilities who are not possible with the current offer of manufacturing components . # ID: We're tempered by that , yes . # PM: Roo ? Any other thoughts on that ? # PM: You agree , okay . # PM: Okay , Roo's on for his promotion . # ID: I think we're a good team . # PM: I think so too , it's of course a laboratory environment . # PM: I missed it to be able to contact you in between and say , hey Roo . # ID: I tried once , but that was not allowed . # PM: but si w when taken in account the situation , I think we performed pretty well . # ID: I think so too . # PM: the means , the SMARTboard , the digital pen . Did you like 'em ? # ID: The digital pen was okay , but SMARTboard was really bad . # PM: Because of the response # ID: The response is very slow and the possibilities are very limited . # ID: It's not accurate . # UI: it has . , it's not accurate . # UI: The p the pointing of the pen is not the place where it writes its where it , where it draws . # UI: the drawing on the b on the board is r right from the pen . # PM: Okay , so it had to be better aligned , or what's the word ? # UI: You to take in account that your you m # ID: Maybe it's it needs to be calibrateds . # PM: It it was calibrated just before this meeting . the one before , the third meeting . # PM: So it's not the calibration , it's the thing itself , I think . # PM: Ruud , w did you use the pen a lot ? # PM: I thought it was quite a handy thing , # ID: I think so too . # PM: although I would like to see O_C_R_ . # UI: If it has O_C_R_ , I think I would use , but I just took notes for myself and that's it . # UI: It w it w It was necessary for me to # PM: To digitise them . # UI: because if I want something on the computer , I just type it . # UI: I type faster than I write . # ID: But I think it's a great solution for a known problem , writing down some notes , some inf information , and then forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information . # ID: Because you have everything in one place and it's quite easy quite easy it's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way . # ID: I think it's a good product . # ID: I only think it's th the shape of the pen is too big . # ID: It's not quite ergonomic . Eco ergonomic . # PM: Ruud , what did you think about the SMARTboards ? # ME: I only use it to draw a rabbit , # PM: Okay , you can't really decide . No . # ME: so can't say much about it . # PM: I missed a feature to easily select a slide and distribute it to the laptops . # PM: I think that would be very easy if you could say okay , I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on # ME: or the other way around . # PM: Or the other way around , that you could show but m # ID: That's quite what PowerPoint does . # UI: if you save this image , you can open it in your shared work folder . # UI: So it's almost # PM: but we couldn't use that feature , so I missed it . # PM: We weren't able to do that . # PM: At least the I wasn't explained how to do such a th # UI: A and the function of filling an oval or an object . # ID: An object , yes . Yes . # UI: I it's not possible # ID: The drawing cap capabilities are very limited . # ID: And and w you were when you're using Windows , you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons , which you can use for drawing . # ID: And a lot of these buttons don't appear here . # UI: Oh it looks like paint actually . # PM: Okay , so it's not even as advanced as paint . # ID: Not not n not way . # ID: It's quite limited . # PM: , the project is evaluated . # PM: but , well , we need to redesign the product . # ID: Okay . Oh , very good , celebration . # ID: Pop pop up the champagne . # UI: It was a privilege working with you . # PM: you're dismissed . # PM: No , I think we are ready . # UI: To private rooms ? # ID: I see some action over there . # PM: Private room , Roo . # PM: That sounds quite scary . # PM: No , let's find the way to . # ID: we're done , we're finished , I believe . # ID: are there any more cycles in this process ? # PM: I don't believe so . # PM: maybe we'd get an email . Thank you for your # ID: But how much time did we get for this meeting ? # PM: Forty minutes . # ID: And how much time is left ? # PM: A minute or ten maybe . # PM: we can redesign our I would like to # ID: I think we all know what the redesign should be . # ID: A simple , dull , one-coloured box . # ME: And no added value . At all . # ID: it's just the same product that is already on the market . # UI: But you see the problem , y you can't continue your line . # UI: it's fluffy alright . # ID: It's a giraffe eating a eating leaves from a tree . # PM: It's blue tongue . # ME: In interesting design . # PM: This is a new model . # ID: So you're actually promoting Bluetooth . Or blue tongue . # ME: Oh it does have a natural feeling . # PM: That is it's a new feature next to Bluetooth to disable all Bluetooth devices . # ID: Let's wrap it up . # PM: we're done here . # PM: Gentlemen , thank you for your cooperation . # ID: Thank you Mister manager . # ID: Now , let's have a bottle of champagne . # UI: Leave it here . # UI: That's alright .
# PM: good morning . # PM: This is our first team meeting . # PM: I'll be your Project Manager for today , for this project . # PM: My name is Mark will be giving this presentation for you to kick the project off . # PM: That's my that's the agenda for today . # PM: of course we're new to each other , so I'd like to get acquainted first . # PM: So let's do that first , Let's start with you , can you introduce yourself ? # PM: You're our Marketing Expert . # ME: my name is Dirk , Dirk Meinfeld . # ME: I will be Pr Project the Marketing Expert . # ME: And I will see what the user wants and what we can do with the new produ project product . # PM: Okay , excellent . # PM: And you are User Interface # UI: Nick Broer , User Interface Designer . # UI: I'm going to look at the technical design from the user point of view . # PM: Excellent . Okay . # ID: My name is Xavier Juergens , I'm the Industrial Designer , and there are three main questions that I have to find an answer to today . # ID: First one is what happens inside the apparatus , second is what is the apparatus made of , and the third is what should it look like . # PM: What should it look like ? Okay . # PM: let's kick it off . # PM: Oh , there we go . # PM: our new project is about we need design a remote control for television set , which has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . # PM: I took this off our corporate website . # PM: I think well it sums up what we need to do . # PM: We're inspired by latest fashion , not only electronics , but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design . # PM: That's why our product will always fit in your home . # PM: So apparently we need to be very at very open to what's currently hot in the market . # PM: So that's what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want . # PM: we put the fashion in electronics . # PM: So that's what we need to go for . # PM: Anyway , we'll take this project in three steps , three pha three phase of design . # PM: First step will be the functional design . # PM: And that's basically what we're gonna do . # PM: Everybody has a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards , so we can share information I'm gonna keep this short , since we had a technical problem . # PM: So skip through this . # PM: Every meeting we everybody can present their views and everything , so to help with these , you have we have the SMARTboards here . # PM: We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation . # PM: I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board , actually it's very easy . # PM: Like it says , very simple , you just take out the pen . # PM: Like you see here , I'll just take the take here . # PM: That's it , you just put it on the board . # PM: You see a pen here . # PM: You go here , just like using a pen . # PM: You can just draw whatever you want . # PM: It's like the eraser , can erase whatever you want . # PM: And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views , if you wanna change the format , you just either take out jus just like the pen , and whatever you want , your current colour , your line width , just to make the line bigger . # PM: So it should be really easy . # PM: This is to take the just take a new slide and back again . # PM: We're just gonna keep using this board all the time , so I think it will be it's very clear for everyone , I suppose . # PM: I'll take this out . # PM: We'll use that later . Anyway . # PM: , just stuff that you wanna share , just put it in the in the project folder , like I put my presentation now . # PM: I'll put the minutes of every meeting , I'll put them there too , so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever . # PM: next , been here . # PM: gonna give the electronic white-board a shot . # PM: basic idea is we have a blank sheet . # PM: Just try whatever you want , and like it says , draw your favourite animal . # PM: I think the creative genius should go first . # UI: The creative genius ? # UI: Thank you very much . # PM: So , draw us your favourite animal . # UI: I'm more into the technical aspects of drawing , so I'm not really good at drawing animals , # PM: Draw us a technical animal . # UI: but the animal which I Oh . # PM: , it's still erasing . # UI: Else my animal will be like king-size . # UI: I pretty much like a dolphin , because of its freedom basically . # UI: actually worked with this . # UI: It's like it's a very high-tech . # UI: Bit low-responsive though . # PM: So that's what we don't want . # UI: Prefer pen and paper . # PM: We want a high-responsive product . So It looks more like nuclear bomb . # ME: Very nice dolphin . # UI: It doesn't look like a nuclear bomb . # UI: This thing isn't doing what I'm What I want . # PM: Let's go easy on it . # UI: , well it does look like a nuclear bomb . # UI: I'll just finish up real soon , because I'm So it doesn't really look like a dolphin , # UI: but then again , this is all new for me . # PM: it should It It's supposed to be a dolphin , you like the freedom that it that it represents . # UI: Like the ocean , like swimming . # UI: Do that in my spare time , so that's basically an # PM: What do you like ? # UI: Now we can forget this ever happened . # PM: our Marketing Expert . Show us an animal . # ME: I like the elephant . # PM: pick a clean sheet . # PM: Oh . Take a clean sheet first . # PM: Just press next . # ME: I like the elephant . # ME: It's big , it's strong , so uh Oh , it's a little bit # UI: It's not really that responsive , no . # ME: You have to hold it , It's a beautiful animal . # ME: you have to p press it pretty hard . # ME: With a smile on it , # PM: It's a cute elephant . # ME: it's very important . # ME: And not to forget its tail . # PM: It's a nice beard . # UI: And you was making comments on my dolphin . # ME: I will beat the dolphin . No . # PM: Okay , so it's just a bee . # PM: I suggest you make us the elephant in the market . The big and strong player in the market . # PM: This would be good . # PM: Okay , excellent . # PM: On to the next one . # ID: you should press next . # PM: Press next . , it's up there . # ID: Okay , well the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger . # UI: You picked a hard one , didn't you ? # ID: My drawing skills are really bad , so . # ME: Experience with the tiger . # ME: What ? They are # ID: They are really bad , my drawing skills . # PM: Sure looks smooth . # ID: I'm not sure how the legs should go , these are stripes . # ID: I've picked this animal because it's very fast . # ID: it knows exactly what it wants . # ID: it hardly ever wastes any resources . # PM: What does it want ? # ID: well , basically it hunts for prey , but it does it always in a very well-thought way . # ID: it knows exactly what it wants . # ID: It never kills an animal just for the killing , so it's very efficient . # ID: And it tries to do everything as fast as possible . # ID: And it always goes for security , in seeking uh a hide spot and doing everything , security , speed and efficiency is important . # ID: And I think those things we can use . # PM: , I'm supposed to draw the animal next . # PM: I introduce to the world the amazing ant . # PM: Great team-workers . # PM: Do everything to really small , but together they're really strong . # PM: So I'm gonna give it a smiley face . # PM: Not sure where the p . # PM: Just put 'em here . Whatever . # PM: Think it need shoes . So I'm just too lazy to draw it all black , so That's the coolest ant ever . # UI: You've done this before , haven't you ? # PM: I love to draw ants . It's my hobby . # PM: Anyway Nah . Just I think it's very representative what we drew , I guess . # PM: Like you take just take your freedom and use a trendy interface that you design for us . # PM: You're supposed to make i make it different from what other people have , and just make it a little distinct . # PM: another beep to stop the meeting . # PM: Warning . Finish meeting now . # PM: put this down . # PM: I guess we have a little time extra , Just a little quick discussion to open our work . # PM: So what do you guys think about The first idea is just very short . # PM: I'll start with you . # PM: What are y What are your first ideas for the new product ? # UI: I basically had a question . # UI: Are we going to introduce a multi remote control ? # UI: Is it just the T_V_ or do we want to in # PM: The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control . # UI: Just for T_V_ remote control . # UI: I was thinking about design remote control , with our motto and all . # UI: thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with . # UI: No rational changes or whatever , 'cause it revolutionary changes , # PM: so very intuitive design , I guess . # UI: we might have to consider other design aspects of our product . # UI: So that was something I wanted to add , and perhaps some usability aspect . # UI: T_V_ is becoming central in most homes . # UI: Do we want people who are disabled in any way to , to be able to use it as well ? # PM: , we want I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it . # PM: So I think I mean , really disabled people , might be a problem , but I think it's a little take it into consideration . # PM: I think we really need to cut the meeting short . # PM: You have anything you wanna share quickly ? # ID: Only one thing that has to be added according to me is the material it is made of , it should be something light . # ID: it speaks for itself , # PM: It should be light , okay . # PM: , let's see , where did I Let's skip that . # PM: I skipped this sheet . # ME: Selling price . # PM: What do we This Quick What we're going to Selling price , twenty five Euros . # PM: That's for you . # PM: The production price , twelve and a half Euros , approximately . # PM: Just go for that . # PM: We'll reach the reach that profit . # UI: Okay , well that's not that much to work with . # ME: international . # PM: No , it's not much to work on . # PM: I'm sorry , I skipped it . # PM: Anyways , that's , this is it . # PM: Do you have anything you came up with yet ? About marketing transfer , whatever ? # ME: about what ? Marketing ? # PM: Marketing I'm not sure what you what you came up with yet . You have anything to share ? # PM: Or else we'll cut the meeting just cut the meeting short # ME: no , not really yet , # PM: since we're supposed to stop . # ME: but I've some ideas and I will say it # PM: Anyways , the personal coach will give you the your p your personal assignments and everything . # PM: So we'll just meet back in here thirty minutes . # PM: I'm sure we have that . # ID: Good luck everyone . # PM: thanks for attending . # PM: I'll see you back here in thirty minutes .
# PM: Wait for the marketing director actually , Anyways . See , shall we wait ? # PM: I'm not sure if he's late or delayed or whatever , so I'm gonna start soon , we have now don't have much time anyway . # PM: There you are , # ME: a little bit of pl little problem with computer . # PM: We're about to start , so have a seat . # PM: welcome again . # PM: Today , functional design phase . # PM: I'll take you over the minutes of last meeting . # PM: that was just to get to know each other , have a little thoughts on what your vision is and on this project , I put the minutes on the I made on the on the p the project share , so if you wanna review them , they're there . # PM: I will do so after every meeting , so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there . # PM: Anyways , today three presentations , from every one of you . # PM: after that I got some new project requirements from project board , so we're gonna go af go after over this later . # PM: But I wanna start with stuff you did first , so we can see what everybody came up with . # PM: And after that we can have the new requirements and share some thoughts , Who would like wanna go first ? # ME: , sure , no problem . # ME: there was a little problem with my computer so not the whole presentation # PM: Anyway , let's see what you have . # PM: it's still a bit open . # ME: I want to open the my s # PM: You should close it on your own notebook , I guess . # ME: The functional requirements , it's very important for the user , he wants to The the method we used it it's not m not a slide , because it went wrong , but the method we use , we tested it w with a hundred men , and we asked them to w what the remote f feel like and what what's important . # PM: If I can cut in , is it people or men ? # PM: Is it people , okay . # PM: 'Cause I thought it was only men , # ME: Both women and men , the findings seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly . # UI: That's pretty shocking . # PM: So we have to s we have to do something about that . # ME: most th they want to spend money for a better system , for better remote control , so we can do a l a little nice things with it , and they use , they use zap a lot , fifty percent say they only that's the most important things . # ME: not all of it is it on mine on my PowerPoint presentation , # PM: just talk ahead . # ME: but the relevant buttons are the power , the channel selection and the volume selection . # ME: It's the most basic buttons that a user wants to use . # ME: less important is tel teletext , they use it , but it's not very important on the scale of zero to ten they six and a half # PM: Okay , that's okay . # ME: but not important is the channel selection , the # PM: That's a little weird . # UI: Which channel selection ? # ME: the no , that's very important , but w and not important in the audio settings , display settings # PM: we can we can hide those under a menu or something , # ME: new preferences . # ME: um beep to find your control , # PM: That's like a button on your T_V_ ? # ME: that was in the test , the most people f find it irritating when they cannot find a rem their remote control , # ME: so I think it's a bee beep to sound it and you can find it . # ME: And another thing they want was speech recognition so they can say what they want to let's go to channel one and that's kind of things . # ME: And they want maybe an L_C_D_ screen to look it wh what's on every channel and what do I want with it ? # PM: We wanna have a little preview on the remote control . Preview what's on the channel . # UI: Is that manageable ? # UI: 'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too . # PM: That sounds too It's possible , but I think it's expensive , but do continue . # ME: my personal preferences is a button for my favourite channel , so I can I dunno , so I can zap to my f quick to my favourite channel wh what I so , the remote mu must see or must see wha what mine preferences are for which channel , # PM: you don't set it yourself , # ME: so I can zap t to # PM: it just remembers the channel that you are on most , for example . # PM: You want the you want it to be programmed , for example y programmed f or you want it to recognise your favourite channel ? # PM: Let's see , you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel , # PM: so it recognises your favourite channel . # ME: , that's what my personal preference like . # PM: Okay , so it's it does it recognise itself , you don't have to set it # ME: Maybe it's easier to sell it , I don't know it's manageable , but we will we will see . # ME: it's a little bit it's the end of it . # ME: It's a little bit I lost it , the computer crashed , # PM: No problem , it's okay , go ahead . # UI: some technical functions . # ME: Darn computer . # UI: Basically I have some issues which you discussed earlier . # UI: let's just start with the method . # UI: It sounds really easy , what does the user do , what does the th remote control do , but there are quite some issues . # UI: the things I'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect , because the technical aspect , that's pretty much covered . # UI: We can do that . # UI: What goes wrong at the user . # UI: Gets the remote control . # UI: Where is the remote control ? # UI: We've all had it once , I want to watch some television , where's the remote control ? # UI: That was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder , # PM: That seems very good . # UI: a really good idea . # UI: these are just the issues . # UI: I come to some personal experience , findings , possible solutions later . # UI: Searches for the button . # UI: There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear . # UI: so either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear . # UI: also symbols tend to fade after a while . # UI: There's nothing more annoying than faded symbols , because you don't know which channel is this button , so possibly we could find something for that , # PM: Okay , so have it more make it more durable actually . # UI: covered that . # UI: user presses the button . # UI: usually when you have a lot of buttons , buttons are small . # UI: So you press more once remote control goes kablouey or something like that , # PM: Okay , so the buttons should be # UI: so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on the remote control . # UI: And possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger # PM: Make it make them bigger . # PM: Even more durable . # UI: this is basically what I h had in mind in the fade-proof symbols , locator , a sound , clear we should stick to existing symbols , but maybe we could do a little investigation to see whether some symbols are need to be replaced by others . # UI: This I pretty much covered . # UI: So what we want to go to is not this one , # UI: but more less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons . # UI: that's basically what I had in mind . # UI: This is not the final design , # UI: this is just a general idea of how I'd like to see basically the general idea . # PM: I must say that it # PM: That was it . Okay , that was good . # PM: So we agree on the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it the durability of the thing , # UI: , I think it's a really good idea . # PM: The other aspects , we'll just see how what you came up with and what's possible for that budget . # ID: Okay , that's fine . # ID: Okay , now work a little with me . # ID: Okay . Well , let's start it as it is . # ID: the method . There are a few questions that need to be answered , you already talked about it a little bit . # ID: Which buttons are wanted , is our remote control universal or should it be programmable . # ID: if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need something like a mode that you can switch it . # ID: Because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do . # ID: And how big is the remote control going to be ? # ID: I'll tell you why that's important to me . # ID: there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control , so uh that's why I also would like to say go a little bit easy on the designs , I heard ab you talking about beeps and about video screens , but the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already . # ID: So keep in mind that everything that you keep think of , it has to b to be built . # ID: that's not as easy as it s might look like . # ID: material study , I'm working on that for the costs . # ID: I have to check out how far I can go with that . # ID: Normally , a circuit board is made of fibreglass and the wires are made of copper . # ID: that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way , I think we can just go on with that . # ID: then I've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production . # ID: The more we can make at once in one piece , that is cheaper . # PM: You mean integrate them all into the circuit board . # ID: Exactly , so if we make a circuit board with the connections already on it , then that's cheaper . # ID: So we have to make something that's not too difficult in design again . # ID: This is what look like looks like if you press one button , so this is not the entire thing . # ID: You have the power coming in , then you have like a switch . # ID: The switch uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a Morse code , that's how you should see it . # ID: The Morse code goes to the amplifier , then the signal is sent to two light bulbs . # ID: You have infrared and an interv how to say it ? # ID: a light in indication , light that you know that it's functioning . # ID: here again , that's my story about the different modes , if you do want to make remote universal , then the processor has to make up a different Morse code when some button is pressed . # ID: That makes it much more complex , so we really need to have a look , do we want that or not . # ID: I don't have any personal p preferences so far , except for the materials to be used light , that they are light . # PM: I'll get back to my thing then . # PM: back this up to the screen . # PM: I got some new information on the project specifications are changing a little . # PM: Like you said teletext is not very popular anymore because the internet , nowadays people don't use the teletext anymore or hardly , so it can either I don't think we should remove the button , because there are always people who are using it . # PM: But I don't think it should be very it should be one of the big buttons for example . # PM: Just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever . # PM: It's not important anymore . # PM: we're targeting young people now , because our This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people , which are the younger people were defined under forty . # PM: I so I think it's that's also good with the fashion and everything , # ME: and they want to pay for it # PM: They want to pay for it , people are willing to spend money actually to buy a remote that they like . # PM: If they like the way it looks , the way it functions , so they're actually gonna spend money on it . # ME: With more Where with more technical specifications # PM: see how far we can go with it anyway , so And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable , which is apparently black and yellow , but I'm not sure if we I think we should keep the logo in mind , because with colours you can have a lot of fashionable colours and everything on it , which suits everybody's taste . So With that concept I started thinking , so why not just steal Nokia's idea and just make changeable covers for your I mean those cost hardly anything I think , and people could even spend extra money on buying a cover and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see . # PM: Or we can sh for example we can make a different a basic design . # PM: And sell the covers separately , for example . # PM: That's just a little marketing idea that could be applied , so you can p it appeals to really everyone . # PM: So you don't have to I think you don't have to make entire remote controls . # PM: We make a basic one and manufacture this cover separately . # PM: that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone . # PM: I'm not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime , after making a presentation . # PM: Would you like to share ? # ID: I think this is a good idea . # UI: Is it manageable ? Is it easy ? # ME: with an L_C_D_ screen you can # PM: I think we should lose the L_C_D_ screen , # ID: Y Yes , I think so too . # PM: like you said . # PM: I think for example it's huge I think the L_C_D_ is huge , # PM: it consumes batteries like hell . # PM: I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power . # UI: And it costs too much to fabricate , # PM: It costs a lot , I think . # UI: so we're on a tight budget here . # PM: What we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an L_C_D_ screen but with a preview , but y I'm not sure if it's even possible . # PM: For example , a little T_V_ guide . # PM: Like you have a little just a text only , not colour , just a little text thing so you can use your remote as a T_V_ guide . # PM: I'm not sure it's even possible , # ID: I have to check that out , # PM: but maybe okay , make it # PM: find a little compromise in that , What did I write down ? # PM: I think the p , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement , just make a button on your T_V_ # ID: That must be possible . # PM: and just hit the button , it beeps somewhere . # PM: I think it's easy to implement , we should go for that . # PM: speech recognition . # ID: whe where do you wanna hit the T_ you wanna we want a button on the television . # PM: I mean where else should you put it ? # ID: but that rules out a universal remote control . # ID: Because that's not possible . # PM: but how are you gonna use that if your I mean if your remote control is lost , how are you gonna press where are you gonna press the button ? # UI: Maybe just a slap-on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal . # PM: A slap-on sticker . # PM: you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your T_V_ . # PM: , that could be possible . # PM: A little box you can attach to your T_V_ is fine then , okay . # ID: then I'd like to know now if we want the universal remote control or not , because that's determines everything I'm gonna do . # PM: I think it's universal . I think we should go for universal , because apparently we're a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people . # PM: I think universal remote control should be possible . # ID: then I go for that . # ME: Everyone wants to buy it , # PM: I think we're targeting everyone , so remote # ID: it's fine with me , but then I know what to look for . # PM: Okay , universal is good . # PM: Speech recognition , I think it's very hard , because we're selling across multiple countries . # PM: So I think implementing speech recognition is such a small apparatus , it's very hard to do . # ME: Or when you say one two i it it's enough , # PM: but I don't see Arabian people speaking one , two whatever . # UI: Besides that , the technology isn't really super yet , so that is a problem in implementing this . # PM: It's not a mature technology , I think it takes a lot of memory and everything in a remote control , # UI: It's a good idea , but it's just not I don't think the market's ripe for that yet . # PM: I don't think it should be implemented in a remote control yet . # PM: What else do we have ? # PM: you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable . # PM: So the symbols won't fade , maybe a little harder plastic # PM: or especially li we don't # ID: I already noted that . # PM: maybe we don't have to do all the buttons , but especially the ones that are the popular buttons , so those always fade first . # PM: Mm the thing is the most important things that we have now . # ID: If we make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make a cover for every language area . # ID: That's fo is especially for older people , that they can read it read it in their own language . # PM: we're not we're not targeting older people , we should remember that . # PM: Everything we target is under forty , # PM: You assume that they read correctly and I think they're The most important thing about young people is that they're really sensitive to trends that are passing through the world , # UI: But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves or just the # PM: No , of course . No , I think it's just something you put over them , because we c , you ca Well , tha that's not a that's not a bad that's not even # UI: that's a problem with the with the text then . # PM: it's not even a bad idea . # PM: I mean , for example , if you're if you're into the durability issue you could For example , if your buttons are faded , after I mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover . # PM: I'm not sure it's hard to make . # PM: So it's a good and a bad idea . # ID: but I know that the buttons are like a Nokia telephone on one sleeve , so you don't have to change your whole cover . # ID: we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve . # UI: Oh , I know what you mean . # ID: Know what I mean ? # ID: It works the same as a Nokia telephone , it's in my 'kay . # PM: it's just a one piece of rubber for example , # PM: that's what I something I have to look into . # PM: Either either change both the buttons and the cover or just the cover , I'm not sure which is easier , anyway , this is what we're gonna do afterwards , just lunch break and have more individual work after that , so let's see what we let's see we you have to come up with a components concept , I want some you should do some trend-watching , because even if we're if we're gonna do those covers and everything , what people really want , that's what we need to know in this phase , because that's gonna be the essential final design that we're gonna come up with . # PM: I think user interface is fairly obvious . # PM: I mean it should be very intuitive , # UI: Pretty straightforward . # PM: it should speak for itself . # PM: for example I bought a remote control last week with a new T_V_ , it was it l it's like all buttons and you have no idea what it does at first , and I'm total T_V_ new , anyway . # PM: I think it should be have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second level menu for the advanced things . # PM: Or maybe just stick 'em under a menu , like you said the sound options and the surround and whatever , they're more complicated , just stick 'em under one menu and give it a just put it in s in a software piece , you can menu and you can select everything you want to set on your T_V_ . # UI: Is it techni technically possible to send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu , because we're working with different types of television , so we're going to work with that ? # ID: I don't think so . # PM: No , that's true . # ID: No , I don't think so . # ID: Because the television needs to respond to the signal , # UI: It's an in-built menu , # ID: and if it doesn't know how , it's # ID: Exactly , that's not possible . # UI: So basically # PM: I'm not sure if it's impossible , but there's a chance it's not , # UI: Or we could use a double-sided for less used functions # PM: A double-sided remote control ? # PM: I don't think that's useful . # UI: with the cover . # UI: it's basically an idea to overcome these issues , # PM: but then you're gonna have a lot of wasted buttons . # PM: For example you have a Sony T_V_ and the half of the buttons won't function if you have a for a Sony that won't for a Philips T_V_ . # UI: but basic functions but functions which are not frequently used . # PM: I don't think we should # UI: Because if we use a universal remote control , we're going to have to have most buttons on it , # PM: for exam I'm not s you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that it should do what people usually do with their T_V_s , not the very complicated settings that you can usually do that with either a old remote control if they really hate that thing , but you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s . # ID: But that might be broken . # PM: I think there's I think there is a standard for example between because usually the menu is the menu button is usable between different brands . Especially the big ones , the big brands , 'Cause everybody I have a universal remote control and it can use the menu button , so I think I'm not sure , if you can put some research into that , if it's possible . # PM: I think just a b # PM: and the navigation is very basic , it's usually the same thing . # ID: Mm . But I think there must be a way to invoke the more complicated functions of a television . # ID: For instance , if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours , then you should be able to get everything out of the television that's in it . # PM: . , that's true . I think so # ID: Because otherwise you'll lose functions by buying our # PM: we need to put some research into that if we can open the menu , I think it's possible , just the way how to . # ID: I thi I think so too . # PM: then you could do everything I suppose , because usually the T_V_s have tha that inside in this other little piece of software , so it's okay . # ID: And I think that our r remote control should not look like any other . # ID: For instance Sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices , and you always grab the wrong one because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same , only the labels are different . # PM: I think it should be a little distinct from everything else , # ID: We should not do that . # PM: because it's either it's both mayb # PM: maybe the shape can be a little different . # UI: I have some ideas . I have some ideas . # PM: Maybe it's a little more curves or whatever . # ID: Mm that's your division . # ME: And with different colours . # UI: I'll put some on paper and present them next time the ideas that I have . # PM: Not sure what because we have forty minutes , I'm not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway , # UI: I heard a beep go . # PM: but it wasn't me , it was him closing something . # PM: So anyway , we could do some i do some work now on the design for example . # PM: I mean what do you want , do you want , but # UI: but we like some curves # PM: may maybe something like this . # PM: But though smooth inside . # PM: So you have the transmitter here for example . # PM: Let's see that you what would be handy . # PM: I think that the buttons should be the channel buttons should be on their own . # PM: Let's see one , two God damn it . # UI: we get the general ideas , yes . # PM: Another one here . # PM: Let's see what I think this should these are always on top of the of the control , so they should be here . # UI: and since you're holding it like this , I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume # PM: Think it's like this . # PM: Withi within the just take it . # UI: you have the up channel the down channel the volume , do we want that horizontal or vertical ? # PM: Do you take triangles # ME: it's fine , I think . # PM: I think it should be I think it # UI: This is basically what people are accustomed to , # PM: Maybe we should make 'em bigger or whatever . # UI: but this is just a g general idea . # UI: maybe the menu button can go i in the middle . # PM: , in the middle . # PM: It's it's usually there , # ID: Perhaps we should also make something like a flash on it , if you if it's lost , for people that are deaf . # ID: They they won't hear the beep . # PM: but for example if it's lost in your armchair , we'll not see the flash . # UI: You won't be able to find it . # PM: And flash takes up a lot of batteries again . # ID: , it's true , but it's only has to do so when you press the button that it's lost . # UI: We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up . # PM: I thought about for deaf people for example , We could do that . # ME: Just a light on it # UI: So we have the basic channels we've got here , the power button somewhere over here ? # PM: that thing should be central . # ME: Very important . # PM: You shouldn't be you shouldn't press it by accident , but it shouldn't be stacked away somewhere . # UI: I usually press it on top . # UI: At least that's what I'm accustomed to . # ID: I have another idea , # PM: like that's gonna work . # ID: I'm not sure if it's possible . # UI: What would you like to ? # PM: I thought maybe we should move the buttons down # PM: and put it here for example # ME: And you are reading from the t you always read from the top to the bottom of it . # PM: From top to bottom . , that's true , you should I think the bu the power button should be on top , 'cause it's the first thing you do , turn it on . # PM: So power button on top . # UI: mute button . Is that somewhere here ? # PM: Do we hardly I think it should be at the bottom somewhere . # UI: Is that used often ? # UI: The mute button ? Do people use that often ? # PM: Mute . Turn the sound off . # UI: 'Cause I'm pretty much accustomed to it right over here , at least in general , # PM: I don't think it's important , but I think it I think it should be you c # UI: It's not that important , no . # PM: you could put it somewhere here . # ME: Or or with the volume selection . # PM: because it people are accustomed to that , # ME: Around not at top at the around the volume selection . # PM: Can I have that ? # ME: I don't know where exactly , # PM: Take this out and here see are we gonna take triangles anyway ? # PM: I'm drawing triangles , # UI: That's pretty much what people are accustomed to , aren't they ? # PM: it's maybe a bigger lesser than thing . # PM: So anyway , I think this is should be the channels and or sh # UI: I'm accustomed to the channels being on top . # ME: , that's better . # PM: should we chan # PM: this two , channel up and down . # ID: Shall we also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote ? # ID: That you don't have to buy new batteries if every # PM: for that is it's on one part it's a good thing to recharge it # ME: Maybe it's more ex expensive . # PM: Maybe we should what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example . # PM: You have just put Penlite batteries that are rechargeable , because it's an it's very annoying . # UI: But isn't that expensive in the entire package ? # ID: But that's already possible . # PM: I'm not sure y I'm not sure it's if it's expensive , but just take a look at it , because it might be a very good idea . # PM: Because if it's useful to have it rechargeable , but at the same time , if you don't want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wanna watch T_V_ now , you wanna be able to put different batteries in it , use it now and not in half an hour . # ID: you could make a device , but I'm not sure how that is possible with the costs , that you can put in normal batteries , rechargeable , # PM: I think I have a nice idea . # ID: but it you're the remote also can act as a recharger . # ID: So then you can choose , you have every decision . # ID: Know what I mean ? # ID: You can put in normal Penlites , rechargeable Penlites , but they can also be recharged with the remote , with a wire . # PM: I think it's a pretty good idea to have like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_ . Could be flat , you could insert your remote into it . # ID: But I think that will cost a lot . # ID: a normal wire would be better . # ID: Like a like a P_D_A_ , a hand-held . You can just put it in the electricity and it charges itself , # PM: we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal # ID: you don't need basic station . # PM: So you could put that on a T_V_ for example . # ID: That is possible , that's true . # PM: It could be very flat , could be very small . # PM: It's a very small I'm drawing it big now , So you can put your remote on flat for example . # PM: And at the backside of remote just a little hole for example you just put it down , it recharges for example . # PM: I don't think it's very expensive . # UI: But again , isn't that too expensive ? # UI: 'Cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries , a docking station # PM: I'm not sure if it costs a lot , that that's what he r That's that you that's what you buy yourself . # ID: I'm going to try to find that out . # ID: I'm not sure if there's information available on this , # PM: It's just an idea , we have to find out if it's possible . # UI: And do people actually want that ? To pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable ? # ME: , they want to pay for it . # PM: Do they want but they want a rechargeable one ? # PM: I'm not sure , you should find out if it's if rechargeable is important . # ME: Th there was not a el ask esque # ID: These are comfort issues . # ID: So I think people will pay they wanted to pay for comfort . # PM: They want to pay for comfort , # ID: this is comfort . # PM: we just assu we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it , we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station . # ID: I think this is a brilliant product . # PM: I think it would be good actually . # ID: I would buy it myself . # PM: I like the beep part anyway . # PM: let's go through the # ID: I like the covers . That's a brilliant idea . # UI: Can can we save this or # PM: Covers is covers is good . # ID: I never thought # PM: we can save this . # PM: We even saved the ant . # PM: Okay . So what we have is you have I think you have to do a lot of work on if it's possible for the cost . # ID: I hope if I have information about that , I'm gonna # PM: or maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay . # PM: We are going for twenty five Euros sales price , but just try to find out what they're willing to pay for it , because if they're willing to pay more , we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers , we just have to see what it looks like . # ID: I would like to make a decision . What it costs and what kind of materials that we can choose what we want in it # PM: if you have some financial information that that'd be nice , # ID: exactly , I need it . # UI: Could you post some other essentials of what people want , so that I can work with some buttons , where to put it You seem to have information on that , I'd like to see some of it . # ID: Was it not possible to send emails around the office ? # PM: No , it wasn't allo # PM: it was possible , not allowed , So that's why I'm not sure that you're allowed to share documents on the on the draft . # ME: My computer crashed , # PM: I haven't heard any complaints yet , # UI: Oh , your computer . Okay . # ME: I lost my presentation , I have the # UI: I have your PowerPoint presentation , I can get some inf information out of that . # ME: Here I have the s the homepage of our internet , # PM: the oh , they inc # ME: and here is my # PM: they include the new one . Or just for you . # UI: where would we # ME: here is my marketing report , maybe you ca you can look at that # PM: no , I didn't have that . # UI: Where would we want the teletext button ? # UI: Because we decided that it's n not that important . # PM: All it tells just let's make a new # UI: Do we put it somewhere over here ? # PM: tick the new one . # PM: let's increase it a little because # ME: And wha what people want , I've # UI: Or maybe this is something for the next meeting , I can draw out some ideas . # PM: draw us up some designs of possible # ME: I have another thing # PM: just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , so the more less important # UI: we have decided more or less the basic structure . # UI: I can put the other buttons in # PM: Just play a little with this , shift a little up or down and we'll see what looks best . # ID: What what did you wanna say ? # PM: Or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share . # ME: what I al already said is the remote controls are always lost , # UI: Maybe another idea . # ME: but it it's also for people , they want to learn it fast , not they want to # PM: we don't want we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot . # ME: it's easy to learn # UI: but it should cover all the functions , so possibly , just an idea that popped in # PM: we had function that what people do , People change channels , people they change the volume and they change channel , they turn T_V_ off and on , for example . # PM: That's the basic fu that's what you do I'm not sure who present that again , but those are the basic function that people use it for , so those should be very well represented . # UI: but we could go a step further , # UI: because some T_V_s have the possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus . # PM: That's true , but that's what we stick under the menu button . # PM: Everything is you say in every T_V_ that's configured under the menu . # UI: Because we're making # ID: But that's the question , Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu . # ID: If it isn't , then we cannot reach it . # UI: We need to adjust to the technology . # PM: But I think most modern T_V_s have it in their menu . # ID: I think so too . I think so too . # ID: isn't there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ? # ID: If you rule out functions , then and that gets known , then people are not gonna buy it . # ID: Then the consumer bond or something says you cannot do this and that with it . # ID: That's a bad com commercial # PM: we'll see what we can come up with . # ME: Another thing I want to say is that we are looking at the market for the age younger than forty . # ME: on my report , I didn't ish I didn't show it in my presentation , because my computer crashed . # ME: they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . # PM: The want to pay for # ID: Did they really said it like that ? Those two things . # ID: Do they realise how much that costs ? # ID: That's almost undoable . # PM: Younger , age sixteen and forty five . # UI: Oh , we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then , with an L_C_D_ screen . # PM: That's all here , here it says # ID: Even if i if we have this lost unit , then we cannot do it for that price . # PM: age sixteen forty fi interest in main features more critical . # PM: Okay , so we're not focusing on this . # PM: All the interest in features , not really the L_C_ Would you pay for speech recognition in a remote control . # PM: Speech recognition is quite # ME: We can look at the possibilities for an L_C_D_ # PM: just look at the possibilities then , # PM: because if apparently it's what people want , it's supposed to be a luxurious remote , # ME: How much it will cost # PM: maybe it's not even that expensive . # PM: Or find a compromise , maybe just a black and white or for some extra information on it , on your programmes . # ID: But I really need finance information . # PM: I mean we all do . # PM: I think it's something we should put into consideration . # PM: Apparently it's what people want , We should see if what it costs , if it's possible . # PM: we should do a little thing about design , because it looks boring really to me . # PM: Even if you put it even if you put a different cover on it , it looks still looks boring , # ME: Different colours maybe . # ID: And the design , it should differ . # ID: This is Philips , # PM: I have no clue . # ID: Philips has this . # PM: I just drew something what which would fit into your hand easily . # UI: I had basically Something like this . To make it kind of futuristic . # ID: I realise if we make it small , then it needs to be a little thicker , # PM: I think it's a very # ID: because I need to put all the electronics in it . # ID: If we make it s smaller , less wide , then we need to m make it a little thicker , because I have to put all the electronics in it . # PM: but you have to j just keep in mind it shouldn't be too heavy . # PM: I mean we can stick it in there , I think . # PM: if in the worst case we can even # PM: Could you give me the pen back ? # PM: let's say that people would want an L_C_D_ thing . # PM: Let's take the basic design again , what we oh , crap came up with . # PM: I'll just make it a little bigger now . # PM: a transmitter here . # PM: We could let's say we have an L_C_D_ screen , people want an L_C_D_ screen . # PM: So then we should probably put it here . # PM: It doesn't have to be really big , but just have to be has to be there . # PM: Think it's a good place , people don't # ME: If you're reading from top to bottom , I think it's better to put it at the top . # PM: It's not that it's not the most important function , it's just an extra thing , it just you press the buttons on top , # ME: . But i if you if you are going to put the L_C_D_ on it , I think it's very important to use it , # PM: because your finger is on top . # ME: because it's use it # PM: How can you use an L_C_D_ screen ? # ME: But nee the function of it . # ME: So you can use it maximum , because it's a lot it costs a lot . # PM: but why I I'm not sure . # UI: Now it's pretty much tucked away in your hand . # PM: if you t if you press a button , you can see it , I'm not sure wha I'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like . # ID: I personally would prefer it on the top . # PM: You would prefer it So we have three people saying it should be on top . # PM: but then you would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else . # ME: It's expensive to build it , # PM: this looks a little # UI: I'm still not convinced of the # ME: you must use the maximum of it . # PM: About the L_C_D_s thing . # PM: if it if it's if it's possible wi if it's not too expensive , we should include it , # PM: because it's cool . # ID: We should just try to make that if it's possible . If it is possible we should really do it , but we need that information . # ID: Also keep in mind again , the L_C_D_ screen is very flat , but it needs transistors , resistors , I don't know what more and that needs space . # ID: So I have to look if that's possible . # UI: So basically # PM: we have green now # UI: what we have to decide now is what goes on top . # UI: Do we put the volume control and the channel control here , or do we put it on he Would we like to press it in the middle ? # PM: Or maybe we should m we could draw something a bit that has it on the bottom . # ME: In middle of it . # ME: In the middle . # PM: Maybe in a circle for example , like we like in this example . # PM: I think this is not good , but for we could make circular buttons for example . For up and down , ma make it a circle on it , # UI: but we do agree that we keep this at the centre , # UI: because it's basically the most important function . # PM: I think the channel button should be in the centre . # ME: It's the most import . # PM: Channel button should be st stick together , for example here in this section . # UI: that would make them quite small . # PM: We're not sure about the size anyway , # UI: So maybe you'd put them here . # PM: just a general design . # PM: You can make it as big as you want . # PM: For example if you take # UI: but a big remote control probably not something which people would like . # PM: For example just # ID: If we have a space issue , we can also lose one battery . # ID: It is rechargeable , so we can stick with one instead of two . # PM: I don't think if we if we even use an L_C_D_ screen , we need to , definitely . # ID: That might be an option . # ID: but if we need two batteries and an L_C_D_ screen , that means a lot of space that we need . # PM: but we have to see what the si what the size is . # ID: But it has to be a little bit heavier . # PM: The L_C_D_ doesn't have to nee doesn't need to be very big . # ID: but the things behind it . space . # ID: Like a process . # ME: Finish meeting now . # PM: Finish meeting now . # ME: It's on your computer . # UI: would we like this or would we like the # PM: We either we have to decide what people want . # ID: I like this one more . # PM: Either this one , this could be the luxurious one . # PM: So we have channel buttons here . # PM: I'm just drawing something . # PM: I think this would this would look cool . # PM: You could have it for example small buttons here for some extra functions , so if your basic function's here , we should like we decided before , programmes up and down , and volume here . # UI: Let's see what we have here . # ME: And what about speech recognition # PM: you can just no , I'm not sure if we can do that , but we could put a microphone in here for example . # ME: or an L_C_D_ or an speech . # ME: I think it's L_C_D_ is better now . # PM: Just to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space . # PM: But let's cut the meeting for now yes . # ID: One more thing I'd like to say , let's give this a name , and not like some vague serial number that no one understands , like with cars . # ID: Shall we all try to think about a name ? # UI: So I think of a name . # PM: , let's think of a name , okay . # PM: Okay , at anyways , the minutes will be on the on the web shortly , so there we go . # UI: go and finish up and I'll see you at lunch . # ID: Do we save the ? .
# PM: Can I close this ? # UI: we don't have any changes , # PM: here we are again . # PM: Detailed design oh , come on . # PM: Forgot to insert the minutes , but it's about the same thing we discussed before . # PM: Could open that anyway , think . # PM: Other design anyway , we took as we took w we took rubber as the material last time . # PM: We also that you're just busy with it . # PM: Took the advanced chip to t implement the advanced features . # PM: we discussed the design , no sharp corners , we rounded it off , like you see on the other screen , which is fine . # PM: we agreed that the colour should be b yellow and black . # PM: Yellow in the back because it's m trendy , more trendy than black anyway . # PM: then we ca We agreed that we would implement both the L_C_D_ and speech recognition , but I'll get to that in a moment . # PM: 'Cause some changes in the finances have left us implications anyway . # PM: like I said , we had no insight in finances , no prices , but we have 'em now , and it's bad . # PM: Prototype presentation , well first you guys built the prototype . # PM: you could present that . # PM: But let's see what be handy to do . # PM: you just go ahead and present we'll scrap it later because # ID: I think it's more or less the same as we had . # UI: It's basically what we agreed upon , but just a little bit more specified . # PM: hasn't changed that much , huh ? # ID: No no , not at all . # PM: I didn't expect anyway . # PM: You just coloured it . # UI: Final design . # UI: Basically in what we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components , as you can see right over here . # PM: I like the menu . # UI: We chose a different type of colour for the menu . A bit darker yellow so that it com really shows in this keypad . # UI: If you put them all black , it's not really that good a contrast . # PM: And I suppose the yellow is not printed on the on the rubber . It's it's part of the rubber , I suppose . # PM: I think that's more I think that's more durable anyway than printed on to # UI: That's the be And it I guess it's more easier to just paint it on the rubber # ID: That's the integration story again . # UI: So we have it's a bit round shaped , that's what we had We chose the buttons to be teletext , okay button , favourite channel and the mute . # UI: So that's basically what we chose there . # UI: If you have anything to add , please interrupt me . # ID: this is just a description of what we see there . # ID: Speaks for itself . # UI: That's pretty much it . # PM: Now it's my time to ruin everything . # PM: not ruin everything , # PM: Finances , that's what we have here , what you drew . # PM: We have battery power , we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor . The sample sensor and for speak recognition anyway . # PM: So which you see the which is de o one of the most expensive parts . # PM: So well , we have sin one curve , a design . Rubber design . # PM: And we had a special colour . Suppose yellow is a special colour . # PM: So just half a Euro for You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display . # PM: You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost , which is higher than the twelve and a half that we are permitted to use . # PM: What do we scrap . # PM: think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition . # UI: I'd say that too . # PM: Because the L_C_D_ has more support on customer side . # PM: There are ninety one percent of the people , or something like that . But ninety percent who favour an L_C_D_ display , and only sixty percent that favour speech recognition . # PM: I think it's also harder to # UI: we don't really have a extra function with the speech sample , which you can't do with a normal remote control , which people already do . # PM: I took that out . # PM: and so it's still stuck with thirteen , so I had to take out the special colour I suppose . # PM: , I didn't see anything else I could take out . # PM: I could take out the push-buttons , # PM: but we need those . # PM: So , generally what I came up with , in order to be cou to have production cost of twelve and a half Euros , spe scrap speech recognition # ME: Special colour , . # PM: and the separate covers can account for the if people want it , we'll just then we'll do it in black . # PM: We'll just deliver it in black , have the it has all the function that it's supposed to have , and if you want it if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers . # PM: You make it d orange or whatever you want . # UI: I'd I tend to disagree with you on that , because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this . # PM: It was a big issue , but # UI: So can't we just basically extend it to thirteen ? # PM: I'll just go back . # PM: let's just let's see what let's just see what we have to be under twelve and a half . # PM: It it's not the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half , # ID: but there's another problem . # ID: But there's another problem . # ID: If we take another cover , for instance black , then we also need another button frame , 'cause black and black doesn't work obviously . # PM: I think you that's what you were ass assigned to do really , to see how b th both those work together . # PM: So I think , it's I think it's y one of the it's a good way to help people to make to keep the product trendy too . # PM: Just keep you just make new covers for the for it , like we agreed before . # PM: And everything that's left is the basic function that we want our product to have . # PM: Because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip . # PM: But we need that for the L_C_D_ display . # PM: Then again , we have the L_C_D_ display , which is also expensive . # PM: but those go together . # PM: we could take out the curve . # ID: Or say let's lose rubber , take plastic . # UI: We could take out a curve indeed . # PM: we could take out the curve . # PM: Is that an option ? # ID: Although we are demolishing a little bit the style . # UI: I think the colour is more important than the really the curve , because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control # PM: I think it's it does ruin it , # PM: but the fact that I t took that decision or t Took this example actually , not really decision , but the example is because we do offer the possibility of adding your own custom covers . # PM: So you can change any colour you want . # PM: it's just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want . # ID: Can we then not also change the material ? # ID: We take plastic for the basic cover # PM: You can take plastic , but I d it's something that's stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the # ID: We can put those to the to the other covers . # PM: and it really makes it also makes it different from the existing remote controls , because they're all plastic . # PM: So which in turn # PM: Rubber would increase durability because it doesn't break . # ID: But what do you then suggest we'd lose ? # ID: Because we have to lose two things and I guess . # PM: like I said , I lost the speech recognition and I lost the special colour , which would make this black a black and grey . # ID: and that's enough ? # PM: , that's that that's enough , because # UI: So black and grey is okay . # PM: I guess those are the basic colours . # UI: Which we can fabricate , # PM: I think those are basic col They want to # ME: The people want to pay for it , so why do we have to keep us uh on the twelve and a half ? # PM: To ensure the profit . # PM: That that's th that's the order . # PM: We're just we're the project team and we got our orders from the pro from the boss of our company which say we don't wanna spend more than twelve fifty for this . # ME: But we can take a risk . # PM: But that's not for our that's not our decision to take . # PM: We have a budget of twelve fifty per product . # UI: we basically We need to stick to that . # PM: I don't think it's really bad either . I mean if we have the backup of or the backup design thing # ME: I hope the people will like it , # PM: to have I think they would do . Th I think they do like because yo we you we agree upon that the that the cover thing was a nice idea , because p you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product , one basic product which you could turn into any taste you want . # PM: I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect # ID: Perhaps we should make m # PM: and keep the functionality between of within the th the boundaries of the your f your budget . # ME: The first sheet . # ID: Perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost . # ID: And that's they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost , that they know that . # PM: I don't think Is it worth is it is it # ID: Perhaps they decide tha # UI: But they don't # PM: does it mean anything to the customer ? # PM: Like , it like , we don't care we don't care that you had to # ID: Perhaps they but perhaps they think okay , the cover is such a nice idea , let's that then they that allow us to make some more costs . # ID: We ca we can at least tell them that # PM: but we did we didn't get that . # PM: So I think it's # ID: You don't know that . # PM: it should either be a pack , maybe we sh that should be sold in the s in stores with a standard cover or something . # ID: No , I'm not talking about that cost but the one that g has given us the order to design this . # ID: We could at least m make it like this , like you said , # PM: They could , but # ID: and then tell them okay , we had to drop this and that , just that you know . It is an still an option , but not for this price . # PM: It's an option , but , it's true . # PM: So actually it's not that much of an increase , We cannot contact them . # PM: It's just the order that we got . # PM: So that's what we gotta go with . # PM: So it's either one fi just to get it f just to get it through final , it's either turned into plastic , drop the squishy feel , make it make it more breakable , or turn it yellow . # PM: It's something we have to decide on . # ID: I'd say lose the curve and the colour # PM: I say lose the curve . Oh that's true , we could lose the c I forgot that , the curve . # UI: So which curve is that # PM: That's just this one just d this is the banana curve . # UI: that's basically that curve . # PM: So this would this would be straight . # UI: So we could u still have the comfort . # ME: , that's better . # PM: that would be a curve inside the thing , I guess . # PM: would ju then it would just be a straight remote . Just like that . # PM: Which would , turn it into something far more ordinary . # PM: we could make it yellow then , # UI: I second that . # PM: You second that , you second that we lose the curve . # UI: that it would turn out to be a pretty straight-forward remote control . # UI: So that's not really that # PM: So I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve to separate it from the rest of the remote control world , so to speak . # PM: So we keep the curve . # PM: So the only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber . # PM: And I'm in favour of keeping the rubber , because it has more advantages than the colour yellow has . # UI: I would say I would agree with you on the colour , because that's an extra option , an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money . # UI: So we can always do that . # PM: I guess people are willing to pay for that . # PM: So I think we can take that option and just with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control . # PM: So I think that would still make it a nice product . # PM: we're final on that . # PM: it's too bad we can't make the whole super thing . # PM: But anyways we're here . # UI: Which is basically what we discussed . # PM: This we discussed just now . # PM: That's just now just we could just discuss how the project went . # PM: I mean , was kind of # ME: And I want to do that . # PM: I sort of expected that everything would turn out this way , but because you everything cannot be for free . # PM: We didn't I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time . # PM: Because that was I th it was really essential really # UI: we could have # PM: because we spent uh entire stage designing a product of which we had no idea what it would cost . # PM: So we just put something I think it's really nor not in stroke with reality actually . # ID: Me too , I felt a bit blind throughout the project , because in the beginning I had no list of available materials , # PM: I think would have been . # PM: Materials would be ok # ID: and then I d had not list of available c finances . # PM: at least the last meeting I would have expected had to have that . # PM: let's see if it sells . # PM: I mean I suppose this sells , because it's very extended . # UI: I hope it sells . # PM: I suppose it sells , because it's good . # PM: I mean it's got everything for the for the reasonable price , because we didn't know what it's gonna cost anyway . # ME: let's eval evaluate the product of us , our design . # ME: I have some a method , a requirements and scale of . # ME: I will pre present some statements and we will decided together wha what if it's true or false and then we see if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not . # PM: Have been met , okay . # ME: And I will make a new blank sheet So so the buttons , the look and feel . # ME: I thought it was okay , but the advanced settings , screen , audio and channel # PM: They're stuck under menu . # UI: Which are basically accessible through the menu button . # PM: I think those are totally met , because we really took them for the they have the feel they want , # ME: the menu button is it . # PM: they have the simplicity they want . # ME: Then it's all S # PM: I think it's very well met . # PM: Either two or one maybe . # PM: I think we took that everything they wanted into consideration . # PM: So it could either be a two or a one . # PM: One and a half . # UI: Which is not an option . # PM: Just create our own option . # ME: it's red , Look and feel is everybo it's true . # ME: And the next one , when it's lost you can find it . # PM: It's perfect . Even for deaf people , I don't think it's perfect , but we did everything possible to get it back . # UI: To make it that way , . # PM: Because if it's stuck in you couch , you can see the light . # PM: Maybe you can hear it . # PM: But I mean we tried , so I think it that's that deserves a one . Definitely . # ME: And it's and it's That's okay then . # ME: And the next one . # ME: How is that ? w we had we don't have an manual , # ID: I think the L_C_D_ display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control , # ME: But I think that's a part of it . # PM: I'd use an remote control . # ID: but then again , it's for young people . # ME: an L_C_D_ , it tells a lot about # UI: And it's pretty straight-forward , # PM: It's pretty straight-forward , uh-huh . # UI: you have a navigation no keys to navigate through the L_C_D_ menus . # ID: No , that's true . # ID: I think it won't be a big problem . # PM: I think but we didn't even # ME: For the advanced settings . # PM: there was no issue on making a manual actually . # PM: We didn't really discuss it , # ME: No okay , that that's true . # PM: I don't think it takes no , it really does doesn't take time to learn , I think . # PM: We took it s it's so easy , # UI: it is pretty straight-forward . # PM: we have so little button , everything speaks for itself really . # PM: So I think that's we didn't it's either two or one , I guess . # PM: Maybe it's a two , because d the L_C_D_ is a little is a little new and there is there are some option hidden under the menu button . # ID: With the more important functions on . # PM: So I might make this a two instead of a one , I guess . # ME: And the L_C_D_ , you have to see it . # PM: So just make that a two . # ME: it's a little bit learning . # ME: it's a little bit same . # ME: But it tells you or not ? # PM: You can use the L_C_D_ in a good way . # PM: I think it's perfect , the w where it is , what it can do , if it useful . # ME: But wha w What are we displaying on the L_C_D_ screen ? # ME: Just only the channels and or # ID: the menus Things like brightness and those kind of things we've put in the menu , because we have no buttons for those . # UI: basically the menu options indeed . # ME: Oh , in the L_C_D_ screen . # PM: I mean in the L_C_D_ screen , the small screen . What does it display ? # ME: And for a channel selection , or that's not # PM: I thought it was I thought it was I thought that people wanted previews on their I'm not sure if that even possible , # ME: , I thought I thought too # PM: 'cause it's this requires a quite a bit of band-width . # PM: I don't think it's possible really . # PM: But the they didn't really define in what should be used for . # ME: Maybe a T_V_ guide or something in your L_C_D_ # PM: But I think in for example like T_V_ guides , I think that's that th that you can transmit through it and everything . Just for extra information on your programmes . # ME: it must be clear then what for we use it . # PM: But also things like menus or p how about preferences of your with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example , how do you configure that . # PM: So that could be done by L_C_D_ display . # PM: I think it's good . # PM: No , maybe it's not a one because it's we're not using it perfectly . # PM: We didn't give it I don't thing over-discussing . # PM: Now we gave it enough thought though . # PM: I think we d should just lower this . # PM: Maybe maybe it's a three though . # PM: We could've used it more effectively probably . # ME: everybody's agree with an three on it , # PM: we are using it , # PM: but it's not it's not poorly used , but it's not efficiently used , I think . # PM: We could have ev even lost the selection button and done everything via L_C_D_ selection . # PM: now it's just extra to illustrate im extra features , but okay . # ID: Nah , it's not really only an extra . # UI: You can seven . # ME: , nothing , that's A seven . that's # PM: Can you talk to remote control ? # UI: Or we could say it # PM: it can't talk anymore . # PM: So we scrap that . # UI: Or we could say neutral , we 'cause we scratched the # PM: Just to be a prick , but of course you can talk to your remote control , it doesn't do anything . # PM: But you c you can talk to it . # ME: Not with the speech recognition . # ME: all the trends and no colours anymore . # PM: we did take everything into consideration of course . # PM: the shape i shape is i # ME: only in the curves . # PM: I think we I think that's okay . # ME: But the colours , we don't have special colours on it . # UI: No , we don't have the colour . # PM: special co but we took into consideration the fact that it's customisable to the fashi # UI: but the end product So # ME: we don't have it , # PM: We don't have it we do have it , # ME: In the end product . # PM: it's just sold as a package . # PM: It does it's not part of the basic product . # ID: Changing covers is also trend that we followed . # PM: It that that's what I call trendy . # PM: I mean the shape is trendy . # PM: The the sh the functions are trendy . # PM: It's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model . # PM: Because you ha it's just not affordable at the moment . # UI: Maybe we should go with a two then , # ME: But it's not a one . # UI: because it's not perfect , because we can't do it initially , # PM: It's possible , but you have to pay extra for the for the possibility of having it in a f a different colour . # ME: Oh it's a two , On the last one . # ME: that n that's all . # PM: Overall score . # UI: Overall score . # PM: One two three . sixteen . # ME: ten , sixteen three two # PM: Two two point some two point something . # ME: two point seven or something like that . # ME: I don't know why . # UI: Ten , sixteen , divided by Is two third . # PM: Two and two thirds . # ME: we can say it's the product is it's okay . # PM: It's okay , but that's yo m mostly it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition . # PM: 'Cause , that gives you a seven , which ruins your average . # PM: Without that it would be like under it wouldn't , it would be under two . # PM: So I think we have even with this it's reasonable . # UI: if we make it into a four , as in neutral , because we didn't implement it , so we can't say that we that it's really not well implemented . We come out on a average of two one eighth . # PM: I think it's two is okay . # UI: which is pretty w good . # PM: , two is pretty good . # UI: It's at least on the positive side . # UI: We could definitely have done better if we've had more resources , # PM: I think it's probably I do admit that we d did miss a little or didn't sp didn't talk enough about the possibility of the L_C_D_ display . # PM: We could have used it more efficiently , we just didn't think of it that way . # PM: like I said , changing channels , everything hidden in your L_C_D_ display , so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything . # ID: But I think for this price , this is it's really a reasonable product . # PM: I think we div I think we did very well , # ID: It's a good product . # PM: ev even if you look at this score , we did quite well . # ME: With an L_C_D_ screen . # PM: It just looking for improvements what you could have improved . # ID: But if pep people really want speech recognition , then they must be prepared to pu to pay more , because it's cannot be done for this . # PM: They sh they should get kids , and just stick 'em in T_V_ and say change the channel . # ME: you can make 'em another one . # ID: but for this price you cannot ask that . # PM: I don' think so . # PM: it's just not it it's not affordable . # ID: You cannot th think of that # PM: Or your sh you should lose the L_C_D_ screen probably , # PM: but I think that's I think the L_C_D_ screen is more worth than speech recognition . # ID: Oh It's also more attractive . # PM: that was that . # PM: So that's the final product without the speakers , I guess . # PM: Let's see , what was left in the Another one . # PM: we evaluate the product . # PM: General project , what's i in For example , I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created . # PM: We took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example , which I thought was pretty creative , because it was never ever listed somewhere . # ME: Favourite channel . # PM: Well Anyways . , leadership is up to you . # PM: I mean perhaps I screwed up because I d put a put a speech recognition into it . # PM: But that's not for me to decide . # PM: I think we did pretty well as team-work though . # PM: Because , was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime , because when I got the when I got the input for the financial results , initially of course I wanted to contact you . # ME: , you're working separate . # PM: Say , look , this is you're doing the wrong thing , you're s you're wasting your time now , because we're implementing stuff that we cannot afford . # PM: So it would be better if y if there was more communication between # ME: yeah . Direct communication with . # PM: because that's what would w you what you would normally do , either call or email someone . # UI: And we could share information which we received . # PM: So that was too bad was impossible here anyways . # ID: That's the same thing that I had in the beginning . # ID: Everybody was using materials that s I didn't have . # PM: It didn't have or didn't knew what they costs or whatever . # PM: There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them . # PM: So that was a little unclear I suppose . # PM: I think a SMARTboard is pretty cool . # PM: I think s especially for design issues , it's very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little it's easier to share them . # ME: My handwriting is little bit # UI: Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher , # PM: It's a little less it the response time is le it's very bad . # PM: It's good to visualise everything , but I think the response time should could be a lot better . # UI: The digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to further elaborate on that . # ID: But there's also one problem with this I noticed . # ID: you have to finish a page before going to a n # PM: No , you don't have to . No , you don't . # PM: I didn't check the finish button . # PM: you just ditch it and you can copy it or whatever . # ME: Done and then it's okay . # PM: only if you check the notes or press done . Then it then you can then it exports to Word automatically . # PM: But it's not necessary to check either one of those two . # PM: You can just preview your p you can just preview your page in the in the programme . # ID: but I made three pages and they were not finished . # ID: And when the third one was finished , I wanted to download it and then it was not possible anymore , because you have to close all the pinnits the pages before going further . # PM: before starting a ne a new page . # PM: Okay , that could be b . # ID: So we cannot work on more than one page at same time . That's not possible . # ID: You have to finish it completely , # UI: Oh can you ? Okay . # ID: then download it , then start a new one . # ID: That's not very handy , but if you know that , then it's not a problem . # PM: it's understandable , okay . # PM: Any new ideas ? # PM: more communication between that's the thing I noticed , that communication is very important , # ME: Important to mm # PM: because if you get new information , it's essential f for the other team-mates to know that as soon as possible , because you would avoid making doing extra work , because you were doing extra work now m working on the on the speech recognition , you have limitation both on the technical on the d on the design side . # PM: So I think that could have been better . # PM: But that's I think it's more of a setting here that you cannot communicate than somewhere else . # UI: it could also possibly be well , is it a more real-time information base , so we can all see which information is available to one another . # PM: And l less p less spam probably . # PM: I'm not sure i I'm not sure you got spammed as well , but I get spammed like every t every two minutes there was a there was another email about master classes or something . # PM: which were totally useless actually . # PM: I thought I should probably look into them , but they were all useless . # UI: I personally did not have that , # UI: That's probably your l description . # UI: But I also didn't not really . But still , you had that as well . # UI: Is that we finished up the design and then we checked the website , and then there was just extra information . # ME: after After five minutes , # UI: There was a little delay in the bit of a c crucial delay . # PM: I didn't have any more information , it's just always the same here . # PM: So that's kind of a It would change , but not for me . # PM: So I'd I had no extra information to go on that one than what you give me actually . # PM: I couldn't do any research myself or I see , that's I could have done a little extra work probably , But I was busy enough anyway . # PM: Any new ideas found ? # PM: Or is that a 'cause , it's well , probably is . # UI: How much time do we have for this anyway ? # PM: I have no clue . # PM: That's like oh,but it Should i if the project is evaluated and it was it was in b within budget , we should celebrate . # ID: bring out the beer . # PM: think that's about it . # ME: I want one for my own . # PM: I'm not sure what we should still do though t let's see all your tasks were finished , What you ha from your assistant . So let's # ID: I have no more email . # ID: My coach is being very silent now . # PM: I should I think I sh # ME: my personal coach i # PM: I still have the total report to finish up . # PM: I think we took very little time now , because we're in agreement , everything the design is okay . # PM: The one thing we missed though , we don't have a product name . # PM: How about you cook a how about you cook up a product name ? # UI: Product name . # ID: we haven't think above about that . # ID: Huh . It's better than thi I think than a serial number . # ID: Sony T_R_ something f means nothing to me . # ME: Or fruit name . # PM: oh , think of a catchy name . # PM: I'll be working on this until the beep until it beeps . # ID: Like fruit names . # ME: Fruit name or something like that . # ME: The banana remote or something . # PM: You don't want it to resemble a banana . # ME: , it's the form of it . # PM: It's not yellow anyway . # UI: The bana 'cause it's not yellow anymore . # PM: It's not yellow anymore . # UI: I was going for the R_C_ deluxe , but it's not really a catchy name or anything , it's more # ID: at least it's not something with numbers . # ID: Numbers are so meaningless to the people . # UI: Something with our company name , # UI: can we do anything with that ? # UI: Maybe there's something on the website which will help us out . # ME: Reaction , Real Reaction . # ID: Real Reaction . # UI: The reaction deluxe . # PM: Real Reaction future R_C_ . # PM: Step into the future of remote controlling your T_V_ . # UI: Is that a name or a c campaign ? # PM: that's a that's a catchy slogan . # PM: Control your remote control . # UI: The real reactor . # PM: I go for future R_C_ probably . # PM: Something like It's short f # ID: The Real Reactor , I don't find that bad at all . # PM: Real reactor ? # UI: You should write it down as a an option . # ID: Because our name is Real Reaction . # PM: That makes me think of different products than a remote control really . # PM: Real reaction in a real # UI: So that's one option . # PM: Real reactor . # PM: Didn't notice . # ID: I'm looking for things in the name . # ID: So that the first three letters are s the same . R_E_A_ . # UI: Should I write the banana down or # PM: I take f take a banana . # ME: Remote . Banana recei R_C_ . # ID: The triple R_ . Real Reaction remotes control . Triple R_ . # UI: do you mean it like # UI: You mean it like this ? # ME: Real Reaction Remote Control . R_ three C_ . Oh . # PM: No , not like that . # PM: It should be it should be longer , because it's not a product name that you f print on a box . # ID: I think triple R_ . # PM: Just write out triple , like a word triple R_C_ , triple stripe Oh . Triple dash R_ dash s C_ . # ID: Doesn't sound ? # ME: The triple R_C_ , . # ID: I think I like it like this more . # PM: Triple R_ or triple R_C_ ? # UI: Like a C_ right now or a dash in a C_ ? # ME: Triple R_ dash . # PM: How about do both ? # PM: Sure if it looks stupid . # PM: I think that the R_C_ together takes away the image of it's a triple the first the first one looks like it's a triple remote control , but it's only a single remote control . # PM: And it's especially on the triple R_ that's important . The Real Reaction Remote . # ID: I would huh . I would lose the C_ and just name it triple R_ . # UI: Is it triple R_C_s ? No . # ID: It sounds like thinking about two different things and combining it . # ME: Triple remote . # ID: I would just say triple R_s triple R_ # PM: , triple R_ , you can # UI: that's another option . # ID: That's also short , catchy . # UI: Okay , so which ones are we going to scratch definitely ? # ME: The banana . Banana . # PM: Banana remote . # UI: I say this one as well . # PM: I think we're all in agreement about the triple R_ . # PM: I think triple R_ is cool . # ME: The r triple R_ . # PM: And it looks cool when you print it in font , looks pretty cool . # UI: Triple R_ it is . # ID: did you do now ? # PM: Just like this just and you just print triple R_ , it looks doesn't look bad , it's short , it's okay . # PM: have to write my report now , I guess . # PM: we have everything . # PM: We have the product , we have the costs , we have the possibility of everything . # ME: That will not # PM: I think it's adjourned . # PM: Retire to my lair and finish the report . # PM: That was a short meeting .

Okay , goodbye . # ID: See you in a minute . # ME: I will write that one in a Word document . # PM: Could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report ? # ID: Can't we take this one ? # ID: Otherwise we have to do it all over again . # UI: I don't really know whether we can save it as a picture or no . # ID: Is it okay if I try ? Is that okay with you ? # ME: I will ask you when I need the information . # ID: I'll put it back in a minute . # ID: it has been saving something , but where to I don't know . # ID: Oh , can I say exp yes , I can . # ID: Export as J_ PEG . # ID: can I not put this wherever I wants . # ID: My document is the wrong one , huh . # UI: Network places . # ME: Ma it's maybe it's not on the network of the rest . # ID: I don't think so . # UI: I wouldn't pick that one , no . # ID: Document and settings . # ID: That means that we have to gonna draw it again . # ID: Are you gonna do that ? # ID: Yes , that's correct . # ID: Oh , it's export . # ME: Can I see scores ? # ME: , one , two threes , two then we'll overall , two points . # UI: I see you later .
