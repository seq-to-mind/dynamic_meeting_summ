The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team and then the team members participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animal and discussed why they liked the animal. [SEP] PM: but uh cats are one
The project manager discussed the project finances and selling prices. [SEP] ME: that was profiting ,
The team then discussed various features to consider in producing the remote such as gaming options , an LCD screen , and combining functionality so as to control multiple devices. [SEP] UI: Something sort of sort of
The project manager recapped the events of the previous meeting and briefed the team on some new requirements the team must follow when designing the remote. [SEP] PM: Um I'd like to if
The marketing expert presented research on consumer preferences and user requirements for remotes. [SEP] ME: th they they want it
The marketing expert also presented information regarding voice recognition and what demographic finds the feature appealing. [SEP] ME: but would they return it
The user interface designer described the technical functions of a remote and stressed the need for a user focused design. [SEP] UI: so that if you're um
The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote. [SEP] ID: Um , I dunno what
The team then discussed the option to include voice recognition , LCD , and a feature to locate a misplaced remote. The team briefly discussed who they were aiming their product to along with the idea of marketing their product to television manufacturers. [SEP] PM: that could be something that
The team also decided on some features to include in their product. [SEP] ID: I should just look at
The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. [SEP] PM: and also because of the
The industrial designer presented options for batteries , materials and shapes to use for the case , buttons , and chips. [SEP] ME: I also have a preference
The user interface designer discussed how to create an interface for an ergonomic remote which conforms to the shape and movements of the human hand , as well as an option in which users could connect their remotes to computers in order to download program settings. [SEP] UI: And you could download programs
The marketing expert discussed findings from trendwatching reports , which indicated a need for products which look fancy , are technologically innovative , are easy to use , have a fruit and vegetable theme , and are spongy. [SEP] ME: things change all the time
The team then discussed what materials and components to use , the color of the remote , and programming options for the remote. [SEP] PM: Possibly I'm think I'm not
The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented a prototype for the remote the team is designing and discussed its ergonomic appearance and its features. [SEP] UI: that you just drape over
The marketing expert began to lead the team in conducting an evaluation of the prototype but was interrupted when the project manager shifted the discussion to examining the production costs of the team's product. [SEP] PM: was that we have an
The original specifications of the team's product proved to be too expensive and so the team had to discuss which features to lose and which to maintain in order to meet the target cost. [SEP] PM: make it glow in the
After discussing costs , the team returned to conducting their product evaluation. [SEP] PM: Just to give you an
The prototype was evaluated on the basis of its ability to be located when misplaced , ease of use , appearance , technological innovativeness , and sponginess. [SEP] ID: Yeah , I'll go with
Overall , the prototype received average marks. [SEP] UI: are people really gonna shell
The team then evaluated the project process , finding that they were happy overall but quite displeased with the small budget. [SEP] ME: {vocalsound} I was actually kind
The group introduced themselves to each other. [SEP] ID: I'm Krista and I'm the
The Project Manager discussed the goals for the project and gave an agenda for the project as a whole. The group practiced using the meeting-room equipment by drawing on the whiteboard. [SEP] ME: We ought to decide who
The Project Manager presented the projected profit and price point. [SEP] ME: well it's the profit so
The group discussed their experiences with remote controls. They complained that remotes got lost too easily , and suggested using a locator function. [SEP] UI: Hand-sized .
They also complained that remotes had too many buttons , and suggested incorporating a screen to simplify the interface but retain all of the functions. [SEP] PM: I mean , we have
They also suggested making the remote water-resistant and including a clip. [SEP] PM: Maybe um just like a
The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to research the working design and components , the User Interface Designer to research the technical functions , and the Marketing Expert to research user requirements. [SEP] PM: So we'll be working on
The Marketing Expert gave a presentation about user requirements as shown through a usability study and demonstrated that only a small number of functions on a remote were used with frequency. She suggested focusing the interface design on the most frequently used functions. [SEP] ME: but I think that the
The User Interface Designer presented some questions that should be considered in making the device user-friendly and displayed two existing remote controls for comparison. [SEP] UI: uh but I mean I
The Industrial Designer discussed the necessary internal components and how they operated together , and presented her preferences for the type of each component to be used. [SEP] ID: and I'd probably say a
The Project Manager gave the group several new requirements for the project. [SEP] PM: Um and also we need
The group discussed several product features and decided that the remote will feature a locator function and will not feature speech recognition. [SEP] PM: like um if you can
The group discussed whether or not the remote should control multiple devices. [SEP] PM: And and if we're if
They discussed important button functions to include and increasing usability by incorporating a scroll wheel in the design. [SEP] UI: but then if uh if
The Project Manager instructed the other participants to fill out a questionnaire and to work on their individual presentations for the next meeting. [SEP] ID: I don't think it's the
The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting. [SEP] PM: Um , then we considered
The Industrial Designer gave her presentation on components and discussed which would have to be custom-made and which were standard. She also discussed the various materials and chips available. [SEP] ID: Um and also we should
The Marketing Expert presented current trends in the market and in fashion. She discussed the current fruits and vegetables trend and the trend toward softer , spongier materials. [SEP] ME: should we print the fruit
The User Interface Designer discussed the look of the remote with the group. They discussed including a touch-based graphical user interface but noted that it was unnecessary and costly. They discussed using the menu function on the television instead. The group discussed how the menu function would be programmed. The group then talked about the casing of the device , and decided that there would be a changeable outer casing. [SEP] ID: I believe it's ins it's
Some part of the casing will be made of a spongy material. They discussed including fruit colors in addition to the company colors. [SEP] ID: I guess they would be
The group also discussed energy source options and chips. [SEP] ID: Like the chip is probably
The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype and the Marketing Expert to work on the prototype evaluation. [SEP] ID: Like the chip is probably
The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the last meeting. [SEP] PM: Um and we also talked
The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented the prototype and displayed the changeable fruit- and vegetable-shaped covers. [SEP] UI: It's been a little bit
They discussed the locator function that will be designed at a later time. [SEP] UI: Yeah that c hey that
The Project Manager discussed the final production cost for the device , which totaled 11.9 Euros. [SEP] PM: which is even less than
The Marketing Expert led an evaluation of the prototype. Each participant rated the prototype according to the original criteria for the project. [SEP] ID: I thought it was the
The group discussed the areas in which the prototype did not meet these goals. The group felt that the changeable fruit and vegetable shapes were uncomfortable to hold. [SEP] UI: although the broccoli is quite
The group decided to make changeable covers in fruit colors and designs and to use one uniform shape. [SEP] ID: I bet having different colours
The group discussed their experience on the project. They felt they worked well together and were creative. They complained that the meeting-room materials were difficult to use , and some complained that there was not enough information provided to them. [SEP] ID: They're kinda hard to write
The Project Manager instructed all participants to write a final report at the end of the meeting. [SEP] PM: Hmm . Or is that
The group introduced themselves to each other and discussed their roles in the project. [SEP] ME: Marketing is uh , is
The Project Manager opened a discussion about the project plan and asked the Marketing Expert to prepare an overall plan for the project. [SEP] PM: so there's any questions or
The Marketing Expert presented the initial aim of the project: the creation of a fresh , user-friendly remote control device. [SEP] ME: 'cause a lot of times
The Project Manager asked the Industrial Designer to create a functional design plan for the device , then asked the Marketing Expert about ideas for the sales strategy. [SEP] PM: and d do you have
The Marketing Expert presented an initial sales plan: to analyze the competition and to pinpoint the target marketing group. [SEP] ME: and then it's gotta be
The Project Manager instructed all participants to work together on their respective design plans. [SEP] PM: But what I request ,
The Project Manager decided that the design plans will be discussed at the next meeting , and that the next step will be to come up with a functional design of the device. [SEP] PM: And if anything you need
The Project Manager gave new requirements for the product: the remote will not include a teletext function , will only be used for television , and must show the corporate image. [SEP] PM: And the third point ,
The Industrial Designer presented  possible components to consider. The group then discussed hard materials to include in the design. [SEP] ID: It'd be hard to inflate
The Marketing Expert presented an initial sales plan and showed that there is a demand for remotes featuring voice recognition and other capabilities; the group discussed how it could be integrated into the functional design. [SEP] ME: I don't think it would
The Project Manager offered to help the Industrial Designer find companies to provide help in integrating this component. [SEP] PM: we need to know how
The designers expressed that they needed more information from the board on their expectations for the product. [SEP] PM: And uh I hope I
The User Interface Designer gave a presentation on product design from the user's perspective and emphasized simplicity in design. [SEP] PM: and to add some features
The user interface designer also suggested that the group make a decision on which features to include in the final product design , but the group decided to postpone it. The designers were given their assignments: the Marketing Expert will present the marketing concept; the User Interface Designer , the user interface concept; the Industrial Designer , the components concept. [SEP] ID: 'cause w our meeting time
The Industrial Designer gave her components concept presentation , which presented the components that will be used and how they will be integrated into the functional design. She announced that their only choice for casing material was wood , so she suggested an idea of having customizable wood cases. [SEP] UI: have to see how kid-friendly
The User Interface Designer gave her presentation on the user interface concept for the product , and gave a basic layout of the remote's key functions. [SEP] UI: So once we decide exactly
The Marketing Expert presented the marketing concept and discussed including a display to facilitate use. [SEP] UI: Especially you might need something
The group discussed the unique , custom design of the remote , and quickly talked about finding a manufacturer that could make the custom cases cheaply that still paid fair wages. [SEP] PM: but uh le let's decide
The group also discussed whether or not to incorporate the display into the design , and decided to wait until the cost of adding that feature was known before adding it to the design. [SEP] PM: until uh th Ed find
The Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer were instructed to begin building a prototype , and the Marketing Expert was instructed to work on the marketing strategy as well as research the cost of the display component. [SEP] PM: then uh , then we
The User Interface Designer presented the prototype of the product to the group. The product featured an LCD display , a flip panel , and a customizable case back. [SEP] ME: Now it goes into this
The Project Manager displayed the cost of all of the components , and the group decided that the current budget would not allow the addition of the LCD display. [SEP] ID: Uh you got some pretty
The Project Manager decided to negotiate the cost of production to allow the addition of the display. [SEP] PM: I will speak to the
The Marketing Expert gave a presentation on sales projection and showed that the current projected sales point would probably not allow the project to reach its profit aim. [SEP] ME: Can it sell it for
The group also discussed the distribution and promotion of the product on the internet. [SEP] PM: I don't think that's uh
The User Interface Designer expressed concern that there would not be time under the current plan to make changes to the product resulting from consumer testing; the Project Manager decided that no additional changes would be made. The group then discussed other means of promoting the product: launching the remote at the same time as a large sporting event or DVD release. [SEP] ID: so , you're right ,
The Project Manager introduced himself and the project to the group. [SEP] PM: it has to be original
The project manager presented an agenda for the rest of the project. [SEP] PM: it's exactly how it looks
The group acquainted themselves with the meeting-room materials by drawing on the board. [SEP] PM: Now we just have to
The Project Manager discussed the projected price point , profit aim , and production cost for the project. The group discussed their initial ideas about the product design. [SEP] ME: Because we sell it uh
They decided to make the remote a universal remote. [SEP] PM: so a lot of buttons
They discussed the form of the device; it was suggested that the device could have a folding-open design or a touch-screen interface. [SEP] PM: You can put games on
They discussed energy source options and could not decide between using standard batteries or a recharging stand. [SEP] PM: The option , just the
They also discussed how to make the remote look more unique; it was suggested that the remote could feature the folding-open design to hide complicated functions on the inside of the device. [SEP] PM: Just think about it .
The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to prepare the user requirement specification and to research which devices the remote will control. [SEP] PM: uh what kind of uh
The Project Manager announced that the remote should only control television , and that the marketing should be targeted towards ages 40 and above. The Marketing Expert presented the results of a lab study on users of remote controls , and showed that users want a fancier , less complicated remote that does not get lost easily. The group decided not to use speech recognition or an LCD screen to target the older demographic. [SEP] UI: So make it just a
The User Interface Designer discussed the button functions and how to make channel-changing easier. The group decided not to include programmable "favorites" buttons. [SEP] UI: But uh well , I
The Industrial Designer presented the internal components of the device. The group discussed having the remote light up when used. He also stressed that the remote must be compatible with all television brands. [SEP] PM: Yeah , that's a good
The Project Manager corrected his target group announcement and announced that the target age group was actually ages 40 and below. [SEP] UI: to make it more like
The group again discussed the possibility of adding speech recognition and LCD screens to the design but decided that it was not feasible. [SEP] ME: Okay , no speech recognition
The group decided to have the remote light up when used and is including teletext. The Marketing Expert was instructed to report on trendwatching. [SEP] PM: you know what you have
The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting. [SEP] PM: And the functions are volume
The Marketing Expert gave a trendwatching report. He found that a fancy look and feel was most important for users. He also discussed the trend towards spongy materials. [SEP] ME: We ma must have some
The group discussed the cost of adding speech recognition , the LCD screen , and the advanced chip. [SEP] ID: I I haven't got anything
The User Interface Designer discussed the look of the interface with the group. They discussed the placement and design of the buttons and decided to use scroll wheels for volume. [SEP] UI: if you put in uh
The Industrial Designer advised that flashy colors and rounded shapes be used. [SEP] ID: And um sports and gaming
The group discussed how to incorporate the logo and including changeable faces. [SEP] ID: but y you could you
They discussed materials for the buttons and the backlight. The group decided to use rechargeable batteries and a stand , to use plastic for the casing and buttons , and to not include an LCD screen. [SEP] PM: And we need a plastic
The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer were instructed to draw the prototype at the next meeting , and the User Interface Designer was instructed to finalize the button placement. The group finalized the look of the product , and eventually decided to incorporate speech recognition and an advanced chip. [SEP] PM: Yeah , five . Let's
The project manager presented the agenda and the minutes from the previous meeting. [SEP] PM: If anything doesn't look right
The group discussed speech recognition  , whether the remote should slide open or fold open , and what type of chip they should use. [SEP] PM: So I already calculated that
The designers presented the prototype , which resembles an ipod in appearance , and is made of transparent coloured plastic. The colours will be changeable. The remote has both buttons and a scroll wheel. [SEP] UI: And also in the num-pads
The number buttons have a back-light. [SEP] UI: And also in the num-pads
The group discussed adding extra buttons/functions. [SEP] ID: uh the remote can send
The prototype was evaluated and received an average overall score of 1.8. [SEP] ME: A perfect score . {vocalsound}
The project manager went through the finances , and the total cost came to 12.3 euros , although this did not include the cost of the recharger , which was not on the price list. [SEP] UI: Is that uh included ?
The group evaluated the project process , and were generally pleased with their creativity and teamwork , but were unsatisfied with the equipment. [SEP] UI: Yeah , this this is
When the meeting begins the project manager lists the agenda and then describes the project , which is to develop a new remote control that is original , trendy , and user-friendly. [SEP] PM: And at the end of
The group practices using the smart board by choosing an animal to draw and then explaining why they picked it. [SEP] ID: {vocalsound} It's a cat .
The project manager goes over the product budget and they proceed to have discussion. [SEP] PM: Uh I'm taking notes .
They each identify their individual tasks during each phase based on their role in the group. They briefly discuss characteristics of a desirable remote , including medium size buttons , small unit , and work within a good zapping range. [SEP] PM: and put it in the
The team again discusses their individual responsibilities and move on to ponder whether the remote will be multifunctional or only for the TV. [SEP] ID: So if I don't know
They decide to first assume it is only for TV and video , but allowing the possibility to add more features. [SEP] PM: {vocalsound} Th the least amount
They close the meeting upon establishing what each person will do. [SEP] PM: Let's see what we got
The marketing expert reported on research which shows that users think most remotes are ugly , easily lost and bad for RSI. [SEP] ME: Um {vocalsound} they do not
Audio settings are rarely used , and the power , channel and volume buttons are used most often. [SEP] ME: but we can skip that
The marketing expert and project manager described the new requirements that the target group is users under 40 , the remote should not include teletext , should be only for TV , and should feature the corporate logo. The remote should be user-friendly and have a good look and feel. The user interface designer showed examples of two contrasting remotes , recommending that they should use the best features of both. The group decided to use an LCD screen and speech recognition. [SEP] UI: So we have to make
The industrial designer described how a remote works , and explained that his presentation was incomplete because he had not received the necessary information in time. [SEP] ID: and the T_V_ will translate
The group discussed what functions to include and the layout of the remote , and the marketing expert drew a possible design on the board. They decided to have buttons for the basic functions and make the advanced functions accessible through the screen. They also discussed what buttons would be needed to navigate the menu on the LCD screen. [SEP] ME: Yeah a audio settings ,
The marketing expert talked about trendwatching and explained that the current trends are for fruit and vegetable themed products and products with a spongy texture. For users , the three most important aspects of a remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , and ease of use. The industrial designer talked about the options for energy source , case shape and material , and internal components. [SEP] ID: So uh w single curved
The user interface designer talked about speech recognition and what functions will be controlled through buttons or the lcd screen menu. [SEP] UI: And uh if there are
The group decided on using kinetic energy , and a double-curved rubber case. [SEP] ME: Rubber material .
The project manager ran through the group's decisions so far and led a discussion of their remaining options , including the colour of the case and buttons , and whether the remote should flip open or not. [SEP] ID: what we should do I
The project manager decided to start by looking at costs instead of the prototype presentation because the original design was too expensive and had to be changed. [SEP] PM: Okay , so we're at
The group discussed which features should be dropped. They decided to drop all the buttons in favour of an integrated scroll push-button , and to use a hand dynamo instead of kinetic energy as a power source. The group decided that the LCD screen was integral to their design , but dropped the speech recognition. [SEP] ME: Okay . Make it a
The marketing expert led the prototype evaluation , based on the new design. [SEP] ME: makes three point one one
The group were satisfied with the overall score of 3.1. [SEP] PM: So we're better than average
The industrial designer and user interface designer worked on a drawing of the new design , while the project manager and marketing manager worked on the final report. [SEP] ME: But it's it's better to
The project manager led an evaluation of the project process. The group thought that they worked well together , especially after the first meeting. They were happy with the room for creativity , but thought they were limited by the budget. They preferred the digital pens to the SMARTboard .  They had mixed feelings about using PowerPoint. [SEP] ME: Yeah . But it it's
