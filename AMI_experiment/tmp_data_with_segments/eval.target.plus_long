The team members introduced themselves to each other by name and by their roles in the project. [SEP] PM: And you're going to be
The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team and then the team members participated in an exercise in which they drew their favorite animal and discussed why they liked the animal. The team will decide how the user interface will work The remote will sell for 25 Euro. [SEP] PM: but uh cats are one
The project manager discussed the project finances and selling prices. [SEP] ME: that was profiting ,
The team then discussed various features to consider in producing the remote such as gaming options , an LCD screen , and combining functionality so as to control multiple devices. The remote will feature an ergonomic design. Putting an LCD screen on the remote. Having a remote that controls multiple devices. Having a joystick on the remote. [SEP] UI: Something sort of sort of
The project manager recapped the events of the previous meeting and briefed the team on some new requirements the team must follow when designing the remote. The team will not work with teletext. The corporate image must be recognizable on the remote. [SEP] PM: Um I'd like to if
The marketing expert presented research on consumer preferences and user requirements for remotes. [SEP] ME: th they they want it
The marketing expert also presented information regarding voice recognition and what demographic finds the feature appealing. The remote will only control televisions. The remote will have LCD. Whether to include voice recognition as a feature on the remote. What sort of components are necessary for the feature which allows the user to locate a misplaced remote. [SEP] ME: but would they return it
The user interface designer described the technical functions of a remote and stressed the need for a user focused design. What functions the joystick controls. What functions the LCD controls. [SEP] UI: so that if you're um
The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote. The remote will have a power button. [SEP] ID: Um , I dunno what
The team then discussed the option to include voice recognition , LCD , and a feature to locate a misplaced remote. The team briefly discussed who they were aiming their product to along with the idea of marketing their product to television manufacturers. The remote will have a small joystick. The remote will have a menu button. Instead of an "okay" button , the user will push down on the joystick. The remote will have a beeping noise which goes off when a user is trying to locate it. Having a remote which controls multiple devices. [SEP] PM: that could be something that
The team also decided on some features to include in their product. [SEP] ID: I should just look at
The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. [SEP] PM: and also because of the
The industrial designer presented options for batteries , materials and shapes to use for the case , buttons , and chips. The remote will have a double curved design. The remote will have a case made of rubber. [SEP] ME: I also have a preference
The user interface designer discussed how to create an interface for an ergonomic remote which conforms to the shape and movements of the human hand , as well as an option in which users could connect their remotes to computers in order to download program settings. [SEP] UI: And you could download programs
The marketing expert discussed findings from trendwatching reports , which indicated a need for products which look fancy , are technologically innovative , are easy to use , have a fruit and vegetable theme , and are spongy. [SEP] ME: things change all the time
The team then discussed what materials and components to use , the color of the remote , and programming options for the remote. The industrial designer and user interface designer will work on a prototype. The marketing expert will work on a product evaluation The remote will use a lithium battery. The remote will be yellow. Having a feature on the remote which allows the user to use a computer to program the remote according to the television model he owns. Where to place the company slogan on the remote. [SEP] PM: Possibly I'm think I'm not
The project manager recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting and two team members presented a prototype for the remote the team is designing and discussed its ergonomic appearance and its features. The remote will feature an LCD. [SEP] UI: that you just drape over
The marketing expert began to lead the team in conducting an evaluation of the prototype but was interrupted when the project manager shifted the discussion to examining the production costs of the team's product. [SEP] PM: was that we have an
The original specifications of the team's product proved to be too expensive and so the team had to discuss which features to lose and which to maintain in order to meet the target cost. The case for the remote will be single curved. The remote will be designed in a special color. The remote will be made of plastic instead of rubber. Meeting the target cost. Whether to keep the LCD. Whether to have a double curved or single curved case. [SEP] PM: make it glow in the
After discussing costs , the team returned to conducting their product evaluation. [SEP] PM: Just to give you an
The prototype was evaluated on the basis of its ability to be located when misplaced , ease of use , appearance , technological innovativeness , and sponginess. [SEP] ID: Yeah , I'll go with
Overall , the prototype received average marks. [SEP] UI: are people really gonna shell
The team then evaluated the project process , finding that they were happy overall but quite displeased with the small budget. [SEP] ME: {vocalsound} I was actually kind
The group introduced themselves to each other. [SEP] ID: I'm Krista and I'm the
The Project Manager discussed the goals for the project and gave an agenda for the project as a whole. The group practiced using the meeting-room equipment by drawing on the whiteboard. [SEP] ME: We ought to decide who
The Project Manager presented the projected profit and price point. [SEP] ME: well it's the profit so
The group discussed their experiences with remote controls. They complained that remotes got lost too easily , and suggested using a locator function. [SEP] UI: Hand-sized .
They also complained that remotes had too many buttons , and suggested incorporating a screen to simplify the interface but retain all of the functions. [SEP] PM: I mean , we have
They also suggested making the remote water-resistant and including a clip. [SEP] PM: Maybe um just like a
The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to research the working design and components , the User Interface Designer to research the technical functions , and the Marketing Expert to research user requirements. The Industrial Designer will research the working design and components. The User Interface Designer will research the technical functions. The Marketing Expert will research user requirements. [SEP] PM: So we'll be working on
The Marketing Expert gave a presentation about user requirements as shown through a usability study and demonstrated that only a small number of functions on a remote were used with frequency. She suggested focusing the interface design on the most frequently used functions. The group decided that the locator function eliminated the need for this component. The new requirements from the management regarding use with multiple devices were unclear. [SEP] ME: but I think that the
The User Interface Designer presented some questions that should be considered in making the device user-friendly and displayed two existing remote controls for comparison. The main interface will include a scroll wheel function in place of a number pad. [SEP] UI: uh but I mean I
The Industrial Designer discussed the necessary internal components and how they operated together , and presented her preferences for the type of each component to be used. All participants will fill out a questionnaire after the meeting. A locator device separate from the remote will be incorporated into the design , which will operate with radio signal. There will not be a stand in which the remote is placed when not in use. The main interface will include a power button. [SEP] ID: and I'd probably say a
The Project Manager gave the group several new requirements for the project. [SEP] PM: Um and also we need
The group discussed several product features and decided that the remote will feature a locator function and will not feature speech recognition. Speech recognition will not be used. The group decided that their target marketing group would be mostly teenagers and young professionals. [SEP] PM: like um if you can
The group discussed whether or not the remote should control multiple devices. [SEP] PM: And and if we're if
They discussed important button functions to include and increasing usability by incorporating a scroll wheel in the design. [SEP] UI: but then if uh if
The Project Manager instructed the other participants to fill out a questionnaire and to work on their individual presentations for the next meeting. [SEP] ID: I don't think it's the
The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting. [SEP] PM: Um , then we considered
The Industrial Designer gave her presentation on components and discussed which would have to be custom-made and which were standard. She also discussed the various materials and chips available. The group wanted to include a changeable outer casing but could not decide whether the spongy or the hard plastic component should be the removable casing. [SEP] ID: Um and also we should
The Marketing Expert presented current trends in the market and in fashion. She discussed the current fruits and vegetables trend and the trend toward softer , spongier materials. The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype. The User Interface Designer will work on the interface and the Industrial Designer will work on the look and feel of the device. The remote will feature a spongy material. The fruits and vegetables trend will be incorporated into the design by including fruit colors along with the company colors. [SEP] ME: should we print the fruit
The User Interface Designer discussed the look of the remote with the group. They discussed including a touch-based graphical user interface but noted that it was unnecessary and costly. They discussed using the menu function on the television instead. The group discussed how the menu function would be programmed. The group then talked about the casing of the device , and decided that there would be a changeable outer casing. [SEP] ID: I believe it's ins it's
Some part of the casing will be made of a spongy material. They discussed including fruit colors in addition to the company colors. There was a lack of information on the cost of several components. [SEP] ID: I guess they would be
The group also discussed energy source options and chips. [SEP] ID: Like the chip is probably
The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype and the Marketing Expert to work on the prototype evaluation. [SEP] ID: Like the chip is probably
The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the last meeting. [SEP] PM: Um and we also talked
The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented the prototype and displayed the changeable fruit- and vegetable-shaped covers. They complained that the meeting-room equipment was difficult to use. [SEP] UI: It's been a little bit
They discussed the locator function that will be designed at a later time. [SEP] UI: Yeah that c hey that
The Project Manager discussed the final production cost for the device , which totaled 11.9 Euros. [SEP] PM: which is even less than
The Marketing Expert led an evaluation of the prototype. Each participant rated the prototype according to the original criteria for the project. All participants will write a final report. [SEP] ID: I thought it was the
The group discussed the areas in which the prototype did not meet these goals. The group felt that the changeable fruit and vegetable shapes were uncomfortable to hold. Some participants complained that there was not enough information provided to them. [SEP] UI: although the broccoli is quite
The group decided to make changeable covers in fruit colors and designs and to use one uniform shape. The group decided that the fruit and vegetable shapes of the device were uncomfortable to hold. They decided to produce the device in one uniform shape , with changeable covers in fruit colors and designs. The group felt that the fruit and vegetable shapes of the remote were uncomfortable to hold. [SEP] ID: I bet having different colours
The group discussed their experience on the project. They felt they worked well together and were creative. They complained that the meeting-room materials were difficult to use , and some complained that there was not enough information provided to them. The group decided that the final production cost and all of the other initial goals were met sufficiently to be able to continue with the project. [SEP] ID: They're kinda hard to write
The Project Manager instructed all participants to write a final report at the end of the meeting. [SEP] PM: Hmm . Or is that
The group introduced themselves to each other and discussed their roles in the project. The User Interface Designer will contribute studies on user requirements to the functional design. The Project Manager will post his presentation to be available for all participants. The group did not receive sufficient information about the project in advance to be prepared to create a project plan in the first meeting. [SEP] ME: Marketing is uh , is
The Project Manager opened a discussion about the project plan and asked the Marketing Expert to prepare an overall plan for the project. The Marketing Expert will prepare a sales plan for the product and discuss the project budget and the sales strategy. The group will first work on a functional design of the device. [SEP] PM: so there's any questions or
The Marketing Expert presented the initial aim of the project: the creation of a fresh , user-friendly remote control device. [SEP] ME: 'cause a lot of times
The Project Manager asked the Industrial Designer to create a functional design plan for the device , then asked the Marketing Expert about ideas for the sales strategy. The Industrial Designer will prepare an initial functional design. [SEP] PM: and d do you have
The Marketing Expert presented an initial sales plan: to analyze the competition and to pinpoint the target marketing group. [SEP] ME: and then it's gotta be
The Project Manager instructed all participants to work together on their respective design plans. The group will discuss the design plans of the three experts at the next meeting. [SEP] PM: But what I request ,
The Project Manager decided that the design plans will be discussed at the next meeting , and that the next step will be to come up with a functional design of the device. [SEP] PM: And if anything you need
The Project Manager gave new requirements for the product: the remote will not include a teletext function , will only be used for television , and must show the corporate image. [SEP] PM: And the third point ,
The Industrial Designer presented  possible components to consider. The group then discussed hard materials to include in the design. The Industrial Designer will make a presentation on the components concept for the product. The User Interface Designer will make a presentation on the user interface concept. The Marketing Expert will present the marketing concept. The group will discuss which features to include in and eliminate from the final design of the product at the next meeting. [SEP] ID: It'd be hard to inflate
The Marketing Expert presented an initial sales plan and showed that there is a demand for remotes featuring voice recognition and other capabilities; the group discussed how it could be integrated into the functional design. [SEP] ME: I don't think it would
The Project Manager offered to help the Industrial Designer find companies to provide help in integrating this component. [SEP] PM: we need to know how
The designers expressed that they needed more information from the board on their expectations for the product. [SEP] PM: And uh I hope I
The User Interface Designer gave a presentation on product design from the user's perspective and emphasized simplicity in design. The Project Manager will research companies that can provide the Industrial Designer with help on integrating voice recognition into her design. The remote will have a slim shape and a simple interface , include a locator function and voice recognition , and be made of a hard material. There was a lack of sufficient information from the board on their expectations for the design of the remote , whether they expected a simple device or a more costly one with many features. [SEP] PM: and to add some features
The user interface designer also suggested that the group make a decision on which features to include in the final product design , but the group decided to postpone it. The designers were given their assignments: the Marketing Expert will present the marketing concept; the User Interface Designer , the user interface concept; the Industrial Designer , the components concept. The group was not sure whether to proceed in the design process with all of the desired functions and eliminate them later , or to eliminate some features before creating the design concept. [SEP] ID: 'cause w our meeting time
The Industrial Designer gave her components concept presentation , which presented the components that will be used and how they will be integrated into the functional design. She announced that their only choice for casing material was wood , so she suggested an idea of having customizable wood cases. The number of options for the material used for the casing was restricted; the group was left with one material that could be used for the product. There was a lack of information on how much certain components would cost. [SEP] UI: have to see how kid-friendly
The User Interface Designer gave her presentation on the user interface concept for the product , and gave a basic layout of the remote's key functions. The Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer will design the prototype of the remote control. The group decided on the features that will be included in the final design of the prototype. The remote will have customized wood casing and ergonomic sizing , voice recognition , a locator function , rubber buttons in a simple arrangement , an advanced chip , and a battery life indicator. [SEP] UI: So once we decide exactly
The Marketing Expert presented the marketing concept and discussed including a display to facilitate use. [SEP] UI: Especially you might need something
The group discussed the unique , custom design of the remote , and quickly talked about finding a manufacturer that could make the custom cases cheaply that still paid fair wages. [SEP] PM: but uh le let's decide
The group also discussed whether or not to incorporate the display into the design , and decided to wait until the cost of adding that feature was known before adding it to the design. The group discussed including a display on the remote , but the prototype will be designed without a display until the Marketing Expert finds out how much it would cost to add it. [SEP] PM: until uh th Ed find
The Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer were instructed to begin building a prototype , and the Marketing Expert was instructed to work on the marketing strategy as well as research the cost of the display component. The Marketing Expert will find out how much the display component costs and will present his marketing strategy at the next meeting. [SEP] PM: then uh , then we
The User Interface Designer presented the prototype of the product to the group. The product featured an LCD display , a flip panel , and a customizable case back. The group decided that the LCD display will be included in the design and that the microphone for the remote will be placed on the side of the device. The Project Manager decided to negotiate the cost of production to allow the integration of the display into the design. The Project Manager decided that no additional changes will be made to the remote. The product evaluation will occur at a later time , after the production of some real units have been produced , rather than evaluating the prototype. [SEP] ME: Now it goes into this
The Project Manager displayed the cost of all of the components , and the group decided that the current budget would not allow the addition of the LCD display. The Marketing Expert will begin his marketing plan after production has begun. The group will have to make many changes to their original budget plans after the final cost analysis showed that their current budget would not cover the cost of all components and that the current price point would not meet the expected profit goal. [SEP] ID: Uh you got some pretty
The Project Manager decided to negotiate the cost of production to allow the addition of the display. [SEP] PM: I will speak to the
The Marketing Expert gave a presentation on sales projection and showed that the current projected sales point would probably not allow the project to reach its profit aim. The Project Manager will negotiate with production companies and with management to decrease the cost of production. [SEP] ME: Can it sell it for
The group also discussed the distribution and promotion of the product on the internet. The group will evaluate the product after real units have been produced. [SEP] PM: I don't think that's uh
The User Interface Designer expressed concern that there would not be time under the current plan to make changes to the product resulting from consumer testing; the Project Manager decided that no additional changes would be made. The group then discussed other means of promoting the product: launching the remote at the same time as a large sporting event or DVD release. He will also present the new promotion plan to management. The group will work with other companies to promote the product and have it released along with other products or with an event , such as a sporting event. The group had problems agreeing on the project agenda , if more or less time should have been alotted for user testing and making changes to the design. [SEP] ID: so , you're right ,
The Project Manager introduced himself and the project to the group. [SEP] PM: it has to be original
The project manager presented an agenda for the rest of the project. [SEP] PM: it's exactly how it looks
The group acquainted themselves with the meeting-room materials by drawing on the board. [SEP] PM: Now we just have to
The Project Manager discussed the projected price point , profit aim , and production cost for the project. The group discussed their initial ideas about the product design. The group decided to make the remote a universal remote. [SEP] ME: Because we sell it uh
They decided to make the remote a universal remote. [SEP] PM: so a lot of buttons
They discussed the form of the device; it was suggested that the device could have a folding-open design or a touch-screen interface. [SEP] PM: You can put games on
They discussed energy source options and could not decide between using standard batteries or a recharging stand. [SEP] PM: The option , just the
They also discussed how to make the remote look more unique; it was suggested that the remote could feature the folding-open design to hide complicated functions on the inside of the device. The group discussed ways in which they could make the remote look unique but could not decide if the remote should have a unique folding-open design or if it should be made in a more standard , square shape. [SEP] PM: Just think about it .
The Project Manager instructed the Marketing Expert to prepare the user requirement specification and to research which devices the remote will control. The Marketing Expert will present the user requirement specification and will research which devices the remote will control. [SEP] PM: uh what kind of uh
The Project Manager announced that the remote should only control television , and that the marketing should be targeted towards ages 40 and above. The Marketing Expert presented the results of a lab study on users of remote controls , and showed that users want a fancier , less complicated remote that does not get lost easily. The group decided not to use speech recognition or an LCD screen to target the older demographic. The Marketing Expert will prepare a report on trendwatching. The remote will not feature speech recognition or an LCD screen. Complicated features will be hidden from the more simple functions on the main interface. The remote will feature teletext capabilities , and the teletext buttons will be included on the main interface. The new requirement that the remote was only to control television forced the group to change some of their initial design ideas. The group did not reach a decision on how to ensure that the remote would recognize all brands of televisions. [SEP] UI: So make it just a
The User Interface Designer discussed the button functions and how to make channel-changing easier. The group decided not to include programmable "favorites" buttons. [SEP] UI: But uh well , I
The Industrial Designer presented the internal components of the device. The group discussed having the remote light up when used. He also stressed that the remote must be compatible with all television brands. The remote will light up when a button is pressed , much like a mobile phone. [SEP] PM: Yeah , that's a good
The Project Manager corrected his target group announcement and announced that the target age group was actually ages 40 and below. [SEP] UI: to make it more like
The group again discussed the possibility of adding speech recognition and LCD screens to the design but decided that it was not feasible. [SEP] ME: Okay , no speech recognition
The group decided to have the remote light up when used and is including teletext. The Marketing Expert was instructed to report on trendwatching. [SEP] PM: you know what you have
The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the previous meeting. [SEP] PM: And the functions are volume
The Marketing Expert gave a trendwatching report. He found that a fancy look and feel was most important for users. He also discussed the trend towards spongy materials. The group decided to use a scroll button for volume control. The group decided to design five changeable faces for the device. The group had difficulties deciding on the placement of the buttons , the shape of the device , and whether or not to include speech recognition. [SEP] ME: We ma must have some
The group discussed the cost of adding speech recognition , the LCD screen , and the advanced chip. They eventually decided to incorporate speech recognition and an advanced chip. [SEP] ID: I I haven't got anything
The User Interface Designer discussed the look of the interface with the group. They discussed the placement and design of the buttons and decided to use scroll wheels for volume. The remote will feature plastic buttons and casing , rather than rubber. [SEP] UI: if you put in uh
The Industrial Designer advised that flashy colors and rounded shapes be used. [SEP] ID: And um sports and gaming
The group discussed how to incorporate the logo and including changeable faces. It will be small and yellow , to use one of the colors of the Real Reaction logo. [SEP] ID: but y you could you
They discussed materials for the buttons and the backlight. The group decided to use rechargeable batteries and a stand , to use plastic for the casing and buttons , and to not include an LCD screen. The User Interface Designer was instructed to finalize the placement of the buttons. The remote will include rechargeable batteries and will be used with a recharging stand. The remote will not feature an LCD screen. The remote will feature a double-curved , rounded square design. [SEP] PM: And we need a plastic
The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer were instructed to draw the prototype at the next meeting , and the User Interface Designer was instructed to finalize the button placement. The group finalized the look of the product , and eventually decided to incorporate speech recognition and an advanced chip. The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer will draw the prototype design on the smartboard at the next meeting. [SEP] PM: Yeah , five . Let's
The project manager presented the agenda and the minutes from the previous meeting. [SEP] PM: If anything doesn't look right
The group discussed speech recognition  , whether the remote should slide open or fold open , and what type of chip they should use. [SEP] PM: So I already calculated that
The designers presented the prototype , which resembles an ipod in appearance , and is made of transparent coloured plastic. The colours will be changeable. The remote has both buttons and a scroll wheel. The designers had not included the slide-out second level in their drawing of the prototype. [SEP] UI: And also in the num-pads
The number buttons have a back-light. [SEP] UI: And also in the num-pads
The group discussed adding extra buttons/functions. The remote will include buttons and a scroll wheel. The remote control will feature speech recognition and a slide-out second level. [SEP] ID: uh the remote can send
The prototype was evaluated and received an average overall score of 1.8. The group have to fill out a final questionnaire. The remote will be made of hard , transparent coloured plastic , and will come in different colours. The group were unsure how many extra buttons would be needed for speech recognition. The group felt the information they got was not always useful , or was not given to them at the right time. [SEP] ME: A perfect score . {vocalsound}
The project manager went through the finances , and the total cost came to 12.3 euros , although this did not include the cost of the recharger , which was not on the price list. [SEP] UI: Is that uh included ?
The group evaluated the project process , and were generally pleased with their creativity and teamwork , but were unsatisfied with the equipment. It was felt that the group should have received the information about costs before designing the prototype. The group had problems with the smart board and digital pens. [SEP] UI: Yeah , this this is
When the meeting begins the project manager lists the agenda and then describes the project , which is to develop a new remote control that is original , trendy , and user-friendly. [SEP] PM: And at the end of
The group practices using the smart board by choosing an animal to draw and then explaining why they picked it. [SEP] ID: {vocalsound} It's a cat .
The project manager goes over the product budget and they proceed to have discussion. The industrial designer should produce a working design. The aim is to seel 50 million Euros. The production cost should be half the selling price. [SEP] PM: Uh I'm taking notes .
They each identify their individual tasks during each phase based on their role in the group. They briefly discuss characteristics of a desirable remote , including medium size buttons , small unit , and work within a good zapping range. The interface designer should specify technical functions. The marketing expert will come up with user requirements by doing internet research. They will receive more information by email The product will be sold at 25 Euros. To get started they will assume the remote to be for TV and video , and reserve the possibility to add features. [SEP] PM: and put it in the
The team again discusses their individual responsibilities and move on to ponder whether the remote will be multifunctional or only for the TV. [SEP] ID: So if I don't know
They decide to first assume it is only for TV and video , but allowing the possibility to add more features. [SEP] PM: {vocalsound} Th the least amount
They close the meeting upon establishing what each person will do. [SEP] PM: Let's see what we got
The marketing expert reported on research which shows that users think most remotes are ugly , easily lost and bad for RSI. There was some confusion about the the roles of the user interface designer and the industrial designer. [SEP] ME: Um {vocalsound} they do not
Audio settings are rarely used , and the power , channel and volume buttons are used most often. [SEP] ME: but we can skip that
The marketing expert and project manager described the new requirements that the target group is users under 40 , the remote should not include teletext , should be only for TV , and should feature the corporate logo. The remote should be user-friendly and have a good look and feel. The user interface designer showed examples of two contrasting remotes , recommending that they should use the best features of both. The group decided to use an LCD screen and speech recognition. The project manager will write up the meeting minutes. The remote will have an LCD screen and speech recognition. A teletext option will not be included. The remote will be for TV only. The remote will feature the corporate logo and colour. Some people had problems using the computers. [SEP] UI: So we have to make
The industrial designer described how a remote works , and explained that his presentation was incomplete because he had not received the necessary information in time. [SEP] ID: and the T_V_ will translate
The group discussed what functions to include and the layout of the remote , and the marketing expert drew a possible design on the board. They decided to have buttons for the basic functions and make the advanced functions accessible through the screen. They also discussed what buttons would be needed to navigate the menu on the LCD screen. The user interface designer will work on the layout of the remote and the LCD screen menu. The industrial designer will work on the functional aspects of the remote. The advanced functions such as audio settings , contrast and channel programming will be accessed through the screen. The target group will be aged 16-40. The screen and microphone will be at the top of the remote. There will be LEDs under the buttons so that buttons in use will light up. [SEP] ME: Yeah a audio settings ,
The marketing expert talked about trendwatching and explained that the current trends are for fruit and vegetable themed products and products with a spongy texture. For users , the three most important aspects of a remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , and ease of use. The industrial designer talked about the options for energy source , case shape and material , and internal components. The remote will use kinetic energy. The case will be double-curved and made of rubber. The remote will use an advanced chip. The industrial designer continued to have problems using power point , and felt that he did not have enough time to prepare his presentation. The group were unsure whether to use a single- or double-curved case. [SEP] ID: So uh w single curved
The user interface designer talked about speech recognition and what functions will be controlled through buttons or the lcd screen menu. The industrial designer and user interface designer will work together on the prototype design. [SEP] UI: And uh if there are
The group decided on using kinetic energy , and a double-curved rubber case. [SEP] ME: Rubber material .
The project manager ran through the group's decisions so far and led a discussion of their remaining options , including the colour of the case and buttons , and whether the remote should flip open or not. The group were unsure about the difference between a single- and double-curved case. The group were unsure whether they would be able to produce their design for 12.5 euros as they had not yet received any information about costs. The group were unsure about whether the remote should flip open or not and had trouble agreeing on a colour scheme. [SEP] ID: what we should do I
The project manager decided to start by looking at costs instead of the prototype presentation because the original design was too expensive and had to be changed. [SEP] PM: Okay , so we're at
The group discussed which features should be dropped. They decided to drop all the buttons in favour of an integrated scroll push-button , and to use a hand dynamo instead of kinetic energy as a power source. The group decided that the LCD screen was integral to their design , but dropped the speech recognition. The remote will be single-curved. The remote will no longer feature speech recognition , but will still have an LCD screen. It will be made of plastic instead of rubber. It will have one integrated scroll push-button and no other buttons. The remote will be powered by a hand dynamo instead of kinetic energy. The group were unsure about which features to drop and which to keep. [SEP] ME: Okay . Make it a
The marketing expert led the prototype evaluation , based on the new design. The industrial designer was unsure about the value of the evaluation score. [SEP] ME: makes three point one one
The group were satisfied with the overall score of 3.1. [SEP] PM: So we're better than average
The industrial designer and user interface designer worked on a drawing of the new design , while the project manager and marketing manager worked on the final report. The group's original design was too expensive , costing 25 Euros , so the remote had to be substantially redesigned.
