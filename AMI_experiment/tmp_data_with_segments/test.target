The Project Manager gave an introduction to the goal of the project , to create a trendy yet user-friendly remote. She presented a long-range agenda for the whole project. [SEP] PM: how we're actually gonna put
The group introduced themselves to each other and practiced with the meeting room tools by drawing on the board. [SEP] ME: it's meant to be an
The Project Manager presented the project budget , the projected price point , and the projected profit aim for the project. [SEP] ME: and you did say earlier
Then the group began a discussion about their own experiences with remote controls to generate initial design ideas for making the product user-friendly. They discussed grouping features into a menu and adding an LCD display. [SEP] ME: The other thing is ,
They also discussed the look of various materials that may be used in the design , in keeping with the company's goal to create fashionable electronics. [SEP] PM: so yeah I guess that's
The Industrial Designer gave his presentation on the basic functions of the remote. [SEP] ID: But uh although we will
The industrial designer presented the basic components that remotes share and suggested that smaller batteries be considered in the product design. [SEP] ID: because they're small they're also
The User Interface Designer presented his ideas for making the remote easy-to-use; he discussed using a simple design and hiding complicated features from the main interface. [SEP] UI: and s maybe we we
The Marketing Expert presented the findings from a lab study on user requirements for a remote control device , and discussed users' demand for a simple interface and advanced technology. [SEP] ME: if there's any more information
The Project Manager presented the new requirements that the remote not include a teletext function , that it be used only to control television , and that it include the company image in its design. [SEP] PM: we want um fashionable ,
The group narrowed down their target marketing group to the youth market. [SEP] PM: I'm thinking uh young ,
They discussed the functions the remote will have , including Video Plus capability and rechargeable batteries. A customer service plan was suggested to make the remote seem more user-friendly , but it was decided that helpful manuals were more within the budget. [SEP] PM: But we should focus on
The group then discussed the shell-like shape of the remote and including several different casing options to buyers. [SEP] UI: Yeah maybe we could come
The Project Manager reviewed the decisions from the previous meeting. [SEP] PM: and we were gonna think
The Marketing Expert made a presentation on trend watching , including trends in user requirements and trends in fashion. [SEP] ME: There also seems to be
The Industrial Designer presented all the components of the device and announced that several of the features already discussed would not be available. He suggested substituting a kinetic battery for the rechargeable batteries and using a combination of rubber and plastic for the materials. [SEP] ID: so perhaps uh some something
The User Interface Designer presented his main interface design , which included buttons for the most frequently used features and a graphic user interface on the LCD screen for other functions , to keep frequently used features easy to use. He announced that speech recognition was still an option to consider , depending on price. [SEP] UI: so we we we would
The Project Manager then began a discussion to decide what was going into the final design. It was decided that a kinetic battery would be used in place of a rechargeable battery , that the remote will feature an LCD screen and rubber casing and rubber buttons , and that interchangeable rubber covers in fruit colors will be available. Speech recognition may be included if it is not too costly. [SEP] ID: Yeah , depending on the
The Project Manager went over decisions from the previous meeting. [SEP] PM: Um {vocalsound} and the rubber
The Industrial Designer presented the prototype and discussed its look , its internal components , and its interface. [SEP] ID: as that is {disfmarker} that's
The Marketing Expert evaluated the product according to the initial product goals. [SEP] ME: i it's close around neutral
The group then decided that enough of this criteria had been satisfied for the project to continue. [SEP] ME: and I really doubt if
The Project Manager presented the final cost of the device which exceeded the initial projected price point. The group decided to remove speech recognition but to propose to the management that it  remain in the design. [SEP] UI: So we are under the
The group then discussed their effectiveness as a team. All members felt that they interacted well and that they felt they could be creative. [SEP] PM: you two created that wonderful
The Marketing Expert felt that the market-research based approach would help the project's success with consumers. [SEP] ME: and I think it's wonderful
The group did express , however , that the budget was overly constraining. [SEP] ME: I think we've done very
The Project Manager instructed the group to fill out a final evaluation questionnaire. [SEP] PM: we've got about fifty minutes
The Project Manager introduced the project aim and agenda to the group. The group introduced themselves and their roles to each other. [SEP] PM: And uh having uh meetings
The group acquainted themselves with the meeting-room equipment by drawing on the whiteboard. [SEP] PM: and so hopefully um won't
The Project Manager discussed the projected production cost and price point for the device. [SEP] PM: And so depending what the
The group began a discussion about their own experiences with using remote controls and about usability features to be included in the design. The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to prepare the working design , the User Interface Designer to research technical functions , and the Marketing Expert to prepare the user requirement specification. [SEP] PM: Marketing , the user requirement
The group discussed the function of the prototype and decided that they should restrict the remote to television for the time being. [SEP] PM: But at this point in
The Project Manager gave the group new requirements on product features. [SEP] PM: So I I got that
The Industrial Designer gave a presentation on the working design of the device. He presented all the necessary internal components and how they operate together. [SEP] ID: Um and then the sender
The industrial designer gave his preferences on energy sources and senders. [SEP] ID: Um and then the sender
The User Interface Designer presented the necessary functions of the remote , then compared the interfaces of two existing remotes. [SEP] PM: Um we have to remember
The group discussed making their remote more user-friendly; they proposed eliminating rarely-used buttons and making it easier to skip through channels. [SEP] PM: Well we've we've got um
The Marketing Expert discussed user requirements with the group and showed that users wanted a fancier , less complicated remote that would not be easily lost. [SEP] ME: and we should sort of
The marketing expert suggested incorporating a menu and an LCD screen to satisfy these requirements. [SEP] ID: and they might end up
The group discussed how to incorporate a locator function. [SEP] PM: Well if it does then
The Project Manager reminded the group to limit the number of complicated features due to the project's time constraints. [SEP] PM: and then get to the
The group had a discussion to decide on product features. [SEP] ID: Yeah I suppose if we've
They decided to include a clapping locator function and a device that allows the user to enter two numbers separately to get a two-digit number. [SEP] ID: I'll put delay to allow
Complicated functions will be hidden in a back panel. [SEP] ME: And then maybe sort of
The Project Manager reviewed the minutes from the last meeting. [SEP] PM: and then the uh the
The Industrial Designer discussed options for each of the internal components. He showed that the size of the chip was dependent on the type and number of additional features used. [SEP] ID: so that is something I'll
The group discussed incorporating speech recognition and other functions to be able to decide on chip size. They decided that using speech recognition for the locator function only would allow them to use a simple chip. [SEP] ID: but {disfmarker} Maybe we maybe
The User Interface Designer presented several existing products. She presented a specialized children's remote; the group decided to focus on a basic remote that would appeal to a wide market. [SEP] PM: and that uh you would
The user interface designer expressed that buttons are often ambiguously shaped and that their remote must have an easy-to-use interface. [SEP] ID: So maybe we could have
The Marketing Expert presented trends in the remote control market and the fruit and vegetable and spongy material trends in fashion. [SEP] ME: or or you know ,
The group discussed ways to incorporate these trends. They decided to make the standby button shaped like an apple , to use a rubber case and buttons , and to use a single-curved shape. [SEP] ME: whereas just the fact that
The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype. [SEP] UI: Uh just to keep the
The first prototype for the remote control was made of single-curved rubber with a total of 16 rubber buttons (some of them in a slide-out panel) with a cherry design on top. [SEP] ID: Yes , we'll have the
It uses kinetic energy and has a sample sensor for the speech recognition. [SEP] ID: I {gap} switching around those
Although over budget , the team decided to evaluate this prototype before making any changes. The initial cost was calculated at 13.70 Euros. [SEP] ME: So , we've all got
On a scale from 1 (true) to 7 (false) they rated it on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (2) , technological innovation (2) , ease of use (1) , incorporation of fashion elements (2) , and brand recognition (2). [SEP] ID: {vocalsound} As an overall product
Changing the rubber case to plastic reduced the cost and allowed for an extra button-form and colour. [SEP] PM: Well , we decided that
The team were reasonably satisfied with the project in terms of teamwork and creativity , although they thought that the flow of information was sometimes disjointed. However , the idea of designing a remote control seemed unexciting , especially since the requirements restricted it to TV only , and the budget was too small. Finally , some new ideas were also found in the form of kinetic energy source and use of speech recognition. [SEP] UI: Voice um recognition thing .
The meeting opens with the group doing introductions by giving their name and role. Betty is the project manager , Francina is the user interface specialist , Eileen is the marketing expert , and Jeanne is the industrial designer. [SEP] PM: I am the project manager
The project manager tells them they will be designing a new remote control that should be original , trendy , and user-friendly. They will be concerned with functional , conceptional , and detailed design. [SEP] PM: Detailed design , same thing
To try out the whiteboard , each group member draws her favorite animal on the board. [SEP] PM: And remember you have to
They discuss the project budget and then talk about their experiences with remote controls. [SEP] PM: now having used a remote
They seemed to agree that the remote should be compact and have a multi-purpose functions. [SEP] UI: Like uh the remote control
They also agree that it should do something different that current controls cannot do and that it should be made of different colors , materials , and shapes. [SEP] PM: Maybe it should {disfmarker} different
They also discuss a way of helping people find the remote when it is lost- a signal , whether it is a beep or light. [SEP] PM: and I I think uh
Then they close the meeting with the project manager going over the tasks they are to complete and telling them they will meet again in about thirty minutes. [SEP] PM: Then uh we see you
The meeting begins and the marketing expert starts her presentation promptly , telling them that her research shows they need a focus- it is not possible to make a device that works on the whole house. [SEP] ME: At the budget that we're
The project manager steps in and informs them that they have instructions to eliminate the teletext idea because it is too complicated , and also said they must maintain the corporate image by using corporate designs and colors. [SEP] PM: and the third thing that
The marketing expert resumes , talking about how remotes often get lost and that a light emitter might be useful. [SEP] ME: Um and then maybe a
The industrial designer gives her presentation , talking about components , materials , and energy sources. They discuss giving the control different shapes to suit both adults and children , making the buttons various shapes , and putting a display clock on the control. [SEP] ID: And uh uh of course
The interface designer presents , talking about the features users like on a remote and suggesting that they make the remote a T-shape and add an alarm clock function. They discuss their target group and the possibility of removable plastic cases. [SEP] ID: If we do some more
They close the meeting deciding to do more research on the plastic cases. [SEP] PM: So now I understand it's
The project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting. [SEP] PM: Uh are we all in
The interface specialist begins her presentation by highlighting important remote functions and showing examples of remote interfaces. [SEP] UI: And the personal preference {vocalsound}
The group comments on her presentation , and then the industrial designer begins presenting. [SEP] ID: Um this time I'm I'm
The industrial designer talks about the technical electronic components of the remote , explains how a remote works , and shows a few pictures revealing the insides of a normal remote control. She suggests giving the remote a strong shell so it is durable , using a rechargable battery , and not adding a scroll wheel because it requires a sophisticated chip. [SEP] ID: So I think it's better
The marketing expert presents , talking about user preferences for a small , simple , eye-catching , cute , appealing , and functional remote. Fruit and vegetable shapes are popular this year , so a soft , spongy remote perhaps covered with cloth could make the item marketable. [SEP] ME: They are more back into
The group discusses the issues surrounding speech recognition , noting that if it is good quality it could be costly. They about the power source and review the objectives of the product. [SEP] ME: Okay , so why don't
The project manager closes the meeting by telling each member what task she is to complete. [SEP] PM: {vocalsound} You will receive specific
The project manager opens the meeting by going over the minutes of the last meeting , detailing the main points of each person's presentation. [SEP] PM: should be trendy design ,
They do the prototype presentation which includes a model of the remote control. [SEP] UI: And at the end ,
The group discusses this proposed model , approving of the small size and look of it. [SEP] ME: I think we have to
They goes over finances and are pleased to find that they are well within budget. [SEP] PM: looks like we are well
However , while the marketing expert is doing the product evaulation the group realizes that they neglected to calculate voice recognition into the financing. Their cost had been 8.20 Euros and they have  4.30 left to cover it , so they decide to settle for whatever quality it will buy. [SEP] ME: So we're just gonna have
They rate their product on its shape , size , color , feel , and functionality. [SEP] ME: It looks like we've got
They discuss the project process , talk briefly about adding more features , and one member suggests eliminating a mute buttons and include a diffferent feature. [SEP] PM: Uh , um are we
They are happy with the creativity , leadership , and teamwork within the group , and close the meeting by thanking one another. [SEP] PM: So I {disfmarker} I thank
The project manager introduced himself to the team and then acquainted the team with the audio and video equipment in the meeting room. [SEP] PM: There are some notes in
The project manager briefly described the company the team works for and discussed the corporate website. The project manager then described the upcoming project and the roles of each team member. [SEP] PM: But that will be all
The project manager introduced the smart boards to the team and led the team members in an exercise in which they each drew their favorite animal and described why they liked the animal. [SEP] ME: Yeah .
The project manager briefed the team on the project budget and selling prices for the remote they are to create and led them in a discussion on their experiences with remote controls and what features they would like to include in their product. [SEP] ME: But maybe just a little
The project manager stated the agenda and the marketing expert discussed what functions are most relevant on a remote , what the target demographic is , and what his vision for the appearance of the remote is. [SEP] ME: Uh I think the most
The marketing expert also brought up the idea to include a docking station to prevent the remote from getting lost and the idea to include an LCD screen. [SEP] ME: but I think these are
The user interface designer pushed for a user-friendly interface with large buttons , a display function , a touchscreen , and the capability of controlling different devices. [SEP] ID: But the {disfmarker} It wouldn't
The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the project manager briefed the team on some new requirements they are to abide by. [SEP] PM: So it has to be
The team then discussed teletext , the target demographic , the buttons the remote should have , the idea of marketing a remote designed for the elderly , an audio signal which can sound if the remote is lost , LCD screens , and language options. [SEP] ME: which tend to have a
The project manager opened the meeting and recapped the decisions made in the previous meeting. [SEP] PM: um I suggest let's get
The marketing expert discussed his personal preferences for the design of the remote and presented the results of trend-watching reports , which indicated that there is a need for products which are fancy , innovative , easy to use , in dark colors , in recognizable shapes , and in a familiar material like wood. [SEP] ME: The wood-like for the more
The user interface designer discussed the option to include speech recognition and which functions to include on the remote. [SEP] UI: and a special uh button
The industrial designer discussed which options he preferred for the remote in terms of energy sources , casing , case supplements , buttons , and chips. [SEP] ID: Um for the case ,
The team then discussed and made decisions regarding energy sources , speech recognition , LCD screens , chips , case materials and colors , case shape and orientation , and button orientation. [SEP] PM: Then {disfmarker} We've got a
In the detailed design meeting the team created a prototype. [SEP] ID: this is what me and
Along with buttons for numbers , channel selector , volume , mute , on-off , teletext , and subtitles , the prototype included an LCD screen and a help button for functional information. [SEP] PM: which can provide extra information
One rechargable battery , single-curve form and plastic case , brought the total cost to 17 Euros. [SEP] PM: I think we can uh
The remaining buttons were one for channel selection , one for volume (both assisted by the scrollwheel) , teletext , on-off and the help button. All these components were re-arranged in a revised prototype. To reduce this cost , it was decided to replace most buttons with a scrollwheel. [SEP] PM: So we can decrease this
It was evaluated on a scale from 1 to 7 on the basis of the following criteria: fancy design (6) , technological innovation (4) , functionality (7) , consideration of the target group (3). The remote was also recognisable as a fashionable Real Reaction product. [SEP] PM: I think that's a pretty
The project process was deemed well-structured , although everyone thought it would have been better had they known the component prices at an earlier stage. Teamword and leadership were good , but room for creativity impeded by budget constraints. [SEP] ID: The tasks are very structured
A suggestion to target the product to a younger or perhaps more general group was met with approval. [SEP] PM: Just put it on the
The Project Manager introduced the aim of the project and gave a brief agenda for the entire project. The participants introduced themselves and their roles to each other. [SEP] PM: Then the conceptual design .
The project manager then introduced and explained how to use the meeting-room materials. [SEP] PM: {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} This uh
The group acquainted themselves with the materials by drawing on the smartboard. [SEP] ID: Yeah , exactly . {vocalsound}
The Project Manager presented the project budget and explained that the device would not be made very high-tech due to the small budget. He explained that the device would be sold internationally. [SEP] PM: we can sell our r
The group discussed their initial ideas of features to include in the design; the Marketing Expert discussed usability features , such as the ability to control multiple devices and an LCD screen , to make the product unique. The Project Manager instructed the Industrial Designer to work on the working design and the User Interface Designer to research the technical functions. [SEP] PM: {vocalsound} Uh the User Interface
The group discussed the timing of when they would make decisions on the features discussed. [SEP] PM: And uh then we're going
When this functional design meeting opens the project manager tells  the group about the project restrictions he received from management by email. [SEP] PM: is that they uh want
The marketing expert is first to present , summarizing user requirements data from a questionaire given to 100 respondents. [SEP] ME: Uh second audience audience is
The marketing expert explains various user preferences and complaints about remotes as well as different interests among age groups. [SEP] ME: {vocalsound} they use teletext and
The marketing expert prefers that they aim users from ages 16-45 , improve the most-used functions , and make a placeholder for the remote. [SEP] ME: Yeah , perhaps .
The industrial designer begins explaining the working design. [SEP] ID: And I'll explain a bit
The industrial designer talks about existing products , most of which use infared since it is simple and cost-effective. [SEP] ID: but then you'd still have
The industrial designer suggests adding a speech function , when someone asks where the remote is and it beeps. [SEP] ID: I dunno uh what the
The industrial designer also explains the various components , materials , and energy sources of a remote , giving preference to a remote with multifunctional buttons and without a receiver. [SEP] ID: but we we should stick
The interface specialist presents , talking about the possible components of the remote and concluding that the remote should be simple and accessible without too much functionality. [SEP] UI: If the user is pushing
The group continues the meeting by having discussion about the possibility of a touch screen , LCD , and other functions. [SEP] ME: And also like a clapping
The group closes the meeting and goes to lunch. [SEP] PM: You all uh have the
The project manager went over the agenda. [SEP] PM: uh and at the end
The industrial designer gave a presentation about the options for power source , materials and components. He recommended using kinetic energy , and having a double-curved rubber case. The group decided to combine batteries and kinetic energy. [SEP] PM: I I uh I would
The marketing expert reported on current trends among young people for fresh fruity colours and spongy material. He explained that the remote should look fancy , and be technologically innovative and easy to use. He suggested using removable customisable covers , speech recognition , installing some games into the remote , and implementing a parental control feature. [SEP] ME: And third , I stick
The user interface designer talked about having a simple layout with not many buttons. [SEP] UI: And um , things like
Most features will be controlled through the menu. [SEP] UI: But um , well m
The group discussed the various options and decided to use games but not speech recognition. [SEP] PM: We take it to the
After a lot of discussion they decided to implement a simple parental control feature. [SEP] PM: The parental control will be
The project manager talked about what he had learned at a masterclass on knowledge management. [SEP] PM: What other companies uh had
The group discussed how to incorporate the company logo and motto onto the remote , including having an animated logo on the touch screen. [SEP] ME: It it's just like a
The project manager gave the group instructions about what to do before the next meeting. [SEP] PM: But keep an eye on
The project manager opened the meeting and went over the agenda. [SEP] PM: Once again , forty minutes
The user interface designer and the industrial designer presented their prototype design , describing the shape and layout of the remote. [SEP] ID: We we just want to
The group discussed colour options and decided to make the standard remote in fruity colours , but with the option of buying different exchangeable covers which might appeal more to older buyers. [SEP] PM: Not too , but w
The marketing expert led the prototype evaluation and the group were happy with their product. [SEP] ME: all the requirements uh are
The group calculated the production costs. [SEP] ID: Well , we're only four
The group were 4 euros over budget , so they decided to make the case single-curved and not to use kinetic energy. [SEP] PM: Well , we were above
The project manager led the evaluation of the project process. The group felt that only the industrial designer and the user interface designer were able to be creative and work as a team. It was felt that the first meeting was disorganised because of poor leadership but the leadership improved in the later meetings. The group were also had problems with the digital pens. [SEP] UI: To use , yeah .
The group helped the project manager fill in the final report before the close of the meeting. [SEP] PM: I'm going to finish my
