The project manager opened the meeting by stating the agenda and then introduced the upcoming project to the team members. [SEP] PM: we'll have a functional design
The team members then participated in an exercise in which they each drew their favorite animal and discussed why they liked the particular animal. [SEP] PM: And I think your pen's
The project manager briefed the team on the production and selling costs of the remote they are to create. [SEP] PM: Um the production is to
The project manager also briefed the team on the profit aim and discussed how many remotes must be sold in order to reach the profit aim of 50 million Euro. [SEP] PM: four million . You'd have
The team then discussed their experiences using remote controls and what features in terms of functionality and appearance to consider in making the remote. [SEP] ME: make everything menus .
The project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting. [SEP] PM: Um , then we'll move
The marketing expert discussed user preferences in terms of remote controls and the increasing interest among younger consumers in speech recognition. [SEP] ME: these market research uh uh
The marketing expert also discussed a user target group for the remote and addressed the issue of whether the target group would result in sufficient sales of the remote. [SEP] ME: and to be extraordinarily reductionist
The user interface designer presented two existing remote controls on the market , which the team later evaluated , and discussed what features in terms of appearance and functionality the remote the team is creating should include. [SEP] UI: that's that for now .
The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and addressed the issue of what happens when remotes no longer operate. [SEP] UI: It does it does seem
The team also discussed options for energy sources , such as solar power and rechargeable internal batteries. [SEP] UI: Still I don't know if
Th team then discussed their user target group , marketing ideas such as selling the remote to television manufacturers , and what functions the remote would feature. [SEP] UI: I'll just use it from
The project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting. [SEP] PM: Kate was gonna look at
The marketing expert presented findings from trend watching reports and discussed her personal preferences in how to incorporate the results of the trend watching reports into the appearance of the remote. The trend watching reports indicated that products need to reflect a fruit and vegetable theme , sponginess , fanciness , and technological innovation. [SEP] ME: So I really open this
The team then discussed their target group and whether to use titanium or a spongy material in their design. [SEP] ME: I was really thinking a
The industrial designer discussed options for energy sources , materials , case shapes , and interface components such as buttons and LCD screens. [SEP] ID: but um unfortunately I see
The user interface designer examined the interfaces of existing products and discussed using menus within an interface using push buttons which operate like a scroll wheel. [SEP] UI: If we're having the scroll
The team then discussed and made decisions on what energy sources , chips , case materials , and buttons to use. [SEP] UI: I'd {disfmarker} like push buttons
The project manager opened the meeting and went over the minutes of the previous meeting. [SEP] PM: and we had some conflict
The user interface designer and industrial designer then presented two prototypes of the remote the team is working on and discussed the options for components and materials to include in their design. The first prototype featured a simple design with only a small number of buttons. The second prototype was shaped like a banana and used scroll push button technology. [SEP] UI: and what sort of ,
The marketing expert then led the team in conducting a product evaluation of the prototypes in which the prototypes were evaluated on the basis of their fanciness , technological innovation , ease of use , trendiness , and marketability. [SEP] ME: Thank you for everyone's help
The project manager then examined the production costs of the remote. [SEP] PM: We had the special colour
The cost to produce the remote was 9.20 pounds and did not exceed the project budget. [SEP] ID: More profit .
The team then conducted an evaluation of the project process , in which they indicated that they were quite happy with the tools available to them , the ideas they came up with , and their teamwork. [SEP] ID: I'm not sure all the
Overall , the prototypes performed quite well in the evaluation. [SEP] UI: which if it works perfectly
The project manager opens the meeting by introducing herself and asking everyone to say their name and role in the group. [SEP] PM: If everyone could go around
The project manager then states the agenda of the meeting and tells them that they will be designing and creating a new remote control that should be trendy and user-friendly. The meetings will focus on functional , conceptual , and detailed design. [SEP] PM: Same with conceptual design and
Next , each group member draws their favorite animal on the whiteboard and explains the characteristics of that animal. [SEP] ME: because I saw a butterfly
After that the project manager covers the project budget , and then they begin discussing their personal experiences with remote controls and how they want their remote to look. [SEP] PM: And the key issue here
Then the project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what to do in preparation for the next meeting. [SEP] PM: Um , you will get
The project manager opens the meeting , asking the industrial designer to present first. [SEP] PM: the first presentation we'll be
The industrial designer begins talking about the functional aspect of the working design and features to make the product unique , such as visibility in the dark , locator alarm , and environmentally-friendly materials. To make an environmental impact , they could use smart materials that can be heated and cooled so that the individual components easily separate to be reused or recycled. The group asks some questions about this idea and then the interface designer presents about technical functions , explaining the difference between a multifunctional and single function remote. [SEP] UI: So it would be cheaper
The group discusses the two types and decides that a single function design is more suitable for the budget. [SEP] UI: And with this we'll have
The marketing expert presents on user requirements by using research done on remote control users. She summarizes these findings andexplains her personal preference for a user-friendly , unique design since certain features could be too complex. [SEP] ME: Um , so I I
The project manager receives some decision-affecting information from management , which she shares with the group. [SEP] ME: It's probably R_ R_R_ in
They have a discussion about the remote control functions and close the meeting. [SEP] PM: We'll have to do more
The project manager opens this conceptual design meeting and gives them the agenda. [SEP] PM: The meeting will be forty
The industrial designer presents first and talks about the components of a remote , energy source options , and materials for the remote , case , and buttons. [SEP] ID: Like if the kinetic thing
The interface specialist presents the interface concept by explaining the difference between graphical and command interface. They decide the command interface is most useful for a remote because it is simpler and more user-friendly. [SEP] UI: to make it more simplistic
The group discusses aspects of the user interface including the lighting up effect and material of the buttons. [SEP] ID: I don't think it would
The marketing expert presents on trend-watching and talks about how fruit and vegetables are an important fashion theme this year , and says the material used is expected to be spongy. [SEP] ME: The fruits and vegetable themes
The group discusses how they could implement these fashion trends into the design , then finalizes a few decisions about the components , materials , and energy sources. [SEP] ME: 'cause it , {vocalsound} mm
The project manager closes the meeting , stating what each member's next task will be. [SEP] PM: And , um , your
The project manager opens the meeting by stating the agenda. The designers give the prototype presentation , showing their simple design that is based on a mango. [SEP] UI: It's um based on a
They point out the company logo and LED , and demonstrate how the device is palm-held and thumb-acessible. [SEP] UI: buttons are accessible from your
They also discuss the numerical , volume , channel , and power buttons as well as the color scheme. [SEP] ID: or vanilla might be the
The marketing expert administers the product evaluation , and they rate each of the ten criteria on a scale of 1-7. [SEP] ME: So basically the lower p
The criteria includes fancy look-and-feel , technological innovation , ease of use , look , whether people would be willing to spend 25 Euros for it , whether its operating behavior matches the average user , ease of finding when lost , ease of learning to use , whether it will minimize RSI , incorporation of company colors and logo , and whether it follows the motto. [SEP] PM: But maybe more like two
They average the scores and get 1.9. [SEP] PM: Yeah it is one point
They check the product costing and find that their operating cost is 12.20 Euros. [SEP] PM: So um our operating cost
In evaluating the project process they are pleased with their creativity , leadership , timing , teamwork , discussions , and overall product given the resources they had. [SEP] ME: Yeah well I guess we
They close the meeting by thanking one another. [SEP] ID: Thank you very much .
The project manager opened the meeting and had the team members introduce themselves and describe their roles in the upcoming project. [SEP] ID: And uh the detailed design
The project manager then described the upcoming project. [SEP] PM: {vocalsound} Um we've got the
The team then discussed their experiences with remote controls. [SEP] PM: we want it to be
They also discussed the project budget and which features they would like to see in the remote control they are to create. The team discussed universal usage , how to find remotes when misplaced , shapes and colors , ball shaped remotes , marketing strategies , keyboards on remotes , and remote sizes. [SEP] ID: Otherwise the design of {disfmarker}
The project manager recapped the events and decisions of the previous meeting. [SEP] PM: Um we decided that it
The marketing expert presented research on user preferences and tendencies with remote controls. The research indicated that users want remotes to be more attractive , to match the behavior of the user , to be easier to locate when misplaced , and not to cause RSI. The research also indicated that younger users were interested speech recognition. [SEP] PM: what we should focus on
The user interface designer spoke on the option to have a universal remote , presented two differently designed remotes available on the market , and described some features a user-centered remote should include. [SEP] UI: Like I said to concentrate
The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and then the team discussed the option to include speech recognition in their design. [SEP] PM: It's a , it's a
The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements to abide by. [SEP] PM: And we could probably get
The team then discussed the option to include a recharger with a locater button in their design , the appearance of their remote , buttons , how to make an ergonomic remote , and the option to have a two-piece remote. [SEP] ID: And perhaps heavy ,
The project manager reviewed the minutes of the previous meeting. [SEP] PM: And with a scrolling um
The marketing expert discussed the results of trend watching reports which indicated a need for products which have a fancy look and feel , are technologically innovative , easy to use , include a fruit and vegetable theme , and are spongy in feel. [SEP] ME: Um and also , as
The marketing expert stressed the need to incorporate these findings into the team's design and suggested that the team should create a remote that has limited buttons  , can be personalized , and is not rectangular. [SEP] ME: Personalise your remote .
The user interface designer briefly described how speech recognition technology works and what ways a user can use a remote. [SEP] UI: Um and then it ju
The user interface designer presented three existing products on the market - a voice recognition remote , an iPod , and a children's remote - and discussed a few features to include in the team's design. [SEP] UI: it could be a graphical
The industrial designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and the restrictions involved in combining various components , energy sources , and materials. [SEP] ID: but we cannot add scroll
The industrial designer also discussed with the how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme into their design. [SEP] ID: an orange , banana ,
The team then discussed and decided what components , materials , and energy sources to use. [SEP] PM: {vocalsound} Which will require a
The project manager opened the meeting and read the minutes of the previous meeting. [SEP] PM: um and made a decision
The industrial designer and user interface designer presented the prototype they created , which was designed to look like a banana. [SEP] ID: It's a quick on-off button
The marketing expert conducted an evaluation of the prototype. The team found that , although the overall design of the prototype was attractive , its yellow color was ugly. [SEP] ME: Okay we'll say two point
The team rated the prototype highly on its ease of use and felt that its yellow color and shape detracted slightly from its ability to be misplaced and that a feature which causes the remote to make noise based on its proximity to a television needed to be added. [SEP] PM: Two .
The team thought the prototype was fashionable and not technologically innovative or spongy. [SEP] ID: {vocalsound} Well the recent fashion
The project manager led the team in calculating the production costs of the remote and ensuring that they aligned with the project budget. [SEP] PM: {vocalsound} we shouldn't be charged
The costs were over budget , so the team opted to exclude the LCD from their design to meet their budget. [SEP] ID: Right . We may not
The team conducted an evaluation of the project process and found that they performed well and were somewhat satisfied by the resources available to them. [SEP] ME: Minus your PowerPoint fiasco .
The meeting begins with the group trying to resolve some equipment issues and waiting for Anna's arrival. [SEP] ID: It's working {vocalsound} .
Then the project manager introduces the meeting by saying they have some technical tools with which to communicate so they will try to get acquainted with them first. [SEP] PM: and uh {disfmarker} wh what
The project manager starts talking about the product they are to design , a remote control which should be original , trendy , and user-friendly. The general outline of the project will be the functional , conceptual , and detailed design. [SEP] PM: in which the the final
They do some tool training by trying out the whiteboard , and each person draws his/her favorite animal on it. [SEP] ID: it's a shark ,
The project manager proceeds to talk about the project finance , which is followed by a group discussion about what functions a good remote control has. This includes the basics such as on/off , channel up/down browsing , volume and record button(s). [SEP] UI: you need to record the
At this point they clarify their names and roles in the group and then resume talking about remote control functions. [SEP] UI: And uh , you'd need
They discuss some functions such as a personal video recorder , but say it is probable that they cannot produce a fancy device given their budget. [SEP] PM: but but but ab about
The project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what he/she will be working on. [SEP] PM: next meeting will be in
The project manager opens the meeting and presents the agenda using slides. [SEP] ME: but I have no slides
The marketing expert explains the research she read about , which is a study done on 100 people asking their remote usage habits and preferences. [SEP] ME: but there's no figures apparently
The Industrial Designer presents , explaining the basic function of a remote control and how it works. He says they should first agree on the technical functions before he creates working design and chooses the chips and infrared components to build it. [SEP] PM: I think M Mael will
The Interface Designer gives his presentation , talking about the remote's technical function of sending a message to the TV set that is decoded by the TV. Standard TV remotes have an on/off button , play , volume change , number keypad , and a 1 or 2 digit option. [SEP] UI: but it then it has
The industrial designer suggests that in aiming for the next generation they should have a remote for the TV and video integrated together. [SEP] UI: you want to watch a
The project manager recieves a message from account manager , which he shares with the group. [SEP] PM: so when it looks too
They discuss and determine the target group as well as the possibility of making a universal remote for stereo , VCR , and TV. [SEP] UI: you can also browse through
They close the meeting with the project manager telling each group member what they will do before the next meeting. [SEP] PM: But you will be informed
Then the project manager opens the meeting announcing that they will address conceptual design and then giving the agenda. [SEP] PM: we have some uh forty
Matthew arrives late and the marketing expert begins her presentation about trends. [SEP] ME: The most important by far
The marketing expert emphasizes that the remote needs to be exciting , contain a cool feature , and be somewhat intuitive. [SEP] ME: So they have to be
The marketing expert reports that currently fruits and vegetables are fashionable- thus bright eye-catching colors , bold designs , and a spongy feel is appropriate. [SEP] ME: going with the fruit and
The marketing expert lists ideas such as changable covers , a locator , speech recognition , and LCD screens. [SEP] PM: I mean those covers could
The industrial specialist presents , talking about how a remote typically has different keys , structures and forms. He likes the idea of implenting speech recognition into a universal remote. [SEP] ME: or if they want to
They discuss without certainity about the cost of such functions. [SEP] ID: and w how much it's
The industrial designer presents about remote control components and the manufacturing process , listing options such as various buttons , scroll wheels , integrated push buttons like those in a computer mouse , and LCDs .  They discuss the project budget and the possibility of using an expensive chip. [SEP] ID: and how many buttons like
They decide to make two designs , one more advanced than the other. [SEP] PM: Let let's say next meeting
The project manager closes the meeting by telling each group member what his/her tasks will be until the next meeting. [SEP] PM: let's call this to an
As the meeting opens the project manager tells the group that they must stay within the budget of twelve Euro and fifty cents or will have to redesign. [SEP] ID: we we designed the two
After Matthew arrives the designers begin presenting the two prototypes , beginning with the basic conventional one which is shaped like a surfboard and costs 7 or 8 Euros to produce. [SEP] UI: Now we are supposed to
It contains an on-off button , volume switch , up/down channel function , 10 digits , and two extra buttons for teletext and an additional function. [SEP] PM: Exce except for the for
The next control is futuristic because feels like a mobile phone , has 6 keys , and is smooth. [SEP] UI: and uh it's easy to
It also has a power button , channel up/down , slow pause/slow stop , LCD screen , toggle switch that changes it from audio to video , and microphone. It would cost 16 Euros to produce , which is out of the budget. [SEP] ME: I do like the the
The marketing expert gives the product evaluation and they rate them on look and feel , innovation , ease of use , appeal to the correct demographic , and adherence to the company motto and fashion trends. [SEP] ME: so they're not really comparable
They discuss the energy source , shape , chip type , LCD and speech recognition , and additional buttons. [SEP] ME: are we basically back to
After choosing features their remote costs 12 Euros to produce. [SEP] PM: My m my supervisor will
They close the meeting by thanking one another. [SEP] ID: {vocalsound} Thanks .
The Project Manager introduced the project to the group and gave a timeline for the project. [SEP] PM: And then the desired devi
The group trained themselves to use the meeting room tools by drawing on the whiteboard. [SEP] PM: {vocalsound} Maybe I can draw
The Project Manager presented the project budget and the projected price point and profit goals. [SEP] PM: {vocalsound} Yeah if it's trendy
The group discussed several of their initial ideas for the features of the product. They discussed making the remote able to control multiple devices , protection from water or from dropping the remote , and a locator function. [SEP] PM: {vocalsound} Okay so try to
The Project Manager then instructed the User Interface Designer to research users' requirements , and instructed the Industrial and User Interface Designers to research the functions and usability features that were discussed in the meeting. [SEP] PM: and uh look at your
The User Interface Designer presented the major components of the interface design , dividing the interface into two parts: voice commands and buttons. [SEP] UI: We could assign any button
The Marketing Expert went over users' requirements as seen in a company study and showed that the major complaint was that remotes were too difficult to use. She also showed that users want fancier and more ergonomic designs , shock protection , voice recognition , and LCD screens. The Project Manager announced a new requirement to the group , that the remote is only to control televisions. [SEP] PM: and they seems to tell
The Industrial Designer gave a layout of the internal functions of the device and showed that a standard chip , instead of a larger one that would accomodate voice recognition , would be the most feasible. [SEP] ID: and what about if we
The Project Manager announced also that the group was not to include a teletext function and that they should integrate the company logo into the external design. [SEP] PM: And then also we have
The group decided on what button functions should be included and decided to eliminate the LCD screen and voice recognition from the design due to time and cost restraints. [SEP] PM: But eight months is really
The Industrial Designer presented the functional components that will appear in the prototype , and discussed with the group the high cost of the wheel sensor and the possibility of incorporating speech recognition. [SEP] ID: Yeah , a little bit
The User Interface Designer presented existing remote controls to help show the interface of the prototype. He showed how the new design will be more simple and ergonomic than the models he displayed by eliminating extra functions. [SEP] UI: and uh user could use
The Marketing Expert presented news about trends in fashion and in the market that will be incorporated into the design. [SEP] ME: {vocalsound} And the mm the
A fruit and vegetable theme and spongy materials are popular trends that will be used in the design. They decided to make the remote shaped like a banana and spongy , to have the buttons lighted , to have a wheel sensor at the top of the device , and to use only a standard chip and battery that would not accomodate speech recognition. The group finalized which features they wanted to integrate into the design. [SEP] PM: I think it's the box
The Project Manager instructed the User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer to construct the prototype , and announced that the prototype would be evaluated in the next meeting. [SEP] PM: I think it's the box
The Project Manager presented the final cost of the remote with the finalized list of components. The final cost was under the alotted budget; the Project Manager announced that the project could then continue with the current prototype. [SEP] PM: we can uh {disfmarker} we
The Marketing Expert presented an evaluation of the prototype to the group. [SEP] ME: And after we ha we
The group evaluated the prototype based on the requirements of users presented in the first meetings. [SEP] ME: Uh if we say that
The group decided that the prototype met enough of these goals to be able to market the product. [SEP] PM: So having this at twenty
The prototype was presented and the group discussed the look of the prototype. The Project Manager summarized the accomplishments of the meeting. [SEP] PM: I think it was a
The Project Manager reviewed new requirements for the project with the group and discussed their implementation. [SEP] UI: We want something that looks
The Industrial Designer presented the basic components of a remote control device and how they work together. He showed that the size of the chip they will use is dependent on how many complicated functions are included. [SEP] UI: That's all I have really
The User Interface Designer stressed that the project should focus on a simple design for the device. [SEP] ID: Um and uh although I
The group discussed not being able to include a teletext component , and that the product design would have to be the main selling point of the device. [SEP] UI: I think all these things
The Marketing Expert discussed his marketing strategy for the project , again stressing the attractiveness of the product design. [SEP] ME: but again , because what
The Industrial Designer proposed including a battery charging stand with the device but it was decided that it was not a useful feature. The group continued to discuss the marketing strategy for the device as it would not include many advanced technological functions; they discussed including a guarantee for the remote and using a unique form factor. [SEP] ME: And and then and then
The Industrial Designer presented an overview of the internal components of a remote control device. [SEP] UI: This is pretty standard remote
The industrial designer discussed energy source and material options , and suggested that using rubber and plastic would be the most versatile option. [SEP] UI: Um so these are all
The industrial designer displayed the three options for chips. [SEP] UI: That's the end of my
The User Interface Designer discussed voice recognition with the group , and the group decided to not use it in their design. [SEP] UI: I think it's a bad
The user interface designer suggested using rubber buttons because of their durability. [SEP] ID: and more resistant to things
The user interface designer discussed the size of the device and the layout of the interface , and suggested that the remote be moderately sized to prevent its getting lost. [SEP] ID: and uh is not too
The Marketing Expert expressed concern that the remote lacked enough features to be distinctive. [SEP] ME: If you if you give
The group had a discussion to decide on the product features. They decided to include a charging stand , to use a thin rubber casing material , to include a locator function and a scroll wheel with two channel-changing options to increase its usability. [SEP] PM: Just a very thin sorta
The group discussed the cost of the various components and decided to sell the device at a point between thirty-five and fifty Euros. [SEP] ID: Okay so we'll come up
The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer were instructed to construct the prototype. [SEP] PM: Okay so you guys will
The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented the prototype to the group and displayed all of its components. They demonstrated how the locator function operates. They suggested that a trigger button should be included in a later designing phase to improve the feel of the product. [SEP] ME: My my s my suggestion
The Marketing Expert gave an evaluation of the product and felt that it satisfied his criteria. He suggested including a lifetime guarantee and expressed concern that the remote would only be used for televisions. [SEP] PM: b because at the moment
The Project Manager discussed the final production cost with the group; after an analysis of all of the components the final cost was 15.8 Euros. The Project Manager then led a discussion about the group's experience on the project. [SEP] PM: I think we we ended
The group felt that they worked well together and that they had room to be creative , but only after they changed many of the initial specifications. [SEP] ID: It was more of a
They also had difficulties using the meeting-room equipment. [SEP] ME: And of course I did
They were satisfied with the increased final cost and budget. [SEP] PM: Not the original budget ,
The project manager introduced the upcoming project to the team members and discussed the roles of each member and the selling price for the remote they will produce. Then the team participated in an exercise in which they all drew animals. [SEP] ID: I have an idea of
The User Interface Designer discussed  some characteristics and functions to consider in designing the remote and introduced an idea for giving the remote international appeal by merging it with a system such as Google. [SEP] ID: but the question is how
The Industrial Designer discussed the interior workings of a remote and presented options for components and materials which would keep costs low. [SEP] PM: I think it's would be
The Marketing Expert presented consumer preferences and requirements. The project manager introduced the new requirements for the project. The team then discussed different features they could include in the design of the remote. [SEP] PM: I think it would be
The User Interface Designer presented three different concepts to consider for the user interface and introduced the idea of using speech recognition in the design of the remote. The team discussed the issue of using speech recognition at length. [SEP] PM: Maybe we'll be able to
The Industrial Designer presented possible materials to use in making the case for the remote , introduced the option of using a solar battery , and discussed options for buttons. [SEP] ME: It's it's expensive I I
The Marketing Specialist  discussed recent findings from trend watching reports. [SEP] ME: plastic-like , but rubber ,
The team discussed what materials to use and their interface concept. [SEP] PM: Okay .
The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented their prototype for the remote. The prototype was yellow and red and was shaped like a mushroom. The team then conducted a product evaluation of the prototype. [SEP] PM: It looks {vocalsound} more like
Overall , the team found the prototype to be technologically innovative but had some issues with the prototype's appearance and its usability. [SEP] ME: Yeah , especially on the
The team decided that the prototype required further work. [SEP] PM: But I d m I
The team then discussed the production costs of the remote and what features they should retain or lose in order to maintain their target cost. In discussing the production costs , the team settled on what features they wanted in the remote , while staying within the boundaries of their budget , and decided it was not necessary to completely redesign their product. [SEP] ID: It's fine , twelve fifty
The team then engaged in a project evaluation in which the team discussed the process of creating their product. [SEP] PM: and we have a nearly
The project manager Sebastian opens the meeting. The rest introduce themselves , including Michael the interface designer , Guillermo the marketing expert , and Hemant the industrial designer. The project manager states the goal of the project , which is to develop a new remote control. It should be original , trendy , and user-friendly. He also mentions the three-step project- functional design , conceptual design , and detailed design. [SEP] PM: and will m we will
Then they take turns drawing their favorite animal on the white board. [SEP] ID: So , not the favourite
After that they briefly discuss finances. The remote control's target selling price of twenty-five Euro dollars and will be for the international market. They need to generate a profit of fifty million Euros. [SEP] PM: which which would generate a
The question of whether the remote control should be for a specific device was brought up but not answered. The project manager closes the meeting , telling each group member what he is responsible for and reminding them that they will receive more information by email. [SEP] PM: Um you will receive some
The project manager opens the meeting stating that they will address the functional design of the remote and saying they are still undecided about whether it should be universal or specific. [SEP] PM: so we are going to
The project manager suggests they name the project and they come up with "mando" , meaning "control" in Spanish. [SEP] PM: {vocalsound} So , let's go
The marketing expert presents some research done on user opinions of remotes. [SEP] ID: Well maybe it could be
The marketing expert suggests the use of using voice recognition or an LCD , which they discuss despite concerns about budget limitation. [SEP] ID: It requir recognises particular sequence
The industrial designer presents , showing examples of existing products and suggesting they add a scroll wheel for channel-changing. He says Internet capability might be necessary for an LCD and then brings up button size , suggesting having a flip-open door with extra buttons under it. [SEP] UI: Then you say potentially you
They discuss voice recognition again , and then the interface specialist presents. He suggests they have two types of user interfaces and brings up that voice recognition would increase production price. [SEP] UI: you know if I was
They talk about the budget limitations on features and then the project manager summarizes decisios made and closes the meeting by teeling each group member what he should work on. [SEP] PM: and you have to go
The project manager opens the meeting , stating that it is about conceptual design. He restates the last meeting's descision that they will not do speech recognition technology but says they still have to decide whether to use an LCD screen. Then they move on to the three presentations. [SEP] PM: So each of you have
The marketing expert is first to present , and he talks about making a pleasant-looking device , particularly one that favors current trends. [SEP] ME: I didn't miss and I
They then begin talking about using a fruit , vegetable , or natural object as the shape of the remote , the logo , or for the buttons. [SEP] ME: Uh do you want a
Eventually they decide to make the device the shape of a banana. Next , the user interface specialist presents. [SEP] PM: So you are User Interface
The marketing expert annouces that the technology division of their company has developed an integrated programmeable sample speaker unit , which would allow a person to have a conversation with the remote control. They have the option of using that technology. [SEP] PM: {disfmarker} yeah comp {vocalsound} completely
The marketing expert shows them his plan what the remote control could look like and the features it might have. He suggests putting two scroll wheels- one for changing the channel and another for the volume. He also included a turbo button for speed , which he thinks every design should have. [SEP] UI: but you could you could
Since they can only charge twenty-five euro they decide to eliminate the LCD screen idea. [SEP] PM: So i it looks like
After that the interface specialist talks about having a base station for the purpose of finding the remote control when lost. The user could simply press a button on the base station and the remote control would start beeping. Lastly , the industrial designer presents , discussing the power source of the remote control. He suggests that they could have one of two kinds of power supplies- the usual batteries or rechargable ones if there is to be a base station and they could place solar cells on top for times when the lighting is good. [SEP] ID: when the lighting conditions are
The industrial designer talks about using plastic with elasticity so that the remote would not break into pieces if it fell , which relates to their earlier discussion about giving it a spongy design. In addition , he talks about giving the control a double curve , curves on both the sides so that it is easy to hold and handle. [SEP] ID: with plastic you can have
Plastic is also less costly than other options of wood or titanum. [SEP] PM: Yeah but it's more easier
They do not yet seem set about the idea of making it a banana shape , and one group member feels that the shape is not handy. [SEP] UI: But {gap} like a banana
The industrial desiger tells them they will use a regular chip rather than the advanced one since pricing is a factor. [SEP] ID: Pricing is a factor for
They agree on having base station with the remote. [SEP] ID: basis station is nothing more
They go on to have discussion , with one member suggesting that they make the banana more stylized so that it looks less like a banana- for example , it could be silver. [SEP] UI: Um , but you know
After that the project manager has them discuss/reiterate the decisions made during the meeting:  no LCD screen , the remote will have a base station , a RF for beeping , a button on the base station to press , possibly a stylish banana-shape for the control , 2 scroll wheels to control the volume and channels at the thumb level , a turbo button perhaps underneath the device , on/off button for the TV. [SEP] UI: Oh we need a we
The project manager goes through the minutes of the last meeting. [SEP] PM: {vocalsound} And also the use
They have the prototype presentation and talk about the final design , features , and power source , type of chip and weight of the remote. [SEP] ID: Yeah . So there was
They go through the evaulations , using the a list of criteria made by the marketing expert. [SEP] ME: I think I sh I
They rate each criteria on a scale of 0 (true) to 7 (false): how fancy it is , how handy it is , how functional , how cool it is , whether they would spend twenty five euro for it , and whether they would change their current remote for this one. [SEP] PM: So maybe maybe w we
Next they do a cost estimate for production. In doing this , they decide against solar cells and go with the rechargable batteries. They keep the regular chip , stick with plastic , put two scroll wheels and three push buttons , and make it a special shade of yellow. They eliminate the turbo button and give the remote a single curve because of budget restrictions. [SEP] PM: so we have margin for
They briefly evaulate the project process and close the meeting. [SEP] PM: {gap} Okay so thanks very

The project manager gave the team members their assignments and then the team went over the decisions they had made and discussed whether to use titanium or rubber in their design. [SEP] ME: Because the trend goes faster
This last meeting started with the presentation of a remote control prototype. [SEP] PM: Okay . So first ,
It has on-off and volume buttons , an LCD screen (it can be active or switched off) in various colours , which largely replaces the use of push buttons , and a jog-wheel for navigation and option selection in the menus presented on the LCD. It also includes speech recognition as an alternative interface , which also serves as mechanism for locating the device. It was designed to be powered by a single battery. The casing will be made of titanium with rubber strawberries following the fruit and veg fashion. The prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) in terms of fancifulness , technology , robustness , usefulness , size , colour and shape and customizability: the average mark was 2.17; the team were satisfied with their prototype , although after costs were calculated it proved very expensive. [SEP] ID: Titanium .
Finally , the team evaluated the whole process: they deemed themselves a good team , they found there was plenty of room for creativity and they liked the project manager's leadership. [SEP] ME: Team-work , very strong ,
The Project Manager introduced the project to the group. [SEP] PM: So people can {gap} can

The group began a discussion about their initial ideas for the product. [SEP] UI: Yeah , it should be
They discussed several usability features: adding speech recognition and an option to choose what to watch by channel or by content , reducing the number of buttons by using the television screen to display options , and adding a light adaptation system. All participants were instructed to gather more information for the next meeting , the functional design meeting. [SEP] ID: I think that's the {gap}
The Project Manager presented the goals of the meeting and new product requirements. [SEP] PM: So , let's start with
The Industrial Designer presented the internal components of a remote control and showed a diagram of how they operate together. [SEP] ID: um f transform the data
The industrial designer suggested that field programmable gateway arrays be used for the chip controlling software functionalities , and it was suggested that the remote be used with a recharging stand. [SEP] ID: Also , but but {vocalsound}
The User Interface Designer gave a presentation on the technical functions of the remote , and displayed the interfaces of two existing products for comparison. [SEP] UI: This is the most competing
The user interface designer showed that the competitors' remotes were too complicated. [SEP] UI: so we don't want that
The user interface designer suggested that the televisions that the remotes are used with connect to the internet to access downloadable programs. [SEP] ID: and we can try t
The user interface designer suggested a simple design with few buttons , small size , and a locator function. [SEP] UI: {vocalsound} And {gap} responds to
The Marketing Expert presented several characteristics important to users. He discussed using speech recognition and ways to make it feasible for the project , small size , low price point , and incorporating teletext in different languages. [SEP] ME: So , the remote {disfmarker}
The group discussed the new requirement that required them to omit teletext from their design , and discussed the possibility of using the remote to access the internet through the television. [SEP] UI: Yeah . Because all the
The Industrial Designer presented options for each component. He suggested kinetic energy , a titanium case , and rubber push buttons. [SEP] ID: and by {disfmarker} well by
The group will ask if the kinetic energy component can provide enough energy. [SEP] ID: we can uh see in
The User Interface Designer introduced the graphical user interface to the group and suggested using an LCD screen. [SEP] PM: A graphical user interface emphasise
The user interface designer presented several existing products and suggested the following: large buttons; voice recognition; either push , scroll , or spinning buttons; and incorporating some customizable components. [SEP] ID: because uh adding wheels or
The group discussed including a help button; it was decided that it would make the device seem more complicated. [SEP] ME: And let us see what
The Marketing Expert presented that users found remotes too easily lost , complicated , and ugly. He showed that users were willing to pay more for a fancy remote. [SEP] ME: So keeping in view all
The marketing expert suggested the LCD screen; the group felt that it was better to utilize the user's television as a display screen , but that they would inquire about cost before deciding. [SEP] ME: {vocalsound} I mean that should
The group will inquire about the cost of voice recognition and scroll buttons. [SEP] ID: so uh I think to
The group discussed incorporating a locator function and customization for children. [SEP] ME: Yeah I think it should
They discussed the sensitivity of the voice recognizer to other noises; the group will ask about the capability of the recognizer. [SEP] ME: So I think we should
The User Interface Designer and the Industrial Designer presented two prototypes , one with an LCD screen and one without. They demonstrated how to navigate through the menus and presented the voice recognition and energy source components and the charging stand. [SEP] UI: and this can be used
The production costs were below budget for the basic models. They discussed their modular design. They discussed the parental control module and the titanium casing. [SEP] PM: it's below the the the

The project manager briefed the team on some new requirements and led them in a discussion in which the team discussed their target group and made decisions on the appearance and functions of their upcoming product. [SEP] PM: postpone further discussion to uh
After the project manager opened the meeting , the industrial designer discussed his preference for making a remote which is single-curved , made of rubber , contains an LCD , has a docking station to recharge the batteries , and uses a simple chip. The user interface designer discussed how speech recognition could be useful to users who often lose their remotes , the layout of the interface , and the option to include a scroll device on the side of the remote to access a menu containing extra features. [SEP] UI: so you could scroll scroll
The marketing expert discussed the results of trend-watching reports and his preference for a banana-like remote for younger people and a traditional remote for older people. The trend-watching reports indicated that products should be fancy , innovative , easy to use , in fruity colors , in soft and spongy materials , and in hard materials in autumn colors with square shapes with round edges if appealing to elderly people. [SEP] ME: I think like my colleague
The team discussed case shapes , color options , types of rubber , and dimensions. [SEP] UI: And and do we have
The team then made decisions regarding energy sources , components , and the remote interface. [SEP] PM: And I think I would

The marketing expert conducted a project evaluation of the prototype. The team found the remote to be fancy , innovative , fairly easy to use , available in different colors , fairly spongy , difficult to misplace , and targeted to younger people. [SEP] UI: so it's pretty good .
The project manager then led the team in calculating the production costs of their remote. [SEP] ME: We have to lower it
The team had difficulty in meeting the the target cost and had to eliminate some of the more expensive components they had hoped to include in their design. [SEP] PM: because I think uh we
The project manager then led the team in an evaluation of the project process. The team found the project stressful , the equipment useful , the information available to them lacking , and their laptops to be slow and heavy. [SEP] PM: more time during the individual
The marketing expert and industrial designer had problems with their laptops. [SEP] UI: Never close your laptop .
The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the project , to design a remote control. The remote should be trendy , original and user friendly. [SEP] PM: Every uh level of design
The project manager explained how to use the SMARTboard , and the group did a tool training exercise , using the SMARTboard to draw their favourite animals. [SEP] PM: and then we are uh

The project manager opened the meeting. [SEP] PM: And I'm gonna show you
The industrial designer reported on working design , explaining how a remote control works and describing its main components. [SEP] ID: Uh , the circuit board
The user interface designer talked about what functions should be included. He suggested they should focus on either expert or novice users. The basic functions should include an on/off switch , buttons for channels one to nine , volume , mute and buttons for next and previous channel. He suggested that a trendy design should not have many buttons. The marketing expert reported on user requirements , including how users rated the importance of different features. He stressed that a trendy design is important , that users zap a lot , and that remotes often get lost. [SEP] ME: And a trendy look ,
The project manager informed the group of new requirements. The remote is only for TV , should not include a teletext feature , and should feature the company colour and slogan. [SEP] PM: Our product's corporate colour and
The group discussed what functions and features the remote should have , and whether to include DVD/VCR controls , a teletext button , stop button , changeable covers , and a base/recharger with locator function. [SEP] PM: And and what people just
The group also discussed making the remote a rounded , ergonomic shape , and using flashing lights to help locate it when lost. [SEP] ME: I think I think that'll
The industrial designer talked about the options available for materials and components. He suggested that the case should be double-curved , and be made from plastic and rubber rather than wood or titanium. He also recommended using basic batteries rather than solar or kinetic power. [SEP] ID: {vocalsound} I th I got
The industrial designer also mentioned the possibility of using an LCD screen to add something special. [SEP] ID: and it's possible , but
The user interface designer went over the functions to be included in the remote. [SEP] UI: And I um {disfmarker} {vocalsound}
The group discussed using large buttons for the most frequently used functions. [SEP] PM: It puts an extra accent
The marketing expert gave a presentation on trend watching. A fancy look and feel is most important to users , followed by technological innovation and ease of use. The younger market also likes the theme of fruit and vegetables and spongy material , which could be implemented through fruity colours and using a spongy material for the base. [SEP] ME: Yeah , also a bit
The group discussed how to incorporate a fruit and vegetable theme , as well as the company colours and logo. [SEP] PM: I think this is kind
The group discussed whether to include an LCD screen , and eventually decided against it. [SEP] PM: Okay , we s skip
The project manager closed the meeting and told the group they would receive emails about their tasks for the next meeting. [SEP] ID: What are we going to
The project manager opened the meeting. [SEP] PM: Oh , we're gonna have
The user interface designer and industrial designer presented the prototype design. The remote has buttons for power , mute , teletext , volume and channel up/down , and nine numbered channel buttons. The group discussed what buttons would be needed to enter channels 10 and above. [SEP] ID: No , you have to
They discussed adapting the docking station so it could be used with other products but did not make a decision. [SEP] PM: because uh maybe we have
The remote is plastic with different coloured rubber strips on the sides and rubber buttons. [SEP] PM: But uh , and we
The marketing expert led the product evaluation. The group were generally satisfied with the design but did not think the remote was technologically innovative. [SEP] PM: Yeah , make it a
The overall score was 2.6. [SEP] PM: which is uh quite a
The group worked out the manufacturing costs. The group had problems figuring out the cost of the docking station and buttons , and did not know which kind of chip to use. [SEP] ID: Then we have one Euro
They discussed using kinetic energy to make the remote more technologically innovative but decided against it. [SEP] PM: Okay , then we d
They eventually decided that they could not afford a docking station. [SEP] PM: No no , it's not
They did not have time to evaluate the project process before the end of the meeting. [SEP] ME: Yes , yes . Celebration
After introducing the remote control objective , the project manager demonstrated the SmartBoard technology they would be using. [SEP] PM: but it does work sometimes
They tested it by drawing animals. [SEP] PM: It's a cat . {vocalsound}
The project manager informed the group of the budget , before beginning the discussion of current remotes and initial ideas. [SEP] PM: Well uh just w we're
They considered taking the best of their competitors designs and making a multifunction remote. It needs to be useable internationally , with few buttons. [SEP] PM: and w if we pick
The considered options for the shape of the remote control , imagining how it would fit in the hand. [SEP] ME: and maybe we should use
The group ended the discussion by touching very briefly on some materials issues , and discussed remote covers. [SEP] PM: Well our user interface you
There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only , they should ignore the teletext function , as it is dated , and , also , the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product. The target group will be people below 30. [SEP] PM: Well and uh our corporate
It transpires that customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes , especially if they include LCD screens and speech recognition. Functions like zapping are very prevalent , as well as complaints about remotes being difficult to learn and easy to lose. [SEP] ME: They also like that ,
The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip , and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. [SEP] ID: Now the LED produces an
The team agreed to follow a user-centred approach and simplify the design by somehow minimising the number of buttons. Other functions are served by push buttons: OK , menu , screen sizing , AV , settings buttons , mute , digits 1-9 , power , volume control , channel up/down with the last three types being prominent on the device. [SEP] ID: Yeah . I think that's
They plan to include an LCD screen to display relevant information. [SEP] ME: Alright , we go with
The exact design and placement of the components will be decided in the next meeting. [SEP] PM: and the design comes into
For the conceptual design , the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks and texture over technological innovation; however , they both seem to be more important than ease of use. [SEP] ME: {vocalsound} Uh the last point
The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote. Materials also need to be strong: the marketing expert suggested an iron-plate or titanium front. [SEP] PM: Well the the handy thing
The industrial designer suggested they use rubber push buttons (and no scroll wheel) , simple battery (instead of solar cells or kinetic dynamo) , and advanced chip. He also advised that the users within the target group prefer primary colours , soft textures and curved shapes. [SEP] ID: so we uh we do
Speech recognition can be implemented , but it does not link speech commands to remote control actions. [SEP] UI: No it doesn't does not
The team drew a provisional prototype. [SEP] ID: Can you draw it now
They placed the LCD below the buttons. If it is implemented , a recording button , microphone and speaker need to be included in the design. [SEP] UI: And oh I think as
Finally , they decided to have a titanium case with plastic front and the company logo and slogan engraved. [SEP] PM: Okay .
Packages with a variety of changeable fronts will be launched. [SEP] PM: Launch different lines at once
The ID and UI presented the drawing of a prototype. It is rounded , with the front made of hard plastic in different colours. The back , as well as the lower part of the front are made of titanium. [SEP] ID: and the rest of it
The back has the logo and slogan of the company engraved in its middle. The buttons include oval digit buttons , arrow-shaped channel and volume controls in the middle; below those , is the menu (for the LCD) and the video button. The LCD can be found at the lower section of the device. [SEP] ID: And the company slogan ,
After the presentation , the product was evaluated. [SEP] ME: I'm going to do uh
This was done on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad) on fancifulness , ease of use , finding the device when it is lost , hi-tech features , incorporation of fashion trends , and ergonomic design. [SEP] PM: Is the material attractive ?
Because it was over budget , titanium was replaced by plastic and the speech recognition was discarded. [SEP] ID: So we have to use
They thought it would have been more sensible to have the component costs before the prototype design. Finally , the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (generally satisfied) , leadership (the process was democratic , not happy with management) , teamwork (happy with it) , and means (SMARTboard was 'a disaster' and the digital pens only good for drawings). [SEP] ME: Yeah , it might be
For the first meeting , the task of designing a remote control was briefly introduced along with the plan for the subsequent meetings. [SEP] PM: So we'll discuss that later
The group then drew animals to practise using the drawing platform. [SEP] ME: Okay .
They discussed their likes and dislikes regarding current remote controls , including ease of use , multiple systems and power indicators. [SEP] ME: So it would be nice
They then offered suggestions as to what they would like from their remote. They would like the remote to be durable , for it to include a device to help find it when lost and not use too many batteries. [SEP] ID: So you don't {disfmarker} won't
The project manager opened the meeting by explaining how to locate his minutes from the previous meeting. [SEP] PM: You'll find the next minutes
The Industrial Designer briefly explained the internal workings of the remote ,  and mentioned his preferences for power source and case material. [SEP] ID: Then I think uh the
The industrial designer also suggested mobile phone-like changeable covers , and the group discussed the profit in this. [SEP] PM: but I don't think we
The User Interface Designer very briefly mentioned some features a remote should have and suggested it should be multifunctional. [SEP] UI: So uh I didn't know
The Marketing Expert present the findings of the usability study. [SEP] ME: So the design of our
The group then discussed their target group ,and what features they might include to attract them. [SEP] PM: So I think that can
The manager introduced new requirements to the project , insisting they were to be followed. The group then discussed what buttons they might need , which included menu , numbers , channel and volume changing arrows and mute. [SEP] UI: Mute .
The industrial designer gave a presentation on the interface concept , discussing which buttons will be needed and then looking at some examples of existing remote controls. [SEP] UI: The icons on the arrows
The industrial designer suggested using a yellow case with rounded edges and the logo at the bottom , and large , clearly marked buttons. [SEP] UI: Uh , yeah so good
The interface expert informed the group that young people like curved shapes , soft materials and primary colours , and suggested making a hand-shaped remote in plastic and rubber. They put off making a final decision about using an LCD screen , scroll buttons and a menu button until they could find out about costs. He talked about the possibility of using a scroll button , and the different chips which could be used. The group discussed using an LCD screen , but did not have enough information about costs to make a decision. [SEP] ID: The display requires a advanced
The marketing expert talked about new trends , including the trends for spongy materials and fruit and vegetable themed products. [SEP] ME: It it it might last
The group had a discussion and decided to create two designs , one with an LCD screen and one without , and the interface designer drew them on the board. [SEP] ID: Hard plastic , uh the
The industrial designer and user interface designer presented their prototype design , made of yellow rubber and hard plastic , with large , mostly blue buttons , a joystick and LCD screen. [SEP] PM: So , that's it .
Led by the marketing expert , the group evaluated the prototype on a scale of one to seven , based on a set of evaluation criteria. [SEP] ID: Something what also younger people
The overall rating was two. [SEP] ME: So , according to our
The project manager calculated the production costs , which were too high at fifteen Euros. [SEP] PM: So , we have to
The group discussed how to make the design cheaper , and decided to keep the LCD screen , but to remove the special colour and replace the joystick with regular push-buttons. [SEP] PM: Very good .
Finally the project manager led an evaluation of the project process before closing the meeting. Overall , the group were satisfied with the creativity , teamwork and available equipment , although the marketing expert thought the SMARTboard and laptops were sometimes distracting and not that helpful. [SEP] PM: Evaluation ready .
The project manager opened the meeting and introduced the project , describing what the project would involve , the role of each participant and the agenda for the first meeting. [SEP] PM: How exactly does it work
The project manager the demonstrated the equipment the group would be using , and the group practiced using the SMARTboard by drawing their favourite animals. [SEP] PM: Okay , so um you
The project manager then went over the project budget. [SEP] PM: And um the production costs
The industrial designer gave a brief presentation about his role and his initial ideas for the project , suggesting that the remote should be used for multiple devices and that the group should consider using bluetooth rather than infrared. [SEP] ID: but take these things into
The project manager then asked the others about their initial ideas. The user interface designer agreed that the remote should control multiple devices. They also discussed having glow in the dark buttons , using bluetooth instead of infrared and using a display and/or a joystick instead of conventional buttons. However , they were unsure about what the budget would allow. [SEP] UI: Always have s the soft
The project manager suggested that the remote should be rechargeable or not use much power , but this might be difficult if using bluetooth. [SEP] UI: But you can't you can't
The project manager closed the meeting. [SEP] PM: See you in thirty minutes
There are some new requirements for the project: the device will have to be for TV only , they should ignore the teletext function , as it is dated , and , also , the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product. The target group will be people below 40. [SEP] PM: {vocalsound} then for Roo ,
The UI preferred an easy-to-use remote to a multi-function one. [SEP] UI: But my {disfmarker} in {gap}
The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip , and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. [SEP] ID: which generates messages using uh
The use of infrared , energy-efficient power source and cheap circuit was suggested. [SEP] ID: {vocalsound} Um for cost-effectiveness ,
The remote could light up via LED's placed inside. Functions like zapping are very prevalent , as well as complaints about remotes being easy to lose. [SEP] PM: It should be an easy
It also transpires that customers like innovative technology like speech recognition. [SEP] ME: 'cause young people uh like
The design can focus on such customer needs , like finding a mechanism to locate a lost remote. The functions of the remote will include a back button to switch between two channels , volume , program selection , and speech recognition , with a focus on simplicity of design. [SEP] ID: we've decided to implement a
For the conceptual design , the marketing expert talked about the public's preference for looks over technological innovation; however , they both seem to be more important than ease of use. [SEP] ME: and a fancy look and
The current fashion among younger people favours bright colours and fruit and vegetable themes and spongy materials: pertinent exchangeable fronts can express such trends on the remote , and could also provide themes for other target groups. They could also add some rubber to provide easy grip of the device. [SEP] PM: And what I'm thinking about
Cases can be flat , single- or double-curved. They can be made of plastic , rubber , wood or titanium. [SEP] ID: uh which is the same
Hand or kinetic dynamos , batteries , and solar cells can be used as energy sources. [SEP] ID: And we of course have
Possible interfaces are push buttons , scroll wheels , and LCDs . A way to make this device different would be to use a scroll-wheel on the side with integrated button for volume control and mute. [SEP] PM: And click it to muten
Speech recognition can be implemented by adding a sample sensor and speaker on the remote. [SEP] ID: And there is something like
The team will design a single-curved device with a scroll wheel and speech recognition , in black and yellow , the company colours. The final decisions also included combined battery with solar cells. [SEP] PM: the voice recognition we already
The UI and ID presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design. It can be used as a normal remote , but the speech recognition also provides a more advanced alternative interface. The rubber case is yellow with grey or black , with buttons either made of plastic or rubber. [SEP] ID: grey or black or something
An extra button could activate/deactivate the voice recognition. [SEP] ID: okay . Okay , yeah
The prototype proved extremely over budget. The main contributing factors were the solar cell and speech recognition. One way to compensate for the loss of features , but still attract their target group , would be to add more colour to the design. [SEP] PM: Although I think we {disfmarker}
The criteria used were fancifulness (2) , technological innovation (2) , ease of use (2.5) , whether it is easy to find (1) , sponginess (1.5) , number of features (1). [SEP] PM: I'll give it uh a
After the costing , the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad). [SEP] PM: we are evaluating this this
The speech recognition works as a finding mechanism as well. [SEP] UI: but you c you can
Finally , the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (choices too narrow) , leadership and teamwork (happy with it , but they missed communicating in between meetings) , and means (SMARTboard was not satisfactory , but the digital pens were alright , but not too useful). The delay in providing costs of components was criticised. [SEP] ID: The drawing cap capabilities are
The team comprises the project manager , the marketing expert , who is looking at user needs , the user interface designer , looking at usability , and the industrial designer , working on the engineering and materials. The project will be completed with three further meetings: the following meeting concerns the functional design. The goal of the project is to design an original , trendy and user-friendly remote control for TV. The project manager gave a quick overview of the equipment available. [SEP] PM: The project I got was
The whole team tried out the SMARTboard , by drawing their favourite animals. [SEP] PM: I introduce to the world
Afterwards , they discussed briefly their first ideas , including the use of light materials and usability concerns. [SEP] ID: is uh the the material
The remote  needs to be produced for 12.50 euros in order to be sold for double that amount. [SEP] PM: The production price , twelve
Customers are willing to pay more for fancier looking remotes. [SEP] ME: they want to spend money
It also transpires that remotes are easy to lose. [SEP] ME: that was {gap} in the
Everyone agreed that they need to incorporate a locating mechanism in their design , and that changeable covers could make appealing-looking remotes. They like innovative technology like speech recognition and LCD screens. The need for clarity of button functions was mentioned. [SEP] PM: So we agree on the
The function of the remote is relatively simple: by pressing a button a current is passed to the chip , and defines what signal is to be sent to the receiver (the TV) via infrared. [SEP] ID: You have infrared
There are some new requirements: the target group will be people below 40 , the device will have to be for TV only , they should ignore the teletext function , and , also , the remote should be recognisable as a Real Reaction product. [SEP] PM: {disfmarker} And one thing that
On the other hand , materials should be more durable. [SEP] PM: you should you should look
They drew some of their ideas , and discussed the positioning of the buttons and the LCD. [SEP] PM: I think the channel button
It might be possible to use a charger for the remote. [SEP] PM: to have uh like sort
The concept of the design will be finalised in the next meeting. [SEP] PM: to have uh like sort
The most used buttons are going to be placed on top. [SEP] PM: just keep in mind that
The UI and ID presented a prototype drawing of the remote control design. The rubber case is yellow with black buttons and dark yellow for the menus. [SEP] UI: We chose a different type
There are buttons for teletext , favourite channel , mute and OK. It incorporates both LCD screen and speech recognition. [SEP] PM: we have advanced chips and
The prototype proved over budget (17 euros). The main contributing factors were the LCD and speech recognition. The latter was taken out , along with the special colour. [SEP] PM: think I had the best
Everyone agreed that the financial information should not have been given to them at the last moment. After the costing , the original prototype was evaluated on a scale of 1(excellent)-7(very bad). The criteria used were look and feel (1) , whether it is easy to find (1) , whether it is easy to learn (2) , use of LCD (3) , speech recognition (7) , trendiness (2). [SEP] PM: 'Cause yeah , that gives
Finally , the team evaluated the project process in terms of creativity (satisfactory) , leadership and teamwork (happy with it , but they missed communicating in between meetings) , and means (SMARTboard could be improved in terms of response time , the digital pens could not be used on more than one page at the same time). [SEP] ID: So we cannot work on
Finally , the decided to call their design Triple-R. [SEP] UI: Triple R_ it is .
